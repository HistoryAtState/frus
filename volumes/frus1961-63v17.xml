                <p><hi rend="italic">The Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President <persName>George Bush</persName> on
                    October 28, 1991. Section 198 of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 102–138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provided supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>
                <p>The editors of this volume are convinced that it meets all regulatory, statutory,
                    and scholarly standards of selection and editing. Although <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>this volume records policies and events of more
                    than 30 years ago, the Foreign Relations statute, allows the Department until
                    1996 to reach the 30-year line in the publication of the series.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations
                        Series</hi></p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series for the years 1961–1963. The subseries presents in 25
                    print volumes and 5 microfiche supplements a documentary record of major foreign
                    policy decisions and actions of the administration of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">John F. Kennedy</persName>. The record of U.S. policy
                    toward the nations of the Near East during 1961–1963 has been compiled in two
                    print volumes and one microfiche supplement.</p>
                <p>This volume presents the documentary record with respect to the nations of the
                    Near East, including the Arab-Israeli dispute, for the period January 1, 1961,
                    through June 30, 1962. Specific countries covered include Iran, Iraq, Israel,
                    Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria, and the United Arab Republic. The next volume in
                    the series, <ref target="frus1961-63v18">volume XVIII</ref>, will extend the
                    record through December 31, 1963. A separate microfiche supplement will comprise
                    additional documentation, regarded by the editors as significant but of somewhat
                    lesser importance, on these countries, Yemen, the British Crown Colony and
                    Protectorates of Aden, the Arab-Israeli dispute, and the Near East region for
                    the entire 1961–1963 triennium.</p>
                <p>For the purposes of this subseries, documentation on the countries of North
                    Africa (Libya, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia) is included in <ref target="frus1961-63v21">volume XXI</ref>, Africa.</p>
                <p>The documents in the print <ref target="frus1961-63v17">volumes XVII</ref> and
                        <ref target="frus1961-63v18">XVIII</ref> are arranged in one chronological
                    sequence; a Topical List of Documents is printed on pages XLIII–LIX.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the Foreign Relations series include all records needed to provide
                    comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy decisions and actions of the
                    U.S. Government. It further requires that government agencies, departments, and
                    other entities of the U.S. Government cooperate with the Department of State
                    Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign
                    policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. The
                    editor believes that in terms of access this volume was prepared in accordance
                    with the standards and mandates of the statute, although access to some records
                    was restricted, as noted below.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Sources for the Foreign Relations
                    Series</hi></p>
                <p>The editors have had complete access to all the retired records and papers in the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>decentralized (“lot files”) of the Department at
                    the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the Department’s Executive
                    Secretariat, which contain the records of international conferences and
                    high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders by the President
                    and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between the President and
                    Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic
                    posts. Certain intelligence-related files maintained in the Bureau of
                    Intelligence and Research were unknown to the Department historians at the time
                    this volume was compiled. Arrangements have been made for Department historians
                    to have access to these records for future volumes.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have
                    access to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                    and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and
                    preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant
                    foreign affairs-related documentation from other federal agencies including the
                    National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of
                    Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. All of this documentation has been made
                    available for use in the Foreign Relations series thanks to the consent of these
                    agencies and the cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have full access to records of the Department
                    of Defense, particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
                    Secretary of Defense and his major assistants.</p>
                <p>As noted above, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires
                    that the editors have full and complete access to all records pertinent to
                    foreign policy decisions and actions. Since early 1991, the Central Intelligence
                    Agency, in cooperation with the Department of State, has provided expanded
                    access to Department historians to high-level intelligence documents from those
                    records still in the custody of that Agency. Department historians’ expanded
                    access was arranged by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of
                    Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency. This access arrangement coincided
                    with the research of volumes for the 1961–1963 triennium. As Department of State
                    and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians have continued to work out
                    the procedural and scholarly aspects of this access, the variety of
                    documentation made available and selected for publication in the volumes
                    expanded. For this volume, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians
                    made relevant intelligence files available to the editor. The specific <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> files are named in the List of Sources (<ref target="#pg_XV">pp. XV</ref>–<ref target="#pg_XXV">XXV</ref>).</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Principles of Document Selection for the
                        Foreign Relations Series</hi></p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>in detail, in brief, or in summary. Some
                    general decisions are also made regarding issues that cannot be documented in
                    the volume but will be addressed in a microfiche supplement or in
                    bibliographical notes.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Individual compiler-editors
                    vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
                    documentation. The compiler-editors also tend to apply these selection criteria
                    in accordance with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards
                    of scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors give
                    priority to unpublished classified records, rather than previously published
                    records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>

                            Volume XVII</ref></hi></p>
                <p>The editor of this volume, the research and editing of which was completed in
                    1992, has defined a “major issue” as one that received high-level attention
                    within the U.S. Government, from the President, key White House aides, or
                    Cabinet-level officials; and/or had long-range repercussions for U.S. foreign
                    policy and interests in the region. While it was impossible to include the
                    details of U.S. policy on every issue, documentation has been included, either
                    in the print volume or the microfiche supplement, that delineates basic U.S.
                    policies toward the countries in question.</p>
                <p>The primary focus of the documents in this volume is on the foreign policymaking
                    process of the U.S. Government, including documentation illuminating policy
                    formulation and major aspects and repercussions of its execution. Emphasis is
                    placed on official memoranda that reveal policy positions, show differences
                    within the U.S. Government over policy formulation, summarize developments and
                    positions regarding an issue, contain intelligence or military assessments, and
                    describe decisions or actions taken at the National Security Council. Some key
                    instructions sent to diplomatic posts in the region are included when they
                    demonstrate the details of the execution of foreign policy. Memoranda of
                    conversations with foreign leaders both abroad and in Washington were selected
                    to provide additional information on the origins and impact of foreign policy
                    decisions.</p>
                <p>The editor selected only the most important reports from diplomatic posts
                    containing descriptions and assessments of the political and economic situation,
                    social conditions, and technological and scientific concerns, and the records of
                    the most significant conversations held with foreign leaders and their
                    diplomatic representatives. Details of specific military and economic assistance
                    programs or their implementation are <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>not included. The volumes and microfiche supplement contain finished U.S.
                    intelligence assessments but do not deal with intelligence sources and
                    methods.</p>
                <p>Documentation selected by the editor for inclusion in the microfiche supplement
                    provides additional details on the major issues covered in both <ref target="frus1961-63v17">volume XVII</ref> (presented here) and <ref target="frus1961-63v18">volume XVIII</ref> (scheduled for publication in
                    1995). Also included in the supplement are selected documents on certain
                    bilateral relations not included in the printed volumes. The annotation to
                    printed documents contains references to some, but not all, documents included
                    in the microfiche supplement. The supplement also includes several lengthy
                    attachments to printed documents and the discussion sections of National
                    Intelligence Estimates and Special National Intelligence Estimates, the summary
                    portions of which appear in the print volumes. In these cases, the printed
                    document contains editorial references to the appropriate microfiche document.
                    The volumes may be used without the supplement, but the microfiche should be
                    used in conjunction with the printed volumes.</p>

                                United Arab Republic</hi>. An important focus of the volume is the
                            policy discussion and debate within the U.S. Government concerning the
                            possibility of improving U.S. relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. This policy review addressed questions of U.S.
                            economic assistance to the United Arab Republic and whether to invite

                            programs are not covered in detail. The volume includes reports of

                    than the time of transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed according to

                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the

                <p>The unnumbered first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source,

                    footnote also provides the background of important documents and policies and

                <p>The declassification review of this volume between 1992 and 1994 resulted in the
                    decision to withhold a little less than 2 percent of the documents originally
                    selected. The remaining documents provide an account of the major foreign policy
                    issues confronting, and the policies undertaken by, the U.S. Government
                    concerning the Near East during this period.</p>

                    Department of State, other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the

                        main Senate Foreign Relations Room. Senator <persName corresp="#p_GAE2">Gore</persName> was in the chair. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MC6">Marcy</persName> and Newhouse of Committee staff were present but no
                        transcript was taken.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_GAE2">Gore</persName> told those present that
                        he had given his word to the Department that there would be no publicity
                        regarding this very informal” meeting. He said the issue was a sensitive
                        one. The other Senators agreed.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> followed in his presentation
                        the greater part of the document which he had brought with him but did not
                        get an opportunity, owing to the interruptions, to describe the “side
                        effects” of the Dimona reactor.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0062"/>
                    <p>It was evident that all those present, but particularly Senators <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAE2">Gore</persName>, were annoyed that Israel had not only
                        concealed its activity but had “deliberately misled” the United States
                        Government. Senator <persName corresp="#p_GAE2">Gore</persName> questioned
                        closely <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName>’ statement that
                        Israeli officials had told U.S. officials, when asked about the buildings
                        lying 25 miles southwest of Beersheba, that it was first a “textile plant”
                        and then a “metallurgical works”. He asked whether there was a record of
                        these statements by the Israelis. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> said that he doubted whether there was more of a
                        record than recent telegrams from our Embassy in Tel Aviv. Statements could
                        have been made by Israeli officials who were not really “in the know”.
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> said that he had
                        definite knowledge that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had “lied”
                        to an American official (whom he did not identify) in the late summer or
                        early fall. This official “did not belong to the State Department”. Asked
                        whether it was Dr. Gomberg, Senator <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> said it was not.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> said it was the
                        secrecy factor which troubled him: if the Israelis had nothing to hide, as
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> statements indicated; why did they
                        hide it? <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> explained that there
                        was validity in the Israeli fear of intensified Arab boycott of its
                        suppliers if reactor was constructed openly. The fault on the Israeli side
                        lay in keeping the reactor secret too long: long after the buildings were
                        plainly visible from a public road.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> was concerned by
                        the cost figures of the overall project. He did not believe the $5,000,000
                        per year foreign exchange costs for four years mentioned by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_GAE2">Gore</persName> was concerned by the
                        effect of the existence of the Dimona reactor upon the Arabs and wanted to
                        know what firm evidence the Department had that knowledge of Dimona had
                        driven them into the hands of the Russians. He was interested in the January
                        28 meeting of the Arab League and wondered whether any drastic decisions
                        would emerge therefrom. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName>
                        replied that he felt at this stage the Arabs would confine themselves to
                        talk—after all plutonium from Dimona was three or four years away. He said
                        there had been an indication that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had asked the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        for help to build a 30–40 megawatt reactor in Egypt—comparable to
                        Dimona.</p>
                    <p>The Senators appeared to accept the Department’s thesis that another round of
                        publicity would be unhelpful. Senator <persName corresp="#p_GAE2">Gore</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> to
                        advise him if “anything new” emerged from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>’s call on the Secretary January
                            11.<note n="1" xml:id="d2fn1">The memorandum of conversation is ibid.,

                        <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> promised to do this.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0063"/>
                    <p>The Senators also appeared to accept the idea that if the United States were
                        to take measures against Israel this might be a signal for intensified Arab
                        action against Israel.</p>
                    <p>Senators <persName corresp="#p_SJJ2">Sparkman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> at different times expressed
                        doubts that the United States could force Israel as a sovereign state to
                        reveal full information if Israel did not choose to supply it. Both
                        commented, however, that the United States had various means of pressure
                        which it could apply to Israel if this needed.</p>
                    <p>The Senators also appeared to accept <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName>’ thesis that the problem of plutonium produced in
                        reactors goes far beyond Israel—that it would be unfair to publicly brand
                        Israel as a villain on suspicion that it might—three or four years
                        hence—divert some plutonium to weapons. All reactors everywhere produce some
                        plutonium. This pointed up the need for generally applicable international
                        inspection and control.</p>
                    <p>The Senators listened with keen interest to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPJ1">Farley</persName>’s elucidation of the kind of control which the
                        International Atomic Energy Agency might exercise in the future and the
                        present narrow range of its safeguards activities. <persName corresp="#p_FPJ1">Farley</persName> also explained in response to
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_GAE2">Gore</persName>’s request his views on
                        the latest Soviet attitude towards suspension of atomic testing.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName>, towards the end
                        of the meeting, said that he agreed that atomic energy is a coming thing.
                        “Peacefully applied atomic energy is like electricity: whether we like it or
                        not countries are going to get it”. The United States cannot and should not
                        attempt to keep countries like Israel from getting into the field. The
                        problem is how to assure that atomic energy is used <hi rend="italic">only</hi> for peaceful purposes.</p>
                    <p>In general, the discussion moved from the specific case of the Dimona
                        reactor, about which Israel had been so regrettably secretive, to the more
                        general problem of peaceful uses and control over comparable reactors
                        elsewhere in the world.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Ramey</hi>: At the conclusion of the closed
                        hearing on December 9, 1960, Representative Durham requested Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPJ1">Farley</persName> to inform the Joint Committee on
                        Atomic Energy of subsequent information received concerning the Israeli
                        atomic energy program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPJ1">Farley</persName>
                        subsequently advised the Committee staff that, at the first meeting between
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> and the Israeli
                        Ambassador later on December 9, the Ambassador disclaimed any detailed
                        knowledge of the reactor installation near Dimona. Our inquiries of the
                        Israeli Government and also of the French Government have been pressed since
                        that time. In accordance with the Committee’s request and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPJ1">Farley</persName>’s telephone conversation with Mr.
                        Conway on January 13, the enclosed summary of the information obtained is
                        submitted for the information of the Committee. Also attached for your
                        convenience is a compilation of public statements.<note n="1" xml:id="d3fn1">Attached but not printed.</note> Responsible officers of the Department
                        of State will be available to discuss this information with the Committee if
                        desired.</p>
                    <p>The official statements which the Israeli and French Governments have now
                        given us are unequivocal as to the non-military character of the Israeli
                        program and French assistance to it. We do not anticipate that these
                        Governments will provide us with significant additional information in the
                        near future. You will note, however, that we have been given formal
                        assurance that visitors from the United States or another friendly country
                        will be received when the present intense public interest in the question
                        has subsided. We believe that this will be very helpful in providing
                        first-hand reassurance, and we intend to follow up this offer at an early
                        date.</p>
                    <p>Any possibility of proliferation of nuclear weapons—particularly in the
                        Middle East—obviously is a matter of grave concern to the Department. We
                        shall continue to follow this matter closely. We do not believe, however,
                        that extended public speculation regarding the Israeli atomic energy program
                        will advance the interests of the United States, and we have taken and will
                        continue to take any feasible measures to damp down speculation on this
                        matter and in particular to avoid giving <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0065"/>occasion for renewed suspicions and possible undesirable reactions in the
                        Arab world. We believe that persistent but quiet diplomatic approaches are
                        most likely to be productive.</p>
                    <p>The continued cooperation of the Joint Committee in avoiding public comment
                        is most helpful in this regard.</p>

                                in due course, perhaps in ten years but possibly no sooner than

                                interest has quieted down. In particular, a scientist from the

                                research reactor, that the French will supply all the uranium for
                                this reactor, that the plutonium produced in the reactor will all be
                                returned to France, that adequate arrangements have been agreed upon

                                resident French inspectors or periodic inspection visits will be
                                accepted. The French assured us that they do not want to be

                            However, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are concerned that plans for Iran may

                            which may call for U.S. military action of some kind. This action could
                            range from assistance in counter-subversion efforts to implementation of
                            the contingency plan of <gloss target="#t_CINCNELM1">CINCNELM</gloss>,
                            which provides for military action in somewhat general terms. The Joint

                            improve military contingency plans if the political guidance to deal

                        <item>In view of the variety of possible crises in Iran, and in order to

                                <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            believe that U.S. policy should be supported by the provision of
                            additional feasible courses of action, political and military, for
                            dealing with emergencies in Iran.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>As indicated by the proposed memorandum the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            consider that any regime which would replace that of the Shah at this
                            time, whether communist or non-communist, would be less Western-oriented
                            and would therefore, represent a net loss to U.S. interests in the
                            Middle East. This assessment is based upon the absence of any
                            constructive pro-Western alternative regime, as recognized in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6010. It would, therefore, appear to be
                            in the best interest of the United States at present to support the
                            Shah’s government by all appropriate means. Nevertheless, recognizing
                            the possibility that events may result in the sudden removal of the Shah
                            from the scene, plans are required for supporting a pro-Western
                            successor, such as a regency, or a carefully selected friendly

                    </list>
                    <p>In 1955 under the “Atoms-for-Peace” program the United States undertook to
                        assist Israel with its atomic energy development program. Subsequently a one
                        megawatt research reactor was built with our aid at Nahal Rubin, near Tel
                        Aviv.</p>
                    <p>In the summer and early fall of 1960 rumors reached our Embassy at Tel Aviv
                        that the French were collaborating with the Israelis in the construction of
                        a large reactor at Dimona, near Beersheba, in the northern part of the Negev
                        desert. After our intelligence agencies had established on December 2 that a
                        significant atomic installation was in fact being built near Beersheba,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> on December 9
                        called in Israeli Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                        who undertook to obtain full information from his government. After a number
                        of exchanges, Prime Minister Ben-Gurion gave us categoric assurances
                        supported by appropriate public statements to the effect that Israel does
                        not have plans for developing nuclear weaponry. The French have also assured
                        us that their assistance is premised on Israel’s atomic energy program being
                        solely for peaceful purposes. Ben-Gurion had indicated that aside from
                        normal military precautions the reason for Israel’s extreme secrecy with
                        respect to the Dimona project was his fear and that of the foreign firms
                        assisting the project that the Arab states would boycott or take other
                        retaliatory measures against any firm or even country assisting the project.
                        There is considerable justification for this Israeli reasoning.</p>
                    <p>Our government’s concern was two-fold: a) pursuant to Congressional
                        legislation and firm executive branch policy the United States is opposed to
                        the proliferation of nuclear weapons capabilities; and b) Israel’s
                        acquisition of nuclear weapons would have grave repercussions in the Middle
                        East, not the least of which might be the probable stationing of Soviet
                        nuclear weapons on the soil of Israel’s embittered Arab neighbors.</p>
                    <p>The Israeli and French assurances which we have received appear to be
                        satisfactory, although several minor questions still require clarification.
                        In any case, the Department considers this not a single episode <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0070"/>but a continuing subject and it is the
                        intention of our intelligence agencies to maintain a continuing watch on
                        Israel as on other countries to assure that nuclear weapons capabilities are
                        not being proliferated. At the moment, we are encouraging the Israelis to
                        permit a qualified scientist from the United States or other friendly power
                        to visit the Dimona installation. Prime Minister Ben-Gurion has indicated
                        that this may be possible at an early date.</p>

                        minutes in the President’s office, during which the President excused
                        himself to see another visitor for a few minutes in an adjoining room. It is
                        my impression that the President permitted Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ROR1">Reid</persName> to develop the conversation as he
                        chose, expressing views of his own infrequently, if at all).</p>

                        maneuver on his own initiative, and would make reciprocal concessions in

                        secret basis, the participants communicating only through the most carefully
                        guarded channels. Any U.S. contribution would have to be on a basis of
                        direct contact with Ben-Gurion. He informed the President of Ben-Gurion’s

                        These are (1) cotton purchases, (2) arms supply, and (3) the Aswan Dam and
                        other economic aid. The West could reduce Soviet influence if it could

                        population centers are only four minutes from Damascus by supersonic

                        United States consideration of ballistic missiles for Israel and more
                        specific assurances of our willingness to help in case of invasion, as moves
                        that will contribute to stability in the Middle East. He told the President
                        of our offer, now outstanding, of early-warning equipment, which Israel is
                        studying. He suggested that we try to shorten delivery times for these

                            authorities. In 1960, new evidence indicated that Lavon’s alleged
                            authorization of the operation was a forgery and he asked for an
                            investigation. A committee of seven Cabinet members cleared him of

                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ROR1">Reid</persName> had replied <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> is the name most frequently

                        resumed United Nations. Having in mind the President’s interest in the
                        Dimona reactor<note n="1" xml:id="d7fn1">On February 6, while attending
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>’s staff meeting,

                            concern that the Israeli reactor might stimulate Egypt to press the
                            Soviet Union for aid in nuclear weapons development. According to the
                            memorandum of conversation, the President indicated that “this might
                            make it urgent for us to push a public announcement concerning the
                            peaceful uses of the Israeli project.” (Department of State, Secretary’s
                            Staff Meetings: Lot 66 D 147)</note> and the few words exchanged with
                        the Secretary February 2 before the luncheon for Loy Henderson, I arranged
                        to see <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> alone before our meeting
                        on the refugees. I told <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> that he
                        should not take what I was about to say as an official démarche: instead it
                        was talk between friends who were interested in US-Israeli relations
                        continuing on a smooth course undisturbed by doubts and suspicions.</p>
                    <p>I said that we fully accepted the statements of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> with regard to the peaceful uses
                        of the Dimona reactor. There was no question of doubting his word. We had,
                        however, noted with pleasure his offer to invite an American to the Dimona
                        site as soon as the publicity died down both in the United States and in
                        Israel—the timing to be <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s.
                        The affair of the Dimona reactor having arisen in somewhat dramatic
                        circumstances, the technicians associated with such matters maintain a keen
                        and continuing interest in the quiet visit suggested by <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>. There was interest at higher
                        levels as well: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ROR1">Reid</persName> had
                        encountered this in paying his calls around Washington. Moreover, the Arab
                        neighbors of Israel not infrequently raised the question of Dimona and its
                        potential use as a source of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Now Israel was in the throes of what appeared to be a political crisis.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had announced his
                        intention to take four weeks vacation. Also he was still the head of a
                        “caretaker government”. Israel had a <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0074"/>record of caretaker governments lasting for months. Could <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> advise me what to reply to the
                        question: “When do you think <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben
                            Gurion</persName> will invite someone to see the Dimona site?” Did he
                        think that such an invitation would have to be delayed because of the
                        internal political crisis?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> replied that: “In Israel no one
                        is thinking about anything else except the political crisis. The parties are
                        holding meetings which last for hours and hours. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> can think of nothing except the reputation of the
                        Mapai Party. I do not see how I could get to him or think that he would be
                        inclined to give an invitation at this time”.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> went on to say that in Israel
                        the story of the Dimona reactor is very simple: They are building a reactor
                        which will take some two years to complete. There is no plutonium. There is
                        plenty of time. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> has given
                        all the assurances that anyone could and additionally has explained that he
                        proposes to hand back the plutonium to the country supplying the uranium.
                        The Israelis, <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said, could not
                        conceive why there should be continuing interest in Dimona in the United
                        States or anywhere else. In good time, when there was something more to see,
                        the visit might be arranged but no Israeli, let alone <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>, could conceive why there was
                        such a hurry about it.</p>
                    <p>I said that I could understand the Israeli attitude being as he had described
                        it but the idea of the proliferation of nuclear weapons was absolutely
                        anathema to the United States and, although rightly or wrongly, the
                        suspicion of obtaining such a capability had fallen on Israel. Since the
                        United States and Israel are such close friends and since the offer of a
                        visit had been volunteered by Israel it seemed to me it was simply good
                        common sense for the visit to take place very quietly and without publicity
                        at an arranged date. The fact of such a visit by qualified experts would be
                        invaluable in allaying suspicions.</p>
                    <p>I reiterated that I was not giving a démarche. He and I were good friends and
                        I was simply “tipping him off” with regard to a continuation of United
                        States interest. I thought that when he paid his courtesy call upon the
                        Secretary some time in the next ten days it would be an excellent gesture if
                        he could at that time suggest a quiet visit by an American or some other
                        friendly expert. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ROR1">Reid</persName> had
                        indicated that this would not be at all difficult to arrange.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> thanked me for the “tip off” and
                        said that he would see what he could do. He was not sanguine of results
                        because of the Israeli internal political situation. He himself indicated
                        that he agreed with me that “getting the visit over with” would be a good
                            thing.<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">On February 11, <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> that he was authorized to tell

                    <p>As a flank attack on the Arab-Israel problem and in order to forestall future
                        conflict over Jordan River water resources, <persName>Eric
                            Johnston</persName> was sent as a Presidential emissary to the Near East
                        in 1953.<note n="1" xml:id="d8fn1">For documentation on the <persName>Eric

                        which the Jordan basin’s waters would be equitably divided among the
                        riparians. Although his initial reception was not favorable,
                            <persName>Johnston</persName> after two years of intensive negotiations
                        produced a plan which was with two minor exceptions agreeable to Arab and
                        Israeli technical experts. However, when considered by the Arab League at
                        the political level in the spring of 1955, <persName>Johnston</persName>’s
                        plan was not accepted. Arab resistance to the <persName>Johnston</persName>
                        plan <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0076"/>or any like it is based
                        primarily on the Arab conviction that any set of allocations which allows
                        Israel to irrigate the Negev desert will only encourage new Jewish
                        immigration thus inevitably generating pressures by Israel for territorial
                        expansion.</p>
                    <p>A fundamental principle of the <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan was that
                        all the reasonable needs of the Jordan basin must be accommodated. It was
                        privately understood by the negotiators that once allocations were made it
                        was each riparian’s own concern as to what it did with its share. Thus the
                        Kingdom of Jordan which is affected much more than any of its Arab neighbors
                        was allocated water for full development of the valley, even though much of
                        it is not now under cultivation. Jordan and Syria were to receive adequate
                        shares. The balance which went to Israel was of sufficient magnitude that

                        would be available for lifting over the central Palestine highland to the
                        coast and down to the Negev. There were also provisions for international
                        supervision.</p>
                    <p>Although <persName>Johnston</persName>’s efforts stalled, it was decided that
                        the hard-won progress which he had skillfully achieved should be preserved.
                        Accordingly, pursuant to a secret <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        decision in the spring of 1958, our government has through judicious use of
                        its assistance quietly been assuring that any water projects undertaken by
                        either Israel or the Kingdom of Jordan should be consistent with the
                            <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan. To this end, the United States has
                        thus far expended some $6,000,000 in financing the East Ghor irrigation
                        project in the Kingdom of Jordan, while some $30,000,000 has been made
                        available to assist in Israel’s extensive and far sighted national water
                        resources development program. We have written assurances respectively from
                        Jordan and Israel that they will abide by the terms of the
                            <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan, although Israel has made clear that
                        its assurances are conditioned on Arab acceptance of a mutually agreeable
                        plan within the reasonable future. This piecemeal but unadvertised execution
                        of the <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan is feasible largely because 85% of
                        Jordan’s needs can be met by water from the Yarmouk River, which is the
                        principal Jordan River tributary and which is almost entirely under
                        Jordanian control.</p>
                    <p>A key future date will occur in mid-1963 when Israel begins withdrawing water
                        from Lake Tiberias through a network now under construction which includes a
                        9-foot conduit for transporting water to the Negev. While the maximum
                        capacity of this diversion system will within 10 years be 450 MCM’s the
                        Israelis insist that their planned withdrawals need not exceed the
                            <persName>Johnston</persName> allocations. The Arabs, however, can be
                        expected to resist strongly to any diversion and the possibility of <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0077"/>hostilities cannot be ruled out. In
                        recent months there have been a number of indications that the Arab
                        governments are consorting as to what counter-measure might be taken,
                        including the diversion of the Jordan’s headwaters which rise in Syria and
                        Lebanon. Such diversion for spite purposes only would be almost
                        prohibitively expensive and only partially effective. It is doubtful if the
                        Arabs will in fact undertake it.</p>
                    <p>During the past two years, thought has frequently been given to a renewal of
                        our efforts to find a solution. Prospects for a change in Arab opposition
                        have, however, not been bright. <persName>Eric Johnston</persName>, who has
                        retained a keen personal interest in this matter, has on a number of
                        occasions spoken with Arab and Israeli leaders informally. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Eugene Black</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> has become interested, particularly
                        following the Bank’s historic success in solving the Indus waters
                            problem.<gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> representatives a few
                        months ago consulted with State Department representatives concerning the
                        details of the progress achieved by <persName>Johnston</persName> and have
                        indicated that at a suitable occasion the Bank might consider lending its
                        good offices.</p>
                    <p>Whether or not a new effort should be made depends primarily on what
                        decisions are taken with respect to approaching any of the various aspects
                        of the Arab-Israel dispute, e.g. refugee problem, boundaries, security
                        guarantees, compensation, Jerusalem, Arab boycott, Suez transit, etc. A
                        full-scale “package approach” having failed in 1955 (the top secret
                            <persName>Anderson</persName> mission), and in order not to inflame
                        emotions in the present relatively tranquil Near East, it has been the
                        Department’s inclination to follow a “piecemeal approach”, if a U.S.
                        initiative is determined to be necessary. From the standpoint of urgency,
                        either the refugee problem or the Jordan waters problem might be considered
                        as initial targets. Because of Congressional restiveness over appropriating
                        approximately $23,000,000 annually for the refugees and because this problem
                        is a perennial focal point for argument at the United Nations, the
                        Department’s preference has been to focus first attention to the refugee
                        problem. The Jordan waters problem, because it possesses some small rays of
                        hope, might also be considered as first focal point. However, in an
                        unadvertised piecemeal fashion of its own de facto progress is already being
                        made on the Jordan waters problem and this progress might be jeopardized if
                        a new Western initiative were undertaken. In any case, an approach to the
                        Jordan waters problem should be coordinated from a timing standpoint with
                        whatever other steps the United States Government may have in mind with
                        respect to the general Arab-Israel problem.</p>

                        would be continued, with primary attention areas of agreement such as
                        economic and cultural cooperation rather than points of difference. USG and
                        other world powers could not afford be hypersensitive political criticism in
                        Arab press. Small states like <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, on other
                        hand, had to react to such press criticism.</p>
                    <p>Secretary replied it was natural pay considerable attention points of
                        friction between states but we should not of course overlook opportunities
                        work quietly improve relations. There was great deal of progress which could
                        be achieved. We intended to do our share and hoped <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would also. Secretary recalled with appreciation <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>’s customary readiness talk over
                        problems and asked <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> convey his

                        anyone’s interest except Communists for Cold War to be exported to Congo.
                        Communists’ tactics were becoming more sophisticated and effective in
                        achieving penetration through non-military means. This development posed
                        great threat to countries like US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>

                        which would only create trouble. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        expressed hope both West and Arabs could remain quiet and work to build up
                        relations. This connection, he noted Arabs frankly suspicious new
                        Administration due coincidence Truman administration and establishment
                        Israel. However, he had sought explain to his government differences between
                        “Trumanism” and new administration which he felt not unfriendly Arabs. It
                        would nevertheless be important neutralize pressure groups here and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would take similar action against
                        unfriendly elements there. Secretary noted quiet diplomacy useful improving
                        relations between governments but not much help calming public suspicions.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> opined that, if US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations could be placed on basis mutual

                    <p>Secretary said he wished emphasize that we had been concerned at reports of
                        Israel’s nuclear development and intended to follow this question closely.
                        We had received assurances from both Israel and France. These had made clear
                        that reactor was for peaceful purposes and not for weapons production. USG
                        opposed spread nuclear weapons and would make every effort remain currently
                        informed re status and nature Israeli development this field. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> inquired what practical measures might

                    <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> said that our policies on
                        the Middle East have been close in recent years and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> wanted to insure that they are aligned in
                        the <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0081"/>future. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> hoped that we would continue to talk over
                        the various problems and would act together. Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> was hopeful that the present calm in the area, although
                        admittedly uneasy, would continue. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> now seemed to be looking in the direction of Africa
                        and this was perhaps a hopeful sign. The basic cause of unrest, however,
                        continued to be the Arab-Israeli problem. Very little progress has been made
                        there. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> wondered if we had anything
                        new, i.e., where we might go and how to get there, with respect to this
                        problem and also the problem of Arab refugees.</p>
                    <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> said a new problem had
                        recently arisen—the Israeli reactor—and he wondered if there was anything
                        more that could or should be done to impress upon the Israelis how serious
                        this matter was, and how necessary it was to obtain suitable safeguards. He
                        said that he shuddered to think what the Arab reaction would be if they
                        became convinced that the reactor was being used for weapons production. He
                        asked for our views with respect to the general situation, the Arab-Israeli
                        question, and the particular problem of the atomic reactor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that we shared <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> apprehension about the reactor. The
                        Norwegians were also concerned and were asking for more information before
                        providing additional heavy water to the Israelis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> said that we were in general
                        agreement here with the British. We intend to keep an eye on the situation
                        and to hold the Israelis to their stated intentions not to produce weapons.
                        However, there are still a few loose ends. We feel that it would be useful
                        to have observers from friendly powers visit the new Israeli reactor. Israel
                        should feel that such inspection is also in its interests. Ben-Gurion’s
                        present disposition seems to be to let the publicity die down somewhat
                        before taking further action; he, of course, has been preoccupied with his
                        domestic situation in recent weeks. The French have also expressed concern
                        over the possibility of weapons being produced by Israel.</p>
                    <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> asked if inspection is
                        provided for in the atomic agreements with Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> replied that it was in our agreement
                        with the Israelis with respect to the small reactor we are providing. <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards applied only to assistance
                        provided by the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWCJ1">Burdett</persName> stated that the Norwegian
                        agreement provided for inspection, although again not the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> system of safeguards. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> noted that Ben-Gurion asks why Israel
                        should accept safeguards when India and others refuse. Ben-Gurion, moreover,
                        fears that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection would mean
                        Russian involvement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wiggin observed that the problem was not only one of not producing
                        weapons but also of convincing the Arabs that weapons were not being
                        produced. The latter was probably the most difficult. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> concurred. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that certainly the main problem
                        was to convince others. To do this we ourselves must know what is going on.
                            <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0082"/>Neither the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> nor the U.S. could permit atomic weapons to
                        be produced in this area.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the general situation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> said that the Arab-Israeli dispute, of course, goes
                        back more than a decade and so far has defied solution. A major effort was
                        made in 1955 to resolve the problem, but it failed mainly because neither
                        side was prepared to make the necessary concessions. Then there was Suez. In
                        recent years the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> have
                        worked toward a normalization of relations with the area. The new
                        Administration has been preoccupied with matters of more urgent concern,
                        such as the Congo and Laos, and has, therefore, not had opportunity as yet
                        to complete its study of the Arab-Israeli problem. However, it certainly was
                        appreciative of the present tranquility. At the moment we have no specific
                        proposals or initiatives in mind and in any event would be in touch with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> should any major move be
                        planned.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> said that thinking at the
                        bureau level tends to favor a “piecemeal” approach, rather than the
                        “package” approach which failed in 1955. The annual presentation to Congress
                        on refugee aid and the annual General Assembly hassle with respect to <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> argue for early action with respect to
                        the refugee problem. Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName>
                        observed that the refugee problem is not merely technical but is also a
                        political problem. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> felt that the
                        only possible solution on refugees would be in the framework of a wider
                        political agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName>
                        observed that the problem would become more manageable if the Israelis could
                        agree to the principle of repatriation. While there was no indication of a
                        change in Israeli opposition, it might be possible if they could be assured
                        that accepting the principle would not constitute a danger to either
                        Israel’s security or economy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> asked if the British have
                        anything new on <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName>’s thinking with respect
                        to the Arab-Israel issue. Mr. Weir said that he understood <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName> stated recently that he had no
                        plans with respect to this problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GDA1">Greenhill</persName> asked if we favored
                        widening the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> replied that although we opposed such
                        a move last fall, we were not categoric about it. It would all depend on
                        whether such enlargement would serve a useful purpose. There are some recent
                        indications that the Arabs themselves may no longer be so anxious to enlarge
                        the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>. In recent calls Arab Ambassadors
                        have stressed that they think the whole question should be “put in the
                        refrigerator.”</p>
                    <p>With regard to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> said that we were pleased with recent
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> steps to improve its relations. Lord
                            <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> was well aware that the resumption of
                        diplomatic relations has not changed <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, but it has opened up a listening post. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> said that we too have no illusions
                        with respect to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> and U.S. policies <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0083"/>are parallel here; we favor neither embracement nor
                        hostility. In his view, forces in the area have more effect on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> than Western pressure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> asked if there were any
                        special implications to the British query on the Arab-Israeli dispute. Lord
                            <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> replied in the negative,
                        saying that they were simply curious. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> asked if the British would advise that no initiatives
                        be taken. Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> said that he did
                        not think so. They liked the present calm but the fact was that the causes
                        of friction were still there. If some useful “medicine” could be applied
                        which would “retard” the “disease” that, of course, should be done.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Weir wondered how much of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
                        cooperation with the Soviets was explicit arrangement and how much simply
                        coincidental. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> said that
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> appears to be driven
                        primarily by a dominating ambition with respect to the three circles
                        mentioned in his book, i.e., the Arab World, the Moslem World, and Africa.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> observed that you might
                        call it opportunistic neo-colonialism.</p>
                    <p>In Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName>’s view there seemed to be
                        a slight pulling back in the Congo by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> after Casablanca. The latter may have provided a
                        means of getting out of what he considered an unhappy situation in the
                        Congo. He may also have come to realize how much he was being used by the
                        Soviets. Another factor is his present difficult financial situation. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> emphasized, however, that
                        this recent slight shift in <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
                        policy could be only tactical. It could be that with the latest developments
                        in the Congo (Lumumba’s death) the Russians will use him more than ever.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> asked if the British had any
                        views on the Jordan waters problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GDA1">Greenhill</persName> replied that they were of the opinion that the
                            <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan was more or less a dead letter, i.e.,
                        it was not much of a starter. London, however, has not made any concrete
                        proposals. He wondered if there was any problem here with respect to timing.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> replied that the issue may
                        come to a head in 1963 when Israel starts diverting the Jordan. He noted
                        that a hill in front of the pumping station provides some protection. Mr.
                        Weir observed that the Syrians could probably lob shells over the hill.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> said that he could not
                        agree, that the <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan was a dead letter. The
                        progress made on the technical level should be preserved and used. It was
                        true that the Israeli structures have a maximum capacity higher than that
                        envisaged in the <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan, but the Israelis say
                        they are willing to abide by the terms of the plan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GDA1">Greenhill</persName> asked if there seemed to
                        be continued pressure for Jewish immigration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> replied that most of the sources seem
                        to be drying up. In fact, manpower was becoming a problem in Israel.</p>

                            See Supplement, the compilation on Jordan.</note> As for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> share, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had been promised last fall that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> would try to do a little more. He was now
                        happy to say that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> would increase its
                        budget aid by one million dollars during the next fiscal year. The increase
                        would be made available at the beginning of the year, that is, on April 1. A
                        letter has gone to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> on
                        this.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that we were happy the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> was increasing its aid. We had
                        pressed the Germans on this but so far without success. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> increase reduces our share of the Jordan budget load from
                        85% to 83%. This is, of course, welcomed but we had hoped that our
                        percentage could be reduced from the present 85% to 70%. The Germans have
                        indicated that they might provide some project aid but budgetary aid is the
                        main problem.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Iran</hi>—Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName>
                        said that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> attaches great importance
                        to Iran. He was afraid that there will continue to be trouble there. The
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> was now thinking seriously about the
                        long-term problem, i.e., the prospects of the Shah surviving, whether or not
                        to give advice, etc. The views of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>
                        Ambassador to Iran have been requested, and it was anticipated that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> will want to discuss the problem
                        with us in more detail in March or April. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that we were always ready to discuss Iran. He
                        added that Ambassador Thompson in recent talks put his finger on Iran as a
                        very special problem.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss></hi>—Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> hopes that the U.S. will continue to support this
                        organization. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> referred to
                        the Secretary’s expected attendance at the next <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> meeting as an indication that the new Administration
                        plans to give full support to these organizations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that we agreed fully with the

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Persian Gulf</hi>—Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> said that he was sure that the U.S. knew how important
                        it was for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> to remain in the Persian
                        Gulf. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> recognized that maintaining
                        its position there opened it and others up to charges of imperialism.
                        Nevertheless, they feel it is worthwhile not only because of the oil but
                        also because the rulers and people of the Sheikdoms prefer the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> presence to a vacuum. The latter would be
                        rapidly filled by Communist-inclined elements. At the same time the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> recognizes its responsibilities and is
                        trying to move these areas toward a more democratic way of life, although
                        this is admittedly a slow <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0085"/>process.
                        The <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> hopes that the U.S. will be
                        understanding and will give the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> its

                            declassified</hi>] in Tehran have emphasized in recent reports the
                        Shah’s anxiety lest the new Administration change United States policy of
                        support for Iran and for the Shah. We have also been informed of an upsurge
                        in the Shah’s concern over the level of United States’ military assistance
                        to Iran.</p>
                    <p>Despite our Ambassador’s best efforts to dissuade him, the Shah has sent the
                        chief of Iran’s Security and Intelligence Organization, General <persName corresp="#p_BGT1">Teimur Bakhtiar</persName>, to the United States with
                        instructions to call on the principal officials of the United States
                        Government and on other prominent Americans to discover what changes, if
                        any, in United States policy may be forthcoming under the new
                        Administration. The Shah has also addressed a letter to the President which
                        he desires to be presented personally to the President by the Shah’s
                        representative. I am presently arranging <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0086"/>for calls by <persName corresp="#p_BGT1">General

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> remarked that the
                        current quiescent state of affairs in the Middle East has prevailed for four
                        years. Since 1958, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s subversive
                        efforts had been effectively checked in Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq. The
                        recent Baghdad meeting of the Arab League had revealed the “roll-back” of
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-inspired, nationalist trends among
                        the <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0087"/>Arabs, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> not having been able to dominate in
                        the old manner. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> said
                        that perhaps the “roll-back” had “rolled” <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> right down to the Congo, the Ambassador said the
                        suggestion was not particularly far-fetched, that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is a restless spirit and when
                        checked in one area is obliged to seek an outlet elsewhere and Africa is now
                        a major target.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that despite the
                        prevailing calm there are very important elements for anxiety in the Middle
                        East, in general, and specifically for Israel. Of these, rearmament is the
                        most sensitive. Egypt has been setting the pace since 1955, when it first
                        began to acquire Soviet arms. Since the end of 1957 it has moved toward the
                        acquisition of the Soviets’ <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19, which by
                        a large margin is a better plane than anything the Israelis have, and
                        capable of delivering air-to-air missiles. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> asked what type of missile,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that he is not
                        informed on this point, but it is a certainty the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19 would carry a missile because of its tremendous speed
                        and high flight ceiling. It will out-match the Israelis’ best jet, the
                        French “Super-Mystere”, and, accordingly, the Israelis are now dealing with
                        the French for the “Mirage”, which, however, cannot be delivered for another
                        eighteen months.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said Israel has convincing evidence that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> already has the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19’s and that some may also have been delivered to Iraq.
                        Furthermore, Soviet training crews have arrived in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Asked if Israel believes the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s
                        fighter-pilots are better qualified than formerly, the Ambassador said that
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has gone to tremendous and
                        successful efforts to raise the quality of its training and inter-services
                        coordination. The Egyptians had learned the most important lesson to be
                        gained from their experiences in the Sinai, and have addressed considerable
                        effort to improving the calibre of their officer corps.</p>
                    <p>Egypt’s improved military posture has underscored a question, broached with
                        the State Department over a year ago, of Israel’s ability to meet a sudden
                        air attack. The Ambassador described Israel as a small country with no
                        defense in depth, a narrow ten-mile waist, and greatest dimensions no more
                        than 50 miles by 350 miles. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has
                        twenty-six airfields in the two provinces, and by virtue of geographic
                        advantage can shuttle back and forth over Israel, which has only three
                        operational fields plus a fourth civilian airfield which could be pressed
                        into use in a crisis. All this means that Israel’s jet fighter capacity
                        could be knocked out immediately and the country’s communications system
                        destroyed, thus creating great difficulties for man power mobilization,
                        which depends on quick communications with a large reserve to augment a
                        small <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0088"/>standing army. Anticipating the
                        vulnerability that is now rapidly developing, Israel a year ago asked the
                        United States for anti-aircraft missiles.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> asked the details of the
                        Israel brief presented to the United States Government in support of its
                        request. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> replied
                        that Israel wanted the “Hawk”, which he described as a purely defensive
                        ground-to-air missile which cannot be used offensively but is ideally
                        adapted to the purpose of defending Israel’s airfields. The United States
                        had expressed reluctance, according to the Ambassador, to introduce a
                        missile of any kind into the area, but had assured the Israelis that if new
                        factors emerged this decision could be reconsidered.</p>
                    <p>The situation is now developing as Israel feared, according to the
                        Ambassador. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19. Israel does not fear an immediate
                        strike, but in its view must prepare for 1962 when the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will be ready to employ its new competence
                        against Israel, if Israel by that time does not have a deterrent. The
                        Israelis would like to begin preparing for this critical period by sending
                        personnel to the United States for training in the operation and maintenance
                        of the “Hawk”. At the time the request was made, the Israelis had been
                        informed that training facilities were “mortgaged” for some time to come,
                        but if it were possible to begin training now, Israel would be in a state of
                        preparedness from a man power standpoint, if at the time of maximum danger,
                        the United States consented to provide the “Hawk”.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> asked the Ambassador how the
                        latter would describe the present United States position.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that the United
                        States agreed Israel has a legitimate requirement for deterrent capacity;
                        Israel’s assessment that the situation is moving into a state of arms
                        imbalance in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s favor had not been
                        contested in Washington. However, the United States did not wish to
                        introduce offensive equipment in the Middle East and advised Israel to seek
                        its major requirements from “traditional sources”, principally the French
                        and the British. The United States had agreed to sell early-warning
                        equipment on three-year credit terms and an Israel electronics team recently
                        completed a tour of United States installations and factories to become
                        acquainted with the equipment. It has now returned to Israel, which is in
                        the process of deciding whether or not to place an order.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                        continued, the United States agreed to take into consideration the
                        additional burden placed on the economy by Israel’s defense requirements.
                        While unwilling to finance such procurement directly, the Israelis had been
                        informed, the United States would study the impact of arms expenditures in
                        considering Israel’s applications in the several categories of aid.</p>
                    <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0089"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> asked the Ambassador if he
                        was reopening the request for missiles or merely signalling the fact that
                        such a request was in the offing.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said he was not under
                        instruction, even to signal the possibility of such a request, but that
                        Israel is now reviewing its circumstances in the light of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s acquisition of the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> mentioned briefly the
                        possibility of regional disarmament, which might be easily achieved in the
                        Near East by agreement among the big powers, inasmuch as all countries there
                        are obliged to look to the major powers for “deadly stuff”. Because of the
                        volatility of the area the introduction of each new device in the offensive
                        field carries with it great changes.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Israel’s Atomic Reactor</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> asked the Ambassador if
                        Israel’s construction of an atomic reactor does not represent the
                        introduction of just the sort of sensitive factor he was speaking about.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that Israel has
                        no intention of manufacturing the bomb and the reactor itself is three or
                        four years away from operation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> pressed the point of the
                        development’s impact on Arab opinion. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> replied that the manner of its revelation to the
                        world had created unnecessary tension. It had “spilled out” in an
                        unfortunate manner. Asked for details, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said it had been leaked out quite unnecessarily, in
                        truth had had an adverse effect in the area, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> threatening to mobilize four million men, all of
                        which had been very unpleasant for Israel.</p>
                    <p>He said the sensational speculation was without foundation, and, as he had
                        indicated to the Secretary of State, Israel has no intention for uses other
                        than peaceful. A visit to the reactor, in which this Government had
                        expressed an interest, probably would be arranged by Ben-Gurion if he were
                        restored to power in the wake of the present Cabinet crisis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>’s suggestion that he had no doubt
                        Ben-Gurion, who might be regarded as the Schumann-Heink of the political
                        world, will inevitably return to Israel’s premiership was received
                        good-naturedly by the Israelis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> pressed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> on the question of the legitimacy of Arab concern
                        with the atomic energy development.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> deprecated its
                        importance. He said it is a small reactor, and if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> were to announce a similar development,
                        even one much larger, to be dedicated to the same purposes intended for
                        Israel’s, his Government would not be concerned.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> remarked on the magnitude of
                        the expenditure which must be represented by such a development, but
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that it is
                        modest in scope, to be devoted exclusively to scientific experimentation <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0090"/>and the training of a corps of
                        scientists who, fifteen years from now, would be an important asset, if by
                        that time the great powers had made a “break-through” to establish peaceful
                        uses on an economic basis.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> suggested again that
                        the United States would be well-advised to consider disarmament for the
                        area. A subsidiary benefit would be halting the flow of Communist arms to
                        Africa. He said Israel intelligence reveals that Communist elements in
                        African countries are receiving arms, not directly from the Soviets but with
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> as an entrepot.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Jordan River Problem</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> asked the Ambassador how he
                        assessed the Jordan Valley problem and the possibility of outside help for
                        its solution.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> reminded Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> of the <persName>Eric
                            Johnston</persName> mission’s failure to achieve agreement among the
                        several riparian states for an equitable division of the waters, the Plan
                        having been agreed upon by the technicians but failing when submitted to the
                        Arab governments. Since then, he said, the Department of State had agreed to
                        a modus operandi under which it would assist separate but parallel
                        developments in Israel and Jordan which would remain within the limits
                        established by the <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> asked if this approach
                        is feasible to the ultimate, full realization of the
                            <persName>Johnston</persName> concept, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> said that the imponderable is the question of
                        Jordanian ability, from the standpoint of its relations with its neighbors,
                        to view with equanimity Israel’s taking from the Jordan system its share of
                        the water, probably starting in late 1962 or 1963.</p>
                    <p>He described the essence of the Plan as Israel’s use of the Jordan River and
                        Jordan’s use of the Yarmuk.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> indicated that the
                        degree of political danger surrounding the start of Israel’s diversion of
                        the river would depend on Jordanian circumstances at the time. There would
                        be no explosion if Jordan by that time were in a stable, relatively viable
                        position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> asked if there is
                        covert communication between Israel and Jordan on such problems and was
                        informed that there is very little, so little, in fact, as to amount to “no
                        more than telepathy”.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador described Jordan’s economic development as important not only
                        in the interests of the Jordanians’ welfare but because Jordan’s continued
                        existence is essential to the stability of the entire area, and for that
                        reason deserves any infusion of strength that the West is able to
                        supply.</p>

                    <p>Discussion of Jordan’s contribution to the stability of the area led directly
                        to a statement volunteered by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> that Israel has interested itself in and has
                        discussed with the Department Jordan’s economic development and the
                        possibility of coupling it with efforts to move forward with the Arab
                        refugee problem. He described Jordan as an excellent proving ground for
                        efforts to disperse the refugees because there are no political or civil
                        barriers between the refugees and the rest of the populace. If a pool of
                        100,000 jobs could be created in Jordan, it would draw off enough of the
                        refugees to begin a dispersal from the camps and the disappearance of the
                        problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> asked the
                        Ambassador if he believes the Arabs are any more willing than before to
                        consider solutions, not involving a return to Israel. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> replied that he finds hope in the
                        area’s heightened interest in economic development, which might make things
                        possible now that were out of the question some years ago. The whole area is
                        development-minded.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> suggested that an intelligent
                        development of the Yarmuk would provide 40,000 of the 100,000 jobs mentioned
                        by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>.</p>
                    <p>After an exchange of assurances that the preservation of the present relative
                        tranquillity of the area is much to be desired, the Israelis departed with
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>’s assurances that he would
                        be glad to receive them at any time. He remarked, however, that problems of
                        the kind discussed should in the first instance be approached through the
                        State Department.</p>

                    <p>On February 19, 1961, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> issued an executive order abolishing the Operations
                        Coordinating Board (<gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>), which, during the
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration, had
                        provided a mechanism for coordinated interdepartmental implementation of
                        national security policies adopted by the National Security Council and
                        approved by the President. The President’s statement is printed in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:

                        pages 104–105. With this action the President transferred to the Department
                        of State a number of <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> responsibilities
                        including the preparation of papers delineating <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0092"/>regional and country policies. Between 1961 and 1963, the
                        Policy Planning Council coordinated preparation of these papers that were
                        drafted in the relevant geographic bureau and sent for comment to the

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGT1">General Bakhtiar</persName> said that his mission
                        was to acquaint the new Administration with the situation in Iran and the
                        very heavy burden which fell on Iran by virtue of its geographic position,
                        its faithful efforts to enhance free world defense, and its limited
                        resources. Iran must defend itself and the Middle East by ensuring both an
                        adequate military defense establishment and a rising standard of living for
                        its people. It cannot accomplish both these tasks at once without assistance
                        from the United States.</p>
                    <p>The General said that the Iranian public could not understand why, if <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> was a worthwhile organization, the
                        United States did not join it. Iran was bound by its <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> commitments to try to build a defense
                            <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0093"/>force, for regional purposes,
                        which would be far larger than would be required for internal security
                        purposes. Iran expends a third of its budget for military purposes, which
                        does not leave enough, even with foreign assistance, to carry on economic
                        development at an adequate pace. <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                        goals are set by a Military Committee which includes United States
                        officers.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGT1">General Bakhtiar</persName> remarked that
                        countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, which represent a threat to Iran, are
                        receiving extensive economic assistance both from the United States and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>, and that they are being
                        supplied with Soviet military equipment, particularly aircraft, far in
                        advance of what the United States supplies to Iran. In order to be able to
                        meet this threat, Iran should receive equivalent weapons.</p>
                    <p>The General said that one way for the United States to assist Iran would be
                        to take steps to increase Iran’s oil income, at the expense, if necessary,
                        of countries like Iraq and Kuwait which do not contribute to regional
                        defense.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary, in reply, said that the United States, in the context of its
                        historic and continuing interest in the freedom and integrity of Iran,
                        believed that Iran should have an adequate and efficient Army. Military
                        planners, including those in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and in
                        the United States military establishment, set up desirable goals which are
                        then adjusted downward to the resources available for their
                        implementation.</p>
                    <p>The United States, said the Secretary, believes that <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> is an important and useful
                        organization. Despite the Secretary’s feeling that, in general, Foreign
                        Ministers do too much travelling, he attaches sufficient importance to
                            <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> that he intends to attend the
                        April Council meetings in Ankara.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the United States does not feel that Iran faces any
                        threat of military force other than on her northern border. Should Iran ever
                        be subject to hostile action by the Soviet Union, the United States, as well
                        as other Free World nations, would view such action with the utmost gravity.
                        Iran can be certain that she would never have to face such a threat
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that in his opinion, free nations must never lose sight of
                        the fact that an effective defense against communism must rest not only on
                        military strength but on the positive loyalty and confidence which depend on
                        social and economic progress. The United States hoped to help Iran as
                        necessary over the difficult phases of this advance.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he could not, unfortunately, make any definite
                        statements at this time as to the nature or levels of United States aid to
                        any nation during the coming fiscal year. He explained that the
                        administration was only one month old and that its foreign aid program was
                        still being put together. As the General knew, the President had <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0094"/>been ccupied with measures to deal with
                        problems of the American economy, which were of course of importance to all
                        the Free World. It should be possible before long to make a more precise
                        statement with regard to United States foreign aid levels, but it could not
                        be done at the present moment. The Secretary expressed his embarrassment
                        over the unfortunate timing whereby these factors induced uncertainty and
                        inconvenience in Iranian budgetary actions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary told the General that if he had come to “take the temperature”
                        of the new Administration with regard to its attitude toward Iran, he could
                        rest assured that the United States would take a lively and positive
                        interest in Iran’s progress, and that it would continue to cooperate with
                        Iran and to help as it could within the tradition of cooperation between the
                        two countries.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ZA5">Zahedi</persName> then expressed his
                        appreciation for the help which Iran had been given in the past, and
                        expressed his convictions that United States aid in the future would
                        continue to be fruitful and positive.<note n="1" xml:id="d14fn1"><persName corresp="#p_BGT1">Bakhtiar</persName> also discussed increased

                            being given equal treatment with Turkey and that the Shah would leave
                                <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> unless he was led to believe
                            that increased United States aid would make it worthwhile for him to
                            remain. He termed his discussion with <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> on these matters as “not satisfactory.”

                        there follows Department comment pertinent to some of the points raised by

                                    suggested that the Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19, which he believes the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is now receiving, is greatly superior to the
                                    best fighter plane the Israelis now have, the French
                                    “Super-Mystere”.</p>
                                <p>(It is the Department’s understanding that the “Super-Mystere” is
                                    virtually on a par with the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19, although the latter may have points of
                                    superiority under some circumstances. According to the
                                    Department’s information, the French “Mirage”, which the French
                                    have agreed to supply to the Israelis, is much superior to the
                                        <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19. A performance table

                                    that the United States Government declined to furnish a
                                    ground-to-air missile, the “Hawk”, but assured the Israelis that
                                    the decision could be reconsidered if new factors emerged.</p>
                                <p>(The United States declined because of its reluctance to have a
                                    weapon of this sophistication introduced into the Middle East,
                                    inevitably producing a dangerous new element in the never-ending
                                    pursuit of better arms. United States “willingness” to
                                    reconsider was expressed by heavily pressed United States
                                    officials, who stressed that the inference was not to be drawn
                                    that reconsideration would change the United States position. A

                            <item><p>The Israel Ambassador said the United States, although unable
                                    to finance Israel’s arms procurement, would take it into account
                                    in considering Israel’s applications in the several categories
                                    of aid.</p>
                                <p>(The Department’s position has consistently been that Israel’s
                                    applications for aid and loans must be justified on economic
                                    grounds. We have carefully refrained from affirming the
                                    Israelis’ proposition that an expanded Israel military burden
                                    will produce an expanded program of United States aid and loans
                                    to Israel. It has been stressed that a country’s security
                                    expenditures are only one facet of many studied in determining
                                    its eligibility for assistance.)</p></item>

                                    expressed unhappiness with the manner in which Israel’s nuclear
                                    development came to the public’s attention.</p>
                                <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0096"/>
                                <p>(A project of such significance was bound to become public
                                    knowledge sooner or later. It had already been under way for
                                    perhaps two years. Our Government endeavored to keep the matter
                                    secret while waiting for Israel’s official explanation, but was
                                    forced to comment when the story “broke” in rather sensational
                                    terms in the British press. There is considerable justification
                                    for the Israel contention that they were compelled to maintain
                                    tight security for fear of Arab harassment of the project. A
                                    number of Congressional leaders remain unhappy that the Israelis
                                    kept a development of this importance secret from the United
                                    States in a period when they were operating on a basis of
                                    special confidence to press highly sensitive requests for arms
                                    and economic assistance.)</p></item>

                                        Gazit</persName>, suggested that in its essentials the
                                        <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan for the Jordan Valley
                                    could be reduced to allotting the Jordan River to Israel and its
                                    tributary, the Yarmuk, to the Kingdom of Jordan.</p>
                                <p>(According to the <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan, Israel
                                    would be obliged to deliver to the Kingdom of Jordan 100 million
                                    cubic meters of Jordan River water, about 15–20% of the
                                    utilizable total flow of the Jordan River. Furthermore, the
                                    Kingdom of Jordan would realize its full expectations from the
                                    Yarmuk only if some of that tributary’s spring flood waters were
                                    trapped and stored in Lake Tiberias, which is completely under
                                    Israel’s control. It was because of such obligations between the
                                    riparians that the <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan provided
                                    for an international water master. While the Kingdom of Jordan
                                    might realize up to 85% of its needs from the Yarmuk, providing

                                    share, as calculated under the <persName>Johnston</persName>
                                    Plan, can be fully realized only by physical concessions from

                        <item>Authority in Iran is concentrated almost exclusively in the hands of
                            the Shah, whose rule rests primarily on the loyalty of the military and
                            security forces. Despite the attention which has been lavished on the
                            armed forces, their capabilities remain low. The growing political
                            unrest of the urban middle class is being manifested more openly than in
                            previous years against the Shah’s blatant rigging of elections for the
                            Majlis (lower house of parliament). Although the Tudeh (Iranian
                            Communist Party) remains neutralized, non-Communist civilian politicians
                            show little promise of effective leadership. (Paras. 6–15)</item>

                        <item>While a political upheaval could take place in Iran at any time, on
                            the whole, we believe the odds are against such a development in the
                            next year or so. However, profound political and social change in one
                            form or another is virtually inevitable. The nature of Iranian politics
                            and the character of the Shah make it unlikely that this change will be
                            evolutionary. Possibilities for sudden change lie in a move against the
                            Shah by some of his senior military commanders or an alliance between
                            younger military officers and nationalist civilians. At present, neither
                            eventuality would appear likely to result in improved stability in Iran.

                        <item>Iran’s economic prospects for the next year or two are not bright:
                            inflation will probably continue; balance of payments deficits will keep
                            foreign exchange reserves low and force foreign borrowing. Nevertheless
                            the new stabilization program holds some promise for putting <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0098"/>Iran’s finances in order and for
                            developing responsible and competent economic management. The major
                            determining factor of Iran’s long-term economic success probably will be
                            the willingness of the Shah to support those who are seeking to
                            modernize the country’s economic institutions and practices. In view of
                            the unpalatable political choices involved, and the Shah’s past
                            performances, we believe the Shah is unlikely to take any vigorous
                            action to promote economic reforms. (Paras. 22–30)</item>

                        <item>Assuming that the Shah remains in power and continues to enjoy US
                            support, we foresee little change in Iran’s international position in
                            the next year or so. A continuing problem for the US will probably be
                            how to give the Shah sufficient support to preserve his present
                            pro-Western policy without encouraging excessive demands for aid.

                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>For the short run, we think the odds are against a break in the
                            stalemate in Iran’s relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which has persisted for the past two years. Over the
                            longer term, it is possible that Iran and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may achieve some kind of modus vivendi, which might
                            eventually be broadened to include Soviet economic and perhaps even
                            military aid for Iran. The chances of such an accommodation would be
                            much greater should the Shah become convinced that the US was
                            withdrawing or significantly reducing its support for him. (Paras.

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGT1">General Bakhtiar</persName> called on the
                        President by appointment at 3:00 p.m., March 1, 1961, to present a letter
                        from the Shah of Iran.<note n="1" xml:id="d17fn1">Not printed. On March 17,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> forwarded to <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> a proposed reply to the Shah’s
                            letter. (Department of State, Central Files, 611.88/3–1761) The
                            President’s response to the Shah was transmitted to the Embassy in
                            Tehran in telegram 1101, March 24. (Ibid., 788.5–<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/3–2461) For text, see Supplement, the compilation on
                            Iran.</note></p>
                    <p>The President, after reading the letter, commenting on the military-economic
                        foreign aid aspects thereof, stated his Administration had the matter of aid
                        currently under study. The President envisaged by the end of March the
                        recommendations would probably be completed and submitted. It was his
                        understanding the Iranian fiscal year began March 22 and, consequently, a
                        period would elapse before the Shah would be informed about the questions
                        raised in His Majesty’s letter. The President hoped, however, the Shah would
                        understand the difficulties facing his new Administration and the Government
                        of Iran would not experience an undue hardship on this account.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked how the General would prefer that he answer the
                        letter. Since <persName corresp="#p_BGT1">General Bakhtiar</persName> was
                        returning to Tehran March 2, it was agreed that the reply would be
                        transmitted through the Department and given to the Shah by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_WET1">Wailes</persName>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGT1">General Bakhtiar</persName> then underlined the
                        financial difficulties facing Iran, particularly the problem of
                        simultaneously financing economic development and maintaining adequate
                        security forces. The General reiterated that it was important Iran be
                        informed as soon as possible about the level of assistance for the coming
                        year. The General remarked the Iranian Government believed that the
                        Consortium should increase its off-take of oil to augment Iran’s income. He
                        drew as an analogy the Kuwait oil picture. In Kuwait the annual income from
                        oil is $400 million which on a per capita basis gives each Kuwaiti $2,000;
                        each Iranian, dividing the annual income from oil of $250 million, would
                        receive only $12. The President asked which American companies were
                        participating in Iranian oil development. He emphasized commercial matters
                        were usually settled in the open market, adding he was sure the General was
                        aware the United States Government ordinarily did not advise American
                        private business on how to run its affairs. He said, however, he would “look
                        into the matter”.<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">Subsequently, on March 16, a
                            memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DRA1">Dungan</persName> conveyed the
                            Department of State position that Iran had repeatedly in the past raised
                            the off-take issue, that the President’s response was fully in accord
                            with the previous U.S. position on the subject, and that a further
                            response was not required. (Department of State, Central Files,
                            880.2553/3–1661)</note></p>
                    <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0100"/>
                    <p>The President stated he was acutely aware of the problem facing Iran, like
                        other countries, where the tasks of maintaining internal security and armed
                        forces against outside aggression, in addition to striving to achieve a
                        democratic form of government and economic development, were monumental. The
                        United States is aware of the aspirations of the peoples of Iran and
                        elsewhere to achieve these goals and we wish to associate ourselves with the
                        hopes of these peoples. The United States continues to be interested and
                        concerned in Iran’s problems, as we are also aware of the Iranian peoples’
                        wish to be free from the threat of aggression.</p>
                    <p>As evidence of his concern, the President requested <persName corresp="#p_BGT1">General Bakhtiar</persName> to reassure the Shah of
                        our continued interest, adding he would give His Majesty’s letter his
                        considered attention. Further, the President added the General might tell
                        His Imperial Majesty that he would be pleased to be in communication with
                        him. Furthermore, as evidence of our interest, the President informed the
                        General that he was sending Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> to Iran following his trip to Europe. Iran will be
                        the only Asian country Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> will visit and the President remarked that he was
                        convinced that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>’s
                        visit, like the General’s, would be helpful to both parties.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGT1">General Bakhtiar</persName> then stated that
                        Iran, in addition to having the Soviets on its borders, has two other
                        neighbors—Iraq and Afghanistan—which are receiving more modern weapons
                        (especially aircraft) than Iran is receiving. The President remarked that he
                        was not aware of any serious problem facing Iran from the direction of Iraq
                        and Afghanistan. He asked about Iran’s relations with its two neighbors. In
                        reply, Dr. Khosrovani stated that with the exception of the problem of the
                        Helmand River, Iran’s relations with Afghanistan were good. Concerning Iraq,
                        he characterized relations as normal with some tension existing over the
                        Shatt-al-Arab River issue.</p>
                    <p>The President then reiterated that the United States was sympathetic with
                        Iran’s needs and that he would be communicating with His Majesty. He added
                        that he wished to emphasize: (1) the problem of foreign aid was under study;
                        (2) he hoped the Iranians would understand that his Administration is fully
                        aware of and concerned with the problem as posed by His Imperial Majesty;
                        (3) he was sending Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> to express his desire to maintain contact with the
                        Shah and to express our sympathetic understanding of the difficulties facing
                        Iran. The President then requested the General to convey his best wishes to
                        His Majesty, recalling to the Shah that he had visited Iran and had called
                        on His Imperial Majesty in 1951 and subsequently had met him in Florida. He
                        also expressed happiness that both the Shah and himself had sons born at
                        about the same time.</p>
                    <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0101"/>
                    <p>In answer to the President’s question as to whether the General had seen Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and other officials in the
                        United States, the General replied in the affirmative and commented that he
                        was very satisfied with his visit in the United States.</p>

                    <p>In a memorandum to the Secretary dated March 1, you indicated that the
                        President would like to have the Department’s recommendation as to whether a
                        personal letter might be sent to Prime Minister Qasim, the head of the Iraq
                            Government.<note n="1" xml:id="d18fn1">Reference is to <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No. 25 from <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, dated March 1, which also noted
                            that the President “would like to have a draft letter for his
                            consideration.” (Ibid.). A handwritten note on <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No. 25, initialed by <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> and dated March 2, reads: “I don’t know any
                            background on this except that President reportedly said he was writing
                            to lots of people these days—&amp; if it wld. help any for him to write
                            to Qasim—why not?” (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>In the Department’s view, a personal message from the President to a foreign
                        Chief of State or Head of Government is indeed a useful diplomatic tool.
                        With regard to Prime Minister Qasim of Iraq, we think this instrument might
                        well be employed, but preferably at some propitious occasion. U.S.-Iraq
                        relations during the past year have returned to a measure of normalcy.
                        Indications are that further improvement can be expected. However, the Iraqi
                        revolutionary regime still harbors strong suspicions that we have
                        “imperialistic” motivations. A Presidential message at this juncture,
                        coming, so to speak, out of the blue, might well puzzle the Iraqis and
                        rekindle suspicions that we have some ulterior motive.</p>

                    <p>You may assure the President that we are seeking an appropriate occasion for
                        the dispatch of a Presidential message to the Iraqi Prime Minister. We are
                        gratified by the President’s personal interest in this matter.</p>

                    <p>In response to reports that Israel intended to hold an anniversary parade on
                        April 20, 1961, in Jerusalem that would feature heavy military equipment,
                        Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs
                            <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> on March 10 expressed
                        U.S. concern to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> and
                        suggested that the military theme be eliminated from the parade. (Memorandum
                        of conversation, March 10; Department of State, Central Files,
                        884.424/3–1061) Israel, however, held a dress rehearsal for the parade in
                        Jerusalem March 16–17. Upon Jordan’s complaint, the Mixed Armistice
                        Commission determined that the Israeli action had violated the 1948
                        Israeli-Jordanian Armistice Agreement. (<gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss>
                        document S/4776)</p>
                    <p>On April 1, Jordan asked the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Security
                        Council to meet on the matter, charging that the parade was an act of
                        military provocation. The United States again expressed concern to Israeli
                        officials noting that the parade would violate the Armistice Agreement.
                        Israel cited previous similar violations by Jordan and refused to alter its
                        plans. (Telegrams 1900 and 1903 to <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>,

                        884.424/4–161 and 884.424/4–361) The United States then sought a consensus
                        statement endorsing the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> decision and
                        urging Israeli compliance, which would minimize debate and avoid the

                    <p>This effort was unsuccessful. Ultimately, the United States voted for a
                        Security Council resolution on April 11 that urged Israel to comply with the
                            <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> decision and requested members of

                        S/4785) Despite additional U.S. entreaties, Israel staged the military

                    <p>1164. Eyes only for President and Secretary. From <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d21fn1">On February 24, the
                            Department of State instructed the Embassy in Tehran to inform the Shah
                            that <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> would be able to
                            visit Tehran between March 12 and 14 following stops in several European
                            countries, if the Shah wished to issue an invitation. The Department
                            explained: “Highest levels in Washington have been concerned by the
                            flagging morale of Shah in recent months and we believe it would be
                            useful for <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> to proceed to
                            Tehran with personal greetings of President and to have general exchange
                            of views with Shah without, of course, making any definite program
                            commitments. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> has had
                            close association with Shah in past.” (Ibid., 123-<persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">W. Averell</persName>)</note> Had some six hours conversation with
                        Shah, the first third alone at his request and latter part at luncheon and
                        after with Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_WET1">Wailes</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZA5">Zahedi</persName>. How much permanent value
                        will result is hard to estimate, but <persName corresp="#p_WET1">Wailes</persName> agrees, and statement last night of Prime Minister
                        indicates, Shah was highly pleased by discussion and message from you
                        indicating <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0105"/>your interest in
                        supporting Iran as essential corridor to block Soviets’ advance into Middle
                        East. Of course, I made no commitments as to amount of military and economic
                        aid. I was able, however, to allay his fears that your statements about a
                        new policy towards neutrals did not mean an encouragement to Iran to return
                        to neutralism but referred only to countries which were unwilling to make
                        issue and join military alliance. I fully agreed with his statement that he
                        believes Iran would be lost if it attempted to adopt policy of neutralism.
                        The Communists would infiltrate and eventually take over; whereas Iran’s
                        role as strong partner of the West gives only hope for continued
                        independence and prosperity for Iranian people. He explained his belief that
                        Iran was only country in this part of world (with the possible exception of
                        Iraq) that had economic potential to develop European standard of living,
                        since it is underpopulated and has great potential with natural resources
                        including enormous expandable irrigated lands. Iran could be example of what
                        West could do against Communist claims. All of these developments, of
                        course, require large investments. The Shah asks that we give him a helping
                        hand in three areas: (1) his well-known request for military aid; (2)
                        economic and technical aid including Shiraz University (Shah is committed to
                        continue expansion education which has made great progress since my last
                        visit); (3) influence on oil companies for greater percentage of market
                        (Kuwait’s sale 50 percent greater than Iran’s burns him up).</p>
                    <p>He told me British Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Home</persName> had last week promised to help induce oil companies to
                        recognize political importance of Iran. He insists that we should do the
                        same. He maintains that if oil sales are increased, it would, thereby,
                        reduce his needs to beg aid from us. He is unhappy that most all our allies
                        belong to pacts of which we are member and are thus directly guaranteed. He
                        is not fully satisfied with <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine guarantee in bilateral agreement. He
                        feels that if we were serious about <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>,
                        we would insist upon strategic defense plan which he claims decision has
                        been constantly postponed by U.S. He states emphatically Iran would be
                        better off if U.S. would make up its mind what its long-term aid policy
                        would be and he could adjust his economic and military program to it.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WET1">Wailes</persName> and I told him that his
                        position in this regard made sense to us. I laid at rest his fears that you
                        might be making some special deal with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> which would leave him out on a limb and I gave
                        him definite assurances that you would never do this without prior
                        consultation. I explained your general attitude towards negotiations with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Almost every part of the world came up for discussion and he seemed to be
                        pleased to be able to discuss his views with us. He explained why it had
                        been necessary for him to have a cabinet of technicians but expressed a
                        desire to work towards political ministers with <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0106"/>more responsibility towards Majlis. In recent new shuffle
                        of Cabinet, he stated that he had given orders to his new Ministers to fight
                        corruption and specifically to the Finance Minister to be tough in
                        collecting more income taxes and to live up to stabilization agreement</p>
                    <p>He explained that the Prime Minister’s visit to Moscow, to take place in late
                        April or early May, was purely gesture of good will. The Foreign Minister
                        would not accompany him in order to avoid discussion of political
                        commitments. The Trade Minister would probably accompany him. He asked me to
                        assure you that you could count on his complete loyalty to the West and the
                        Iranian hope to play an increasingly important role in strengthening the
                        West against Kremlin and Peking aggression.</p>
                    <p>I am impressed with progress that has been made in ten years since I have
                        been here both in economic progress and in administration in which, however,
                        there remains much to be desired. Will discuss further details on
                            return.<note n="2" xml:id="d21fn2">The Embassy in Tehran reported to the
                            Department of State on March 15 that <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>’s visit had been very successful. Members of
                            the Iranian Government were very pleased and media coverage was
                            favorable. National front and dissident elements had delivered several
                            unsigned letters highly critical of the regime, which the Embassy had
                            returned because, “in our opinion, any alleged contact which could be
                            used by these people would materially weaken desired effect of visit.”

                            him to send it to Defense, indicating that it set forth the Department’s
                            thinking. In sending our paper to Defense, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> suggested that officers of the
                            two Departments meet shortly to work out an agreed U.S. position in
                            preparation for meetings in late April of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> Military Committee and Ministerial Council. <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>
                            would still hope for such an opportunity following your preliminary
                            discussion with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on March
                            17.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The general concept behind our draft paper is that the major threat to
                            the treaty area at the present time can be expected to come not from
                            external aggression on a massive scale but from failure to solve serious
                            social and economic problems to which the regional member states should
                            be devoting their major attention. At the same time, our paper suggests
                            that we should avoid assuming any attitude toward the military aspects
                            of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> which would have the effect
                            of discouraging the member states’ efforts to maintain their military
                            preparedness. The paper recommends that the United States not adhere
                            formally to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> nor participate in
                            the establishment of command arrangements but should continue general
                            support of the Organization, particularly in respect to political and
                            economic cooperation.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>By way of background it should be noted that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have been concerned for some time that
                            our support for <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, particularly in
                            the military field, has been so limited that the regional members are
                            becoming disillusioned and that <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                            is in danger of collapsing. They believe that, should <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> disintegrate, Iran would probably
                            retreat from its current orientation toward the West and eventually fall
                            under Soviet domination.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>With these views in mind, the Joint Chiefs recommended in October that
                            the United States undertake steps to invigorate <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> as a defensive military
                            organization. They made several specific proposals to this end which the
                            Department of Defense endorsed in general terms when forwarding them to
                            us for our comments. The principal recommendations of the Joint Chiefs
                            were: <list>

                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The draft paper at Tab A represents in essence the Department’s
                            substantive reply to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views. It
                            does not, however, respond as directly to points set forth in c. above
                            as it does to a. and b. The points in c. are among those which <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> believes may require further discussion
                            within the Department and subsequently with Defense, particularly the
                            matter of tactical nuclear capabilities. This latter point involves the
                            regional members’ insistence that they must know whether tactical
                            nuclear support would be available to support defense of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> area against Communist aggression.
                            On this matter we are faced by the dilemma of how to formulate an answer
                            which allays the regional members’ genuine concern but which at the same
                            time squares with our policy of not providing nuclear capabilities to
                            the indigenous forces of our non-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            allies in the Middle East.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>There are indications that, if the United States does not proceed
                            along the lines recommended by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>,
                            the Joint Chiefs may wish to disassociate themselves in the future from
                            the degree of personal involvement in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> military affairs to which they have been committed in
                            the past. We believe this whole matter should be approached gradually in
                            a manner not to discourage the defense efforts of the member states.
                            Since the Military Committee meeting now scheduled for April 24–25 was
                            postponed to that date in order to fit in with the heavy schedule of the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> members, it is desirable that
                            one of the Joint Chiefs keep this engagement.</item>

                    <p>On March 16, Radio Mecca announced that King Saud had ordered Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HDR2">Heath</persName> to be informed that the
                        Dhahran Airfield Agreement would not be renewed when it expires in April,
                        1962. The text of the broadcast is enclosed.<note n="1" xml:id="d24fn1">Attached but not printed.</note> The announcement followed three days
                        of discussions between the Ambassador and the Saudi Foreign Minister, <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0112"/>during which the Saudis first sought
                        United States concurrence in a proposed public statement abrogating the
                        Agreement, but subsequently reduced their proposal to announcing non-renewal
                        after April, 1962.<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">Documentation on the

                            611.86A7.</note> A few hours before the broadcast, the American Embassy
                        at Jidda reported the Foreign Minister’s assurance that any announcement
                        would be deferred until the evening of March 18 to enable a joint statement
                        to be prepared. The Departments of State and Defense were developing such a
                        joint statement when the Saudis acted unilaterally. In an effort to soften
                        the adverse impact of the Saudi announcement, the Department of State
                        immediately issued a background press release in the evening of March 16. A
                        copy is enclosed.<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1961</hi>, pp.

                    <p>King Saud’s precipitate action reflects the shaky internal position of his
                        recently formed Government. In this connection, the Saudi Arabian
                        Ambassador, at his request, called on the Under Secretary on the afternoon
                        of March 18 to convey an urgent message from the King explaining that the
                        rapid Saudi action had been made necessary to quiet his opponents both
                        inside and outside Saudi Arabia. The King also instructed the Ambassador to
                        reassure the United States that the strong relations between our two
                        countries were not affected by the announcement and would in fact be even
                        more soundly based in the future because of it. The Under Secretary told the
                        Ambassador that, while it was regrettable that the announcement had come so
                        abruptly which had precluded the development of a joint statement on the
                        subject, the United States reciprocated the hope that its close relations
                        with Saudi Arabia would continue to flourish. A telegram has since been
                        received from Jidda indicating that the King was pleased with the tenor of
                        the Department of State’s press release on the subject.</p>
                    <p>The United States has sought continually to stress in pertinent public
                        statements that the Dhahran Airfield belongs to Saudi Arabia and that the
                        United States does not have a “base” there. Nevertheless, the very presence
                        of United States military personnel in Saudi Arabia, even though unarmed,
                        has long disturbed Saudi and Arab nationalists. The Saudis have been keenly
                        conscious of their vulnerability to Arab nationalist attacks for being host
                        to foreign military forces. Alleged United States lack of sympathy for Arab
                        views on the Arab-Israel problem and Algeria have also been seized upon by
                        Arab nationalists to apply pressure on the Saudi Arabian Government to
                        terminate United States operational facilities at Dhahran. It had been
                        recognized for some time, <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0113"/>therefore,
                        that prospects for renewal of the Dhahran Airfield Agreement were doubtful,
                        and in December, 1960, the then Prime Minister, Crown Prince Faisal, had in
                        fact informally proposed voluntary United States relinquishment of our
                        Dhahran Airfield privileges. The proposal lapsed with the advent of the
                        King’s Government a few weeks later.</p>
                    <p>The Dhahran Airfield has been used primarily as a Military Air Transport
                        Service terminal, but also represents a potential post-strike field in
                        being. There are at present 1,332 American airmen stationed at Dhahran and
                        10 transport aircraft. Some months ago, the Department of Defense advised
                        the Department of State that, if possible, the Dhahran Airfield Agreement
                        should be renewed in 1962 to provide for additional facilities, but that
                        suitable alternatives were already under study by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        should the Saudis not wish to renew the Agreement. More difficult, however,
                        is the potential effect of the Saudi action on our military base complex
                        elsewhere and especially in Libya.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said that he had
                        been greatly impressed by the progress which he had noted in Tehran after an
                        absence of about ten years. The people looked better, the governmental
                        administration was improved although there is still corruption, and the
                        Iranians were doing better planning. The Shah was convinced that Iran’s
                        future lay only with the West and that it could not adopt a neutral position
                        like Afghanistan without eventual Communist take-over. The major economic
                        problem at the moment was due to lack of control of program expenditures.
                        The private sector had gone ahead more rapidly than expected which produced
                        a foreign exchange deficit. Some $40 million of cash support was needed to
                        tide them over until their Third Plan starts, otherwise the development
                        program would have to be cut back.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said that he had not felt that there was an
                        immediate prospect of a crisis <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0115"/>in
                        Iran. There are, however, a number of serious internal problems which
                        require political, social and economic reforms. We cannot compel the Shah to
                        undertake these reforms but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> believes that if we exert our influence progress
                        can be made.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> thought that we
                        should make up our minds as to the kind of aid, economic and military, that
                        we will supply to Iran and then sit down and discuss these plans frankly
                        with the Shah.<note n="1" xml:id="d26fn1">On March 19, <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> had offered these comments on
                            Iran: “Shah is at the moment our only hope of stability with pro-West
                            policy. Neutrality in Iran would mean Communist takeover.” <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> expressed his belief that the
                            “Shah should be supported, dealt with frankly, and not treated as an
                            unwanted stepchild. But he must be encouraged and pressed in social
                            progress in all fields, much of which he himself favors, and development
                            of democratic institutions which he said he planned to do on local level
                            and more cautiously on national.” (Telegram 1584 from Karachi; ibid.,
                            Central Files, 123-<persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">W. Averell</persName>)</note> Clearly we
                        would not be able to give the Shah everything he wants but if we can give
                        him reasonable confidence in our nuclear support and some modern equipment
                        even with reduced forces, he could be reasonably satisfied. We should be
                        able to convince him that he should concentrate more on his economic and
                        social problems. Even if we are going to cut our military aid or defense
                        support, we should tell the Shah so frankly. The Shah believes Iran should
                        have a larger share of the world oil market, particularly as compared to
                        Kuwait.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> expressed
                        confidence that Iran has the resources and manpower to break through the
                        modernization barrier. The Shah is more mature and confident than he was ten
                        years ago but he feels left alone and needs encouragement. He does not have
                        many good people around him whom he can trust. Ayub’s recent visit to Tehran
                        had an excellent effect on the Shah.</p>
                    <p>With respect to a possible reduction of tensions between Iran and the Soviet
                        Union, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> thought that we
                        should not oppose it so long as it does not go too far. A pledge of no
                        foreign missile bases would be acceptable but the Shah said he would not
                        make a commitment not to have any foreign bases on Iranian soil nor would he
                        sign a non-aggression pact with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                        The latter would result in Iran’s being forced out of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> thought we should work
                        closely with the Iranian planners and should encourage them in such fields
                        as land reforms, improved tax collection and stamping out corruption, and
                        also in establishing the right kind of effective fiscal controls.
                        Under-employment is a problem which should be dealt with and the
                        encouragement of reforms should be handled firmly but not aggressively. When
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Julius Holmes</persName> arrives in
                        Washington, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> would like
                        to discuss these problems with him.</p>

                        <p>The elections now being concluded have been a test of the Shah’s ability
                            to control a difficult political situation through his prestige and the
                            utilization of his security forces. The elections were largely rigged,
                            and diverse opposition political forces have not been able to force
                            their cancellation, despite several minor riots in Tehran and a few
                            disturbances in other parts of the nation. There were no deaths in
                            Tehran. The possibility, however, of a combination of circumstances in
                            the future <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0117"/>leading a combination
                            of opposition political elements and disaffected members of the security
                            forces toward an attempt to overthrow the regime cannot be discounted,
                            and will probably increase over the long run if present political trends
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>The Shah has been ruling through the security forces, which have been
                            loyal to him personally, and through an alliance with a part of the
                            traditionalist elements of Iranian society. He would like to enlist the
                            support and enthusiasm of the restive urban middle-class and
                            intellectual classes, but he cannot forget that under Mosadeq they
                            attempted to unseat him, and he realizes the danger that they would
                            raise popular and demagogic emotions against him if they were to be
                            given footholds within the government.</p>
                        <p>At the present time, communist influence in the main opposition groupings
                            appears to be limited—such influence as exists will probably increase
                            slowly. The communists by themselves pose no direct threat to the
                            regime, and are unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future. Their
                            primary potential lies in the infiltration of opposition groups. This
                            potential is accentuated by the absence of first-class political
                            leadership or a unifying political issue among groups opposed to the
                            present regime.</p>

                                    powerful opposition to the regime is represented by the heirs to
                                    the Mosadeq political tradition. This group, which is parallel
                                    to similar groups in most countries of the non-Western world,
                                    consists of the great majority of those urban elements who are
                                    caught between a traditional culture which they have rejected
                                    and a Western tradition which they cannot wholly accept. They
                                    are prone to xenophobia, to demagoguery, and to searching for
                                    scapegoats, and are personally frustrated and unhappy. Most of
                                    them dislike the British, the Russians, the traditional Iranian
                                    elite, and are increasingly distrustful of the United States.
                                    They tend to believe that the present regime is hopelessly
                                    inefficient and corrupt, that it is dominated by the military
                                    and security chiefs, and that it serves the interests of the
                                    West rather than the interests of the nation. Their influence
                                    over the urban masses is great, and is expanding with the spread
                                    of literacy, modern communications, and those economic and
                                    cultural processes which weaken the traditional culture.</p>
                                <p>The primary political manifestation of this group is the National
                                    Front and a smaller companion body known as the National
                                    Resistance Movement. A very recent and burgeoning element in
                                    these organizations arises from college and secondary school
                                    students. The established, though loosely organized, leadership
                                    of these movements consists of moderate-minded colleagues of
                                    Mosadeq, exemplified by Alayar Saleh and Karim Sanjabi,
                                    Ministers under Mosadeq. These men <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0118"/>are still in part the heirs of the old Iranian
                                    constitutionalist movement, believing in the forms of democracy
                                    and fearing the communists as much as they fear “imperialism”.
                                    They tend to be idealistic and impractical. They have great
                                    popular respect and prestige in the larger cities of Iran. The
                                    draft platform of the Front is neutralist, democratic, and
                                    socialist. They are not opposed to the institution of the
                                    monarchy.</p>
                                <p>There are increasing indications that these older leaders are
                                    losing their former tight control over the loyalties of their
                                    followers, and that younger, more radical, and more demagogic
                                    leaders are emerging, particularly in the new student movement,
                                    who regard the moderate leadership of the Front as ineffective,
                                    timid, and old. These newer leadership elements are much more
                                    prone to violent action, are more anti-United States, and are
                                    relatively vulnerable to communist penetration. They are
                                    encouraged and agitated by a powerful all-wave Soviet radio
                                    propaganda barrage which identifies the Shah with the United
                                    States, with militarism, and with corruption, and which urges
                                    the overthrow of his regime by violence.</p></item>

                                    found it easier to deal with the traditional elements of society
                                    than with the emergent urban groups, and while most landlords,
                                    many tribal leaders, senior bureaucrats, and large merchants are
                                    relatively content with the regime, the Shah does face serious
                                    rightist and reactionary opposition from the vested traditional
                                    elements which governed Iran before the advent of Reza Shah and
                                    during the 1941–1951 era. They consider the Shah to be a
                                    blundering upstart and would like to shove him aside in favor of
                                    the traditional ruling group. This group is concentrated among
                                    the feudal landlords, the religious leaders, and some
                                    discontented tribal leaders. Their power is in rural areas,
                                    religious cities such as Qom, and among the more ignorant
                                    elements in the provincial urban centers. They lack good
                                    leadership and do not pose a serious threat to the regime, since
                                    they fear the Mosadeqists more than they fear the Shah. One
                                    group of dissident tribal leaders is inclined to
                                    Mosadeqists.</p>
                                <p>There are two small but more positive rightist opposition groups.
                                    One consists of some very xenophobic religious leaders in the
                                    cities who once cooperated with Mosadeq but who split with him
                                    later, and who tend to cooperate now with <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> or Baqai (see below).
                                    These religious fanatics are given to assassination as a means
                                    of political expression. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Ali
                                        Amini</persName> leads a very loose group, recently
                                    penetrated and weakened by the Shah, which has looked forward to
                                    a union between moderate Mosadeqists and moderate conservatives
                                    under a Shah with reduced powers (the Shah is now the dictator
                                    of Iran for all practical purposes). <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has considerable prestige among
                                    conservatives, including some high-ranking officers of the

                                tightly-knit but small urban group, mostly from the workers and
                                extreme lower classes, held together by the personal magnetism and
                                ability of Mazafer Baqai, who is probably the best practical
                                political tactician in Iran, with a proven unlimited capacity for
                                demagoguery. Baqai has some fascist tendencies, and has connections
                                with like-minded Army colonels. He broke with Mosadeq, and is hence
                                anathema to the more moderate followers of the National Front, but
                                his political acumen makes him attractive to the students and other
                                younger groups. He has a bad personal reputation, and is a seeker
                                after power, pure and simple, with no political principles
                                whatsoever. He respects but fears the communists.</item>

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Pro-Westernism and Neutralism</hi></p>
                        <p>The Shah and his supporters, both military and civilian, are strongly
                            pro-Western at present. The majority of the Mosadeqists hate the United
                            Kingdom but are still not overtly hostile toward the United States and
                            Germany. This group resents Iran’s openly pro-Western foreign policy and
                            military alignment, however, and there is a growing tendency,
                            particularly among the younger and more radical elements, to identify
                            the United States with the Shah and with the security forces and to hold
                            the United States responsible for the Shah’s misdeeds and mistakes, real
                            and alleged. The general tendency of opinion among these groups is
                            neutralist along “Indian” lines, with a strong admixture of the
                            traditional Iranian distrust and fear of Russia. Leaders of the
                            traditional elite are divided between a minority favoring formal Iranian
                            alignment with the West and a majority favoring the traditional Iranian
                            policy of playing off big powers against each other and avoiding
                            commitments to any large power, while extracting the maximum in aid from
                            all sides.</p>
                        <p>Iran’s formal alignment with the West is popularly regarded as the Shah’s
                            personal venture, and he is judged by its consequences.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Rural Problems</hi></p>
                        <p>Many peasants automatically follow their landlords in all political
                            matters, particularly if the landlord is by long tradition accepted or
                            admired by his peasants. Aside from this, the political attitude of most
                            peasants is favorable to the Shah, whom they regard with an unconscious
                            and semi-religious veneration. If they disapprove, and they often do, of
                            the actions of specific government officials, they tend to ascribe such
                            actions to the existence of “bad people” around the Shah, and feel that
                            if he only knew the facts, he would change the situation to the
                            peasants’ benefit. By virtue of this blind rural following, the Shah
                            probably could win three-fourths or more of the votes in Iran in an
                            absolutely fair plebiscite. Unfortunately, the peasantry has no
                            tradition of political action and no knowledge of or interest in current
                            broad political problems. <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0120"/>It is
                            the object, not the subject, of political activity, and can be expected
                            to accept with fatalistic submission the decisions emanating from
                            Tehran.</p>
                        <p>The regime has sponsored and supported legislation toward community
                            development activities, toward the gradual breakup of large landed
                            estates, and toward the sale of government land to the cultivators. The
                            Shah has for years been distributing his own large estates to the
                            cultivators. Progress in land distribution is slow, primarily because
                            distribution cannot be effected without serious reductions in production
                            until adequate resources are available for the high capitalization and
                            maintenance costs inherent in most Iranian agriculture which requires
                            extensive credit, technical, and cooperative facilities. New
                            regulations, based on the 1960 Land Distribution Act, for
                            landlord-tenant relationships are now in process. In general, the
                            Iranian Government acts on the premise that the maintenance of
                            production takes precedence over politico-social advantages, although it
                            recognizes the latter factor. A rapidly improving agricultural education
                            and extension service is in operation. The next development plan, to
                            cost a billion dollars (a portion of which is expected to come from
                            foreign sources) and to operate from 1963 to 1968, lays heavy emphasis
                            on agricultural improvement, as against the current plan’s emphasis on
                            infrastructure and industry.</p>
                        <p>Mechanization, improved communications, and basic social forces,
                            including population increase, are throwing increasing numbers of the
                            peasantry into the cities as laborers. These migrants tend to lose their
                            traditional political and social inertia after a few years, and come to
                            some extent under the influence of urban opposition elements.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Security Forces</hi></p>
                        <p>The security forces of Iran, including the Army, are relatively
                            non-institutionalized. Peasant conscripts do as they are told, and in
                            the officer class can be seen a spectrum of the elements and forces of
                            contemporary urban society, with an admixture of (a) personal loyalty to
                            the Shah in the sense that an American ward heeler is loyal to a
                            political boss, and (b) a small but growing professionalism
                            concentrating on the techniques of the military.</p>
                        <p>The Army exists in part, as it did under the Shah’s father, as a tool of
                            personal power for the ruler. The Shah devotes an inordinate amount of
                            his time and energy to military matters, and is almost obsessed with
                            increasing its size and obtaining the most modern military equipment.
                            The fulfillment of these ambitions was probably the primary purpose
                            which he had in mind when he formally aligned Iran with the West. With
                            the physical power of the Army solidly behind him, the Shah could
                            probably remain in power indefinitely, playing his traditionalist and
                            Mosadeqist enemies off against one another. The Shah very cleverly plays
                            off individuals and groups in the military against one another in <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0121"/>order to prevent the rise of key
                            personalities who could possibly take the machine away from him.</p>
                        <p>The loyalty of the security forces remains doubtful, however. The Chief
                            of Army Intelligence in 1958 was caught at plotting with moderate
                            conservative opposition leaders and has just emerged from jail. Several
                            key conservative generals have in the past approached the United States
                            and the United Kingdom for help in plots to overthrow the Shah with some
                            civilian help. It is probable that “nationalist” sentiment of the
                            Mosadeq type is widespread and is increasing among that majority of
                            junior officers who have urban middle class backgrounds. There is,
                            however, no single key military figure and no philosophy of government
                            peculiar to the military which could be posed as an alternative to the
                            present Shah-Army key ruling element. A purely military and conservative
                            successor regime would have little hope for a long life, since the
                            military as it exists is disliked and distrusted by opposition elements
                            even more than is the Shah.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Underlying Factors</hi></p>
                        <p>Under the Shah, Iran has made considerable progress in economic
                            development, in social welfare, and in internal security and
                            administrative efficiency. This progress has, however, taken place
                            without participation in the government by the main opposition groups.
                            To some extent, the Shah’s isolation from these groups has been due to
                            his unwillingness to ride demagogic issues appealing to the lower
                            popular passions—he could even now, for instance, rally popular support
                            behind himself by launching a self-defeating demagogic campaign against
                            the Oil Consortium, against minority racial and religious groups, or
                            against Iraq or the United Kingdom on territorial issues. To an equal
                            extent, however, it has been due to his unwillingness to listen to
                            critical advice, to his unwillingness to share power, and to his
                            near-obsession with military affairs.</p>
                        <p>With the confidence and support of the Mosadeqists, the Shah could easily
                            control his rightist opposition. The converse, however, is not true. The
                            force and power of the urban semi-Westernized elements continue to grow
                            at the expense of other elements of society. Unless and until the Shah
                            can come to terms with them and bring them, or part of them, into the
                            process of policy making, he faces a remorseless and slowly increasing
                            pressure, which will become sharper and more dangerous to the West as
                            moderate leadership elements are displaced by the radicals. It seems
                            unlikely, however, that the Shah can capture the loyalty of this element
                            without abandoning the military as his internal political base, without
                            giving up much of his power, without abandoning his openly pro-Western
                            foreign alignment, and without taking steps <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0122"/>inimical to internal security and to practical economic
                            development. He is unlikely to be willing to pay such a price.</p>
                        <p>Another very important element is the Shah’s alternative with regard to
                            foreign policy. The Shah, though highly intelligent, is emotionally
                            insecure, and shares with other Iranians a deep suspicion that the West
                            may abandon him in the course of détente with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or by supporting his internal
                            opposition. The recent change of administration in Washington has
                            heightened his anxieties. He is bitterly disappointed with the quantity
                            of United States military aid in terms of money and hardware;<note n="4" xml:id="d27fn4">In <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 total
                                    <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> aid to Iran amounted to
                                about $75 million, plus about $19 million in Defense Support. From

                                of about $567 million has been extended to Iran. [Footnote in the

                            quantity and procedures of United States economic aid to Iran in the
                            context of a current difficult and unpopular economic stabilization

                            insistence, and he suspects that the United States is cooling toward
                                <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and hence toward its
                            military assistance plans for the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> regional allies. He is under strong Soviet propaganda
                            attack, and the Soviets have made it clear to him that if he will move
                            toward neutralism, he can escape this pressure and can expect economic
                            and even some military assistance from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as well as assistance from the United States, citing
                            Afghanistan and India.</p>
                        <p>The Shah is capable of making such a switch—one of our Ambassador’s main
                            tasks has been to dissuade him, to soothe him, and to reassure him of
                            United States support. Even so, the Shah has authorized his Prime
                            Minister to go to Moscow on a “good-will” visit in March or April,
                            though he continues to resist Soviet demands for political
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>Two other factors of the internal political situation often mentioned as
                            important are corruption and the suppression of civil liberties. The
                            former has always been a feature of Iranian administrations, and, though
                            the Shah himself is honest, many of his family and entourage are not.
                            Such dishonesty is not a major factor in the economic situation, and is
                            probably decreasing slowly. It is normal for any political attack in
                            Iran to be accompanied by charges of corruption.</p>
                        <p>There is a limited press censorship in Iran, and arrests and temporary
                            deportations are rather common measures to avert political disorders.
                            Freedom of assembly is often limited, but there is great freedom of
                            speech. Iran is far from being a “police state” in the ordinary sense of
                            the word.</p>
                        <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0123"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">What Can the United States
                            Do?</hi></p>
                        <p>It is often suggested that the United States, using its aid programs as
                            leverage, could issue orders to the Shah which would by their
                            implementation result in political tranquillity. It has been suggested
                            that some of these “reform” measures would be the ending of corruption,
                            the establishment of genuine democratic institutions, the downgrading of
                            the military, further land reform, and the sharing of power with
                            Mosadeqist leaders.</p>
                        <p>These suggestions presuppose that the Shah is a creature of the United
                            States and the United Kingdom, a common misconception in Iran. Any
                            United States ultimatums or even heavy-handed hints would be regarded by
                            the Shah as an intolerable interference in his affairs and would
                            probably result in corresponding moves on his part toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and neutralism.</p>
                        <p>Granted that this difficulty could be overcome, it is evident that the
                            suggested “reform” measures are not simple matters. Corruption in our
                            sense is a part of the Iranian culture, often associated with family
                            ties, and the Shah relies on traditional elements of society in his
                            government. Civil servants will probably continue to accept bribes
                            unless they are able to afford a European standard of living on their
                            salaries alone. This would entail an unacceptable gap in living
                            standards between them and the mass of the population. Free elections to
                            the Parliament today would result in a Majlis controlled by reactionary
                            landlords and the clergy, with a vociferous and demagogic Mosadeqist
                            minority from the big cities. Iranian politics would be polarized to the
                            point of civil war. The restriction of suffrage to literates would
                            result in a Mosadeqist majority, but there is no indication that a
                            Mosadeqist government, representing perhaps fifteen percent of the
                            population, would represent the submerged rural masses even as well as
                            the present government does. In any case, this kind of freedom would be
                            tantamount to asking the Shah to abdicate, and would entail a foreign
                            policy shift away from the United States.</p>
                        <p>To ask the Shah to de-emphasize the military element in the Iranian
                            Government would be to attack his most sensitive personal quirk, and
                            would completely dishearten him. He would have to deprive himself of a
                            highly practical element of his personal power, as well as to abandon
                            the military dreams so dear to him.</p>
                        <p>Hasty and sweeping land reforms without careful preparation and heavy
                            expenses would disrupt rural society, turn most landlords into bitter
                            personal enemies of the Shah, result in immediate hardship to the
                            peasants, retard mechanization and soil conservation, and decrease
                            agricultural production. Urban opposition groups would be pleased, not
                                <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0124"/>because of any solicitude for
                            the peasantry, but because of the discomfiture of the landlords.</p>
                        <p>The admission of Mosadeqist leaders to the government, while the most
                            promising of the suggested reforms, would mean a reduction of the Shah’s
                            powers, an eventual reduction of the role of the military, and a danger
                            of cutting the moderate Mosadeqists off from their followings. The Shah
                            would regard such a suggestion as proof positive that the United States
                            had turned against him.</p>
                        <p>Another broad and basic suggestion for United States policy would be to
                            increase its support of the Shah. To satisfy His Majesty, this would
                            have to involve very heavy expenses in military, as well as financial
                            assistance, would identify the United States even more with the Shah’s
                            authoritarian regime, and would accentuate rather than solve the basic
                            political dilemma.</p>
                        <p>Still another suggestion involves United States and United Kingdom
                            support to a conservative military group, perhaps with ties to the
                            moderate <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> conservatives, to
                            take over power by a coup. The resulting successor regime, without
                            charismatic and practical leadership not in sight today, would have all
                            the Shah’s problems without the tremendous stabilizing force represented
                            by the monarchical institution, and would solve nothing.</p>
                        <p>The most forthright and extreme suggestion involves Western support to a
                            hypothetical Mosadeqist-oriented coup, with support from junior
                            officers. While the resulting regime would not be strongly anti-United
                            States and would have popular urban support, it would entail the
                            following probable awesome disadvantages, which would accrue at an early
                            date should such a regime remain in power: <list>

                        <p>It would appear preferable that the United States would be best advised
                            to continue its present policy of reassurance to the Shah of United
                            States sympathy and support, along with persistent but delicate
                            inferences by our Ambassador to the effect that the Shah should devote
                            his attention to his internal political problems rather than to foreign
                            and military affairs. We would also continue our policy of monitoring
                            the Shah’s dealings with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            pointing out Soviet traps, depreciating the effect of Soviet propaganda,
                            and warning him of Soviet intentions. We should continue to provide him
                            with reasonable economic and military assistance, and, in the context of
                            more general changes in our mutual security mechanisms, reduce the
                            delays and contradictions in our assistance programs which tend to
                            irritate and demoralize him.</p>
                        <p>The implementation of this program will require, as it has in the past,
                            the greatest possible delicacy on the part of our Ambassador in handling
                            his personal relationship with the Shah.</p>
                        <p>We should, of course, continue to be on the alert for the rise of
                            competent and creative alternate leadership, in or out of the military,
                            which might allow a reconsideration of our alternatives. This latter,
                            along with the requirement that we do what we can to support moderate as
                            against extreme opposition leadership, is very difficult in Iran, since
                            Embassy contacts with the important Mosadeqist opposition elements have
                            met and will continue to meet with violent objections from the Shah.

                            AND IMPLICATIONS THEREOF FOR U.S. POLICY</p>

                        <p>A meaningful definition of the Iranian urban middle class must be
                            sociological and historical, not primarily economic. The urban middle
                            class constitutes that element of Iranian society in which there are
                            present two cultures, two value systems, the traditional and the
                            Western. Those elements of society in which the traditional value
                            systems are overwhelmingly predominant are excluded, i.e., the
                            peasantry, both in the countryside and recently arrived in the large
                            cities, most landlords, older religious leaders, and the great majority
                            of small merchants and artisans outside the capital. Similarly excluded
                            is the very small minority of thoroughly Westernized individuals, in
                            high levels of society, who are really strangers in their own
                            society.</p>
                        <p>The political middle class must be identified with the process of
                            cultural clash. We may for the purposes of this paper attempt a rough
                            breakdown of the urban middle class as follows: <list>

                                        contractors, richer merchants who have shed the limits of
                                        the bazaar mentality, senior officials and professors, and
                                        other top professional types. Iranian society is and always
                                        has been relatively mobile, and this class includes
                                        individuals who have risen from below and others who have
                                        dropped down into it from the traditional elite.</p></item>

                                        products of the local universities and secondary

                                <item><p>The lower middle class.</p>
                                    <p>It is typified by clerks, skilled workers, taxi drivers, and
                                        that portion of the urban proletariat which has been cut
                                        adrift by long city residence from the thought patterns of
                                        the traditional society. It appears to be extending itself
                                        downward with the erosion of the traditional structure of
                                        society. There is a small increment of individuals who drop
                                        into it from the middle middle class. It is literate but
                                        otherwise poorly educated.</p></item>

                        <p>The key to the entire class lies in the middle group. Most of the upper
                            group is “in” at the present time; is economically satisfied, feels
                            itself participating in and adjusted to the status quo to some extent,
                            and, while ready to support any stable regime which would not disturb
                            its position, is at least passively content with things as they are.
                            From this relatively sophisticated group, however, particularly among
                            the younger elements with foreign educations, is drawn much of the
                            political leadership for which the key middle group is crying. The lower
                            middle class is restive and dissatisfied, and by virtue of its numbers
                            will form the mass of effective street demonstrations, but depends on
                            the groups above it to provide the political and social channels for the
                            expression of its discontent. The comments below will be concentrated on
                            the key middle group.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Psychological Characteristics</hi></p>
                        <p>It is well known that individuals the world over tend to rationalize
                            political behavior which stems from deep emotional needs. This is
                            particularly true with regard to extremist views aimed at radical
                            changes in an existing society. To take at face value the
                            rationalizations of an Iranian middle class leader is as unrewarding as
                            to accept the rationalizations of anti-Semites, Negro-haters, or
                            communists in the United States. Some understanding of the psychological
                            background of such individuals is necessary in order to be able to
                            understand them and to predict their behavior.</p>
                        <p>The political reactions of the key elements of the Iranian middle class
                            find their psychological roots in the fact that these people are partly
                            Westernized and partly attached to their traditional culture. The result
                            is an inability to adjust to society, and an inability to find security.
                            Thus, if a student tries to “date” a girl, and to choose his own wife,
                            one side of his “super-ego” tells him that he is behaving atrociously;
                            if he asks his parents to find him a wife and does not expect to become
                            acquainted with her until after the marriage, the other side says he is
                            behaving atrociously. He is continually frustrated, unhappy, and unable
                            to achieve adjustment to, and security within, his society.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, he is oppressed by feelings of inferiority. He has lost
                            the deft understanding which enables one to fit into the traditional
                            society in its small middle niches; he is unable to sense the nuances
                            which allow for security through sycophancy, flattery, and the
                            manipulation of chains of influence. He is likewise, with only a few
                            exceptions, quite incompetent by Western standards. There is enough of
                            the traditional culture in him that he is not able to work for the sake
                            of the results, and to view a task as separate from considerations of
                            personal prestige and status.</p>
                        <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0128"/>
                        <p>He is not willing to accept now the old idea of status, self-fulfillment,
                            and success resting upon traditional values, nor can he adjust to the
                            ideally Western concept of rewarding an individual strictly according to
                            how he performs. Too often, he tends to accept the basic idea of rewards
                            based on membership in an autocratic group, but wishes to substitute for
                            the badges of the traditional autocracy what he conceives as the badge
                            of Western autocracy—“educational qualifications”. He feels,
                            understandably enough, that he should, by virtue of formal educational
                            qualifications, be allowed to attain the security and status of an
                            informal autocracy. The traditionalist element of society refuses to
                            recognize this claim, holding rather that “qualifications” are based on
                            traditional values; the Westerner laughs at him and tells him that
                            performance, continual performance against competition, is the only
                            standard by which status can be achieved.</p>
                        <p>Our typical member of the urban middle class now becomes desperate. He
                            becomes anxious and then angry. He cannot, as a normal human being,
                            admit of his inadequacy to meet either system, much less the confused
                            mixture of both which confronts him. He suspects that he is being
                            persecuted and plotted against, and develops aggressive desires for
                            revenge against “the system”.</p>
                        <p>These desires are channelled, naturally, against both of the structures
                            which form the underpinnings of his society. He applies Western
                            standards against the traditional element of his society, and finds it
                            wanting. He applies traditional standards in a critique of the Western
                            element in his society, and naturally finds it wanting, too. It is a
                            short step from these judgments to an uncritical aggressive desire for
                            revenge, and for a final justification of himself by punishing and
                            humiliating the two figures who seemingly mock at his plight, the
                            self-assured member of the traditional upper class and the self-assured
                            Westerner.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Good and Evil</hi></p>
                        <p>There are certain key concepts of the world which are born and bred into
                            Iranians which unfortunately tend to sharpen the terrible psychological
                            dilemma outlined above. They are rooted in Iranian history, and can be
                            traced back to Zoroastrianism and picked up again in the Iranian
                            interpretation of Shi’a Islam.</p>
                        <p>Persians tend to believe in the all-pervasive presence of a powerful
                            force of evil in the world. All actions, all motives, are divisible into
                            good and evil. It is probable at any time in history that the forces of
                            evil control the world, while the good man, like the hidden Imam, is
                            forced to hide and remain inconspicuous, to lie and pretend if need be,
                            until the moment arrives for battle. Thus, most Persians cannot ascribe
                            political actions with which they disagree to error, or to grant good
                            intentions to the <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0129"/>author of such
                            actions. The term “political compromise” cannot be translated into
                            colloquial Persian without a connotation of “sell-out”.</p>
                        <p>Two results follow from this—first, since the forces of evil are strong
                            and organized, actions by others which one disapproves are not isolated,
                            they are linked together in a mesh of intertwining conspiracies with an
                            overall evil motive behind them. Second, public and private morality are
                            inextricably confused—no politician with a reprehensible private life
                            can be other than evil in his public actions, and no saintly man can be
                            really wrong in his public life.</p>
                        <p>As a corollary of the above, Persians tend to follow blindly a man who
                            has convinced them that he is on the side of right, without examining
                            political issues critically. Since members of the urban middle class
                            have deep aggressive drives against the traditional ruling class and the
                            Westerner, it is natural to associate a saintly leader with opposition
                            to these two forces. All the ingredients are present for what we would
                            call demagogic politics directed against them as scapegoats and as evil
                            forces.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Foreigners</hi></p>
                        <p>Persians, and especially the urban middle class, have, from historical
                            experience and from their own peculiarities, evolved an amazing
                            political mythology whereby almost all political developments are viewed
                            in terms of foreign influence, usually selfish and malignant. Most such
                            influence has been ascribed to the Russians and the British; practically
                            every national leader was in the past characterized as “pro-British” or
                            “pro-Russian”. Since German and U.S. power was far away and supposedly
                            disinterested, members of the urban middle class for a long time tended
                            to describe themselves as “pro-German” or “pro-American”. Nowadays, with
                            the U.S. obviously in the Shah’s graces, the term “pro-American” is
                            taking on the evil overtone which “pro-British” has had; the Germans are
                            out of the picture.</p>
                        <p>There is a deep residue of hatred and distrust of Russia in Iran, but
                            communism has its attractions. This attraction for the urban middle
                            class is based primarily on (a) the communist opposition to the existing
                            scheme of things, and (b) a hope that communism really means that the
                            “educationally qualified” urban middle class displaces the traditional
                            autocracy and thereafter enjoys status, security, and justification.
                            However, even the most angry and frustrated Persian tends to draw back
                            in alarm when he suspects that a Russian lurks behind the fair mask of
                            communism.</p>

                        <p>Let us set aside immediately the common conception that the urban middle
                            class is primarily concerned with national economic development. <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0130"/>Nothing interests it less. It
                            would like an aristocratic standard of living, but it channels this
                            desire primarily through the idea of stepping into the seats of the
                            traditional ruling class and the high-living Westerners resident in
                            Iran. It has repeatedly shown its almost total lack of concern for the
                            peasantry and even for the urban proletariat, except insofar as it can
                            turn these groups against the traditional ruling class and the West. It
                            is noteworthy that the consumption levels of the urban middle class have
                            been rising sharply over the past eight years, while its political
                            discontent has been rising even more sharply.</p>
                        <p>Members of the class, with Western tastes whetted by an addiction to
                            movie-going, often bemoan the absence of “a decent standard of living”
                            for themselves. This “decent standard” is measured in Western terms. Its
                            provision, in a society still desperately poor, would obviously result
                            in a profound increase in the gap between the educated and the
                            uneducated, and therefore of “social injustice”.</p>
                        <p>This class has, over the past ten years, shown itself to be ready at any
                            time to put almost all other factors ahead of economic development for
                            the nation. They have opposed infrastructure development and have
                            instead demanded relatively non-productive amenities such as hospitals,
                            colleges, asphalt streets, and urban water and sewage systems. They have
                            been particularly opposed to any development involving foreign
                            contractors or suppliers, which they feel is by definition somewhat
                            nefarious.</p>
                        <p>It is important to note, however, that an expanding economy and a high
                            rate of investment, particularly in the private sector, provide (a)
                            attractive outlets for the energies of the more intelligent and
                            better-educated members of the class, and (b) obviate the dangers of
                            mass urban unemployment. They do not effectively modify political and
                            psychological attitudes, but they dilute the readiness of the urban
                            population to take drastic action along the lines indicated by these
                            attitudes.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Political Aspirations</hi></p>
                        <p>Most members of the class look back on the Mosadeq era with undisguised
                            nostalgia. We are thus not operating in a vacuum when we attempt to
                            determine the results of a political change or changes in which power
                            would come into the hands of this group.</p>
                        <p>In 1957, one urban middle class group indicated in a public manifesto
                            that it was willing to live with <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                            and with the Consortium Agreement. We must note, however, that the
                            leader of this particular group is probably the most moderate of all
                            potential leaders of the class, and that he and his followers admitted
                            openly that the promise represented the stiff price which they are
                            willing to pay for American “support” in a bid for power. In practice,
                            it seems highly unlikely that any leader would be able to hold to such a
                            position for long. His rivals would <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0131"/>make life intolerable for him by accusing him of being
                            a stooge of the West. It is almost a certainty that any government
                            responsive to the urban middle class would as a minimum be forced to
                            withdraw from <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and initiate some
                            kind of squeeze on the Consortium, at least to the extent that it could
                            prove to its followers that it was hostile to Western interests.
                            Similarly, in the international arena, such a government would be forced
                            to display its opposition to Western interests in the Arab world, the
                            Congo, the Far East, and other trouble spots, and to extend sympathy to
                            urban middle class leaders in those areas who are now opposing the
                            West.</p>
                        <p>It is highly probable that, as another minimum, the U.S. military mission
                            to Iran would be invited to leave. The Army is highly unpopular with the
                            urban middle class, and to retain any position whatever in society, the
                            Army itself would have to acquiesce in good grace.</p>
                        <p>The urban middle class has historically had no interest in or knowledge
                            of financial realities. The degree of financial stability which has been
                            maintained recently would almost certainly go overboard. One cannot
                            imagine school teachers agreeing to postpone wage demands, for example,
                            in view of esoteric and complicated financial factors, nor a government
                            responsive to the urban middle class refusing to embark on a highly
                            desirable hospital-building program because there was not enough money
                            in the kitty. After all, as in the Mosadeq era, the printing press is
                            always available.</p>
                        <p>Democracy in the Western sense means nothing to the urban middle class.
                            It is probable that the oft-proposed measure to disenfranchise the
                            illiterate classes would be brought up again and adopted, if there were
                            any desire to utilize a freely-elected assembly.</p>
                        <p>The urban middle class complains bitterly about corruption in the
                            government, but shows little interest in reducing corruption at low
                            levels. Rather, it sympathizes with low-level officials in trouble for
                            this reason, and insists that nothing can be done to remedy the basic
                            problem until high-level corruption, involving the traditional upper
                            class and foreigners, is eliminated. Almost all members of the upper
                            class and most foreigners are believed to be guilty of corruption,
                            unless they are openly sympathetic to the Mosadeqist groups. It seems
                            quite likely that this middle class concern over corruption is actually
                            a rationalization of its deeper emotional antipathies, and its
                            justification in terms of the actual situation is coincidental.</p>
                        <p>The traditional upper classes, and the upper strata of the upper middle
                            class as well, would probably be victimized in one way or another,
                            ranging from confiscatory taxation to hanging. These policies would
                            naturally quickly dry up the sources of capital formation for the
                            private sector of the economy. Economic enterprise would turn toward the
                            statist road, primarily because it is in the bureaucracy that the urban
                                <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0132"/>middle class is closest to
                            having a vehicle through which it can institutionalize status and
                            security for itself.</p>

                        <p>The aspirations described above do not constitute a prediction of the
                            future. They represent the existing political raw material provided by
                            the urban middle class. When one considers that they are inchoate,
                            contradictory, and emotional in essence, it is obvious that they will be
                            shaped by leadership. They cannot be disregarded. They are growing and
                            spreading every day at an accelerating rate, upward into the younger
                            sons of the aristocracy and downward into the proletariat, pushed by
                            increasing urbanization. Their spread can only be stopped by stopping
                            the process of culture clash, and that is impossible in the world of
                            today.</p>
                        <p>There is no discernible competent leadership in the urban middle class at
                            present. Should its incompetent leadership of today be catapulted into
                            power, it is likely that a process of confused demagoguery would ensue,
                            which would result in uncoordinated moves in the direction of the
                            various negative aspirations listed above and increase potential for the
                            communists, who obviously by virtue of their program and organization,
                            would have a good chance of eventually filling the vacuum if they have
                            learned to stop bowing publicly in the direction of the hated
                            Russians.</p>
                        <p>The Iranian military does not offer potential leadership which could deal
                            with these aspirations and satisfy them. Most junior officers share the
                            prejudices of the middle class families from which they sprang; senior
                            officers are roundly hated as members of the traditional
                            aristocracy.</p>
                        <p>Traditional leaders—clergy, landlords, and the really big merchants—offer
                            little hope of providing competent leadership, and are blind to the
                            threat which the urban middle class represents. It might conceivably
                            still be possible to “bypass” the urban middle class by providing a
                            dynamic to the inert traditional-minded peasantry and proletariat,
                            perhaps based on a regeneration of Shi’a Islam with new values
                            adjustable to semi-Western values and to modern techniques of production
                            and organization. But there is no sign of the gigantic creativity which
                            would be necessary for such a reversal of the current historical
                            trend.</p>
                        <p>There is one potential leader who has the necessary ability, personality,
                            and talent, and whose political capital is not yet quite exhausted. That
                            is the Shah himself. The Shah would still be capable, if he could only
                            see the truth, of taking steps like the following which might allow him
                            to seize and mold middle class aspirations.</p>

                            possible that the Shah could turn the trick. He has the brains, the

                    </list>
                    <p>On March 27 you inquired regarding the status of the promised invitation for
                        American experts to visit quietly the Israeli nuclear reactor at Dimona.
                        Deputy Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JRW3">Roger Jones</persName>
                        promised to provide you with a reply. This invitation was first promised to
                        us by Prime Minister Ben-Gurion on January 4 through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ROR1">Reid</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d28fn1">See <ref target="#d1">Document 1</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>The enclosed chronology regarding the Dimona reactor shows that the
                        Department has been reminding the Israel Government at approximately weekly
                        intervals through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> of
                        the importance of an early “quiet” visit by Americans to Dimona.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">Attached but not printed.</note></p>
                    <p>Following your telephone call, Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Lewis Jones</persName> called in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> and again told him that we are
                        anxiously waiting the Israeli invitation (see memorandum of conversation
                            enclosed).<note n="3" xml:id="d28fn3">Attached but not printed. Also in
                            Department of State, Central Files, 884A.1901/3–2861.</note> On this
                        occasion <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>, who personally shares
                        our belief that the visit should take place soon, reiterated the
                        difficulties occasioned by the internal political crisis in Israel. He said,
                        and our Embassy at Tel Aviv confirms, that the Israeli leaders are
                        profoundly preoccupied by their internal political problems. This is
                        particularly true of Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, who is personally in charge
                        of Israel’s atomic energy program.</p>
                    <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0135"/>
                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> urged <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> to make a new effort to hasten the
                        invitation, <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said he would do so
                        but that in any case it was unlikely that any decision could be taken in
                        Israel during the next few days. Between April 3 and April 10 is Passover
                        Week, when little work is done in Israel.</p>
                    <p>The Department believes that <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> is
                        probably right regarding the unlikeli<persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> of the Israelis issuing an invitation prior to April
                        10, although our latest démarche to <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> using your name is likely to be helpful to this
                        end.</p>
                    <p>We believe that Ben-Gurion fully intends to issue the invitation. Part of his
                        difficulty is (a) that, having given his word, he does not like to be pushed
                        by the United States, and (b) he is personally in the greatest internal
                        political difficulty of his career. He probably feels that his problems may
                        be compounded if his enemies have something new to pin on him arising out of
                        his handling of the Dimona reactor affair. It is for the latter reason that
                        when the visit takes place it should be a quiet one regarding which there
                        should be no United States publicity.</p>

                    <p>In response to an earlier request by the Chiefs, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> to report on current conditions in
                        Iran.</p>
                    <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0136"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> observed that the situation
                        in Iran could never really be called good. Iran was somewhat like an
                        individual who was consistently subject to a low grade chronic fever. Each
                        time you took a new look at the patient there was no clear evidence of a
                        crisis but sometimes the temperature was down a little, sometimes it was up
                        a little. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> noted that the
                        Shah had been concerned that the new Administration might withdraw the
                        support that had earlier been given to him by the U.S. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>’s letter and the recent visit of
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> had helped
                        considerably to abate his fears.</p>
                    <p>In analyzing the February elections, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> commented that the urban centers appeared to be free
                        of communist infiltration; the opposition had been split by the student
                        community and the followers of Mosadeq; the opposition appeared to have made
                        gains in the student community but not in other areas; and the security
                        forces were surprisingly efficient in dealing with election disturbances. In
                        commenting on the security forces, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> stated that there does not appear to be any
                        significant rebel groupings in the security forces who are ready to cast
                        their lot with the civilian opposition.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> noted that the Shah had
                        lost some prestige following the election but had regained his position by
                        firing four unpopular security chiefs and replacing them with men who were
                        free of charges of corruption and brutality. In his concluding observation
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> remarked that the Shah
                        continues to have a long range problem with the opposition, particularly the
                        students and the Mosadeq followers. The Shah could become popular with those
                        groups if he were to detach himself from the United States. He has, however,
                        not shown any signs of wavering. In addition he has adhered to the highly
                        unpopular economic stabilization program which is necessary if he is to deal
                        adequately with his economic problems.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> expressed his
                        concern as to whether we will be able to continue our present military aid
                        programs. As a result of the Shah’s last visit we had agreed to an
                        accelerated program for Iran which we cannot continue under the proposed
                        1962 military assistance program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> observed that under the 1962
                        program Iran will be cut in terms of new programs but that he thought the
                        expenditure and delivery level in 1962 would remain roughly the same. There
                        was a serious problem with regard to the Defense Support Program which was
                        on dead-center. In previous years we had given the Shah assurances on the
                        Defense Support level by this time but we have not done so this year.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> thought that the
                        proposed program reductions for Iran would soon become apparent to the
                        Shah.</p>
                    <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0137"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> remarked that one of the
                        first things we should do is determine what part of the military aid program
                        is required for military purposes and what is for political purposes. With
                        regard to the latter we might be able to meet this purpose by assuring the
                        Shah of long term economic aid in lieu of military aid. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> observed that the Shah is very
                        sensitive about the military program and in General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>’s opinion our programs are
                        clearly military and geared to the increased forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> observed that we have to face up to
                        the fact that we will not be able to meet the 1958 commitment under the
                        present $1.6 billion program for 1962. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> will have to tackle this problem as
                        soon as he arrives. It may be possible through other types of economic aid
                        to pick up part of the Iranian budget which would free up funds to offset
                        reductions in our <gloss target="#t_DS1">DS</gloss> levels.</p>

                            in this regard—but we doubt their expectations—may be heightened by the

                            Possibly they may also look to that <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0138"/>meeting and to the Ministerial Council Session for

                                    however, it would be appropriate for <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> to consider the extent to which these

                                    arrangements which became effective in January 1960, i.e.,
                                    establishment of the Permanent Military Deputies Group (<gloss target="#t_PMDG1">PMDG</gloss>) and reorganization <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0139"/>of the Combined Military

                                    upon the continued validity of these arrangements. Should the

                                    disbanded at a relatively early date, the United States will
                                    show an open mind toward new organizational proposals which are

                                    into effect in January 1960. The extension would be for another
                                    tour of duty, not a permanent undertaking. If, on the other
                                    hand, the Chief of Staff position is to assume additional

                                    organizational arrangements, such as elevation of the rank of

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that he had come
                        in under instructions to convey an invitation for an American to visit the
                        Dimona reactor site during the week of May 15. The Israeli Government wished
                        the visit to be secret since any publicity could have a most undesirable
                        effect.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPJ1">Farley</persName> said that the handling of
                        the visit had been given a good deal of thought on the U.S. side. Our
                        concept had been that, on the pattern of U.S. technical consultations with
                        other countries engaged in reactor development, a pair of U.S. reactor
                        experts with competence in planning and design of heavy water reactors might
                        go to Israel for discussions with the Israeli scientists and engineers
                        engaged in the project. Such discussions might well be very useful to the
                        Israeli technicians. The discussions would give an opportunity in a most
                        natural way for an incidental visit to the reactor site. The United States
                        did not wish publicity and would want to handle the trip quietly, but to
                        label it “secret” and make extreme efforts to avoid any knowledge of the
                        visit might be counter-productive.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> emphasized the
                        importance his government attached to the visit not becoming known either
                        before or after the event. He recognized the possibility of a leak and
                        thought the public line suggested by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPJ1">Farley</persName> might be the proper one in that case.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> said that the United States
                        had always thought of a quiet visit. There was a good deal of Congressional
                        interest, however, which might lead to the Department being asked whether
                        any American had visited the site. He asked whether arrangements were also
                        being made for others to go to the site, such as British or Swedish experts,
                        pointing out that a special United States-Israel relationship might be
                        desirable. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that
                        the invitation to the United States was in discharge of the specific promise
                        by Ben-Gurion that he would invite someone from the United States.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FPJ1">Farley</persName> should
                        advise the Ambassador directly as to the names of the visitor or visitors
                        whom the United States wished to suggest and as to the acceptability of the
                        time proposed.<note n="1" xml:id="d31fn1">On April 28, the Department

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> informed the
                        Secretary that Prime Minister Ben-Gurion hopes to have an early opportunity
                        to talk with the President to discuss and clarify a number of subjects of
                        current importance to Israel, including security questions and Israel’s
                        atomic energy program. According to the Ambassador, the Prime Minister could
                        make the visit as early as the week of April 23. He has had the possibility
                        of such a visit in mind for some time, but has delayed suggesting it because
                        of his awareness of the heavy demands on the President.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would try to find an opportunity to discuss the
                        proposal with the President, pointing out, however, that at least until the
                        end of the first week of June the President’s schedule is virtually filled.
                        With reference to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>’s
                        suggestion that the visit might be as early as the week of April 23, the
                        Secretary observed that the atmosphere might not be completely favorable for
                        a meeting so soon after the Security Council’s expression of disapproval of
                        Israel’s parade to be held April 20.<note n="1" xml:id="d32fn1">A paper

                    <p>The Secretary added that an official invitation would be difficult because it
                        is the practice to issue them considerably in advance. He observed that most
                        of the many statesmen recently received or who are expected in the next few
                        months were or will be in Washington on other missions.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that this would
                        not be of concern to Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, who would be content if
                        arrangements and circumstances of the visit were decided according to the
                        President’s wishes.</p>

                    <p>During my brief stopover at Dhahran when returning from the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Conference,<note n="1" xml:id="d33fn1">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> attended the

                            Ministerial Council in Bangkok March 26–30.</note> I was greeted by His
                        Highness Prince Muhammad ibn Saud, King Saud’s son and Saudi Arabian
                        Minister of Defense and Aviation, who extended the King’s personal greetings
                        to you. The Prince had traveled some 60 miles to Dhahran to carry out his
                        mission. It is believed that a reply from you to King Saud would be
                        appropriate and a suggested message is enclosed.<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">The White House approved the text of the attached letter, which was
                            transmitted to the Embassy in Jidda for delivery on April 24. (Telegram
                            415 to Jidda; Department of State, Central Files, 611.86A/4–2461) The
                            letter indicated in part that the United States respected Saudi Arabia’s
                            decision regarding the Dhahran Airbase and expressed a willingness to
                            consider any Saudi request to develop suitable arrangements to maintain
                            the current high-level of operational efficiency at the airfield. See
                            Supplement, the compilation on Saudi Arabia.</note> Such a message might
                        be sent to the King through the American Embassy at Jidda.</p>
                    <p>A reply from you to King Saud affords a convenient opportunity to indicate in
                        general terms United States readiness to be helpful to Saudi Arabia in
                        developing arrangements to maintain the high level of operational efficiency
                        at the Dhahran Airfield after the expiration of the Dhahran Airfield
                        Agreement in April, 1962, if the Saudi Arabian Government should desire such
                        further help. There have been intimations that a change of government may be
                        in the offing in Saudi Arabia sometime after the pilgrimage (May 24). This
                        uncertain internal situation may cause the King to conclude that it is
                        inappropriate to respond immediately to any such offer by us. We know,
                        however, that some of the more responsible Saudi Arabian authorities are
                        concerned that they will not be able to operate the Dhahran Airfield alone.
                        We believe, therefore, that the Saudi Arabian Government will in due course
                        be receptive to such an expression of continued United States willingness to
                        assist it at Dhahran. The Department of Defense states that a logistic
                        requirement for Dhahran or, alternatively, some other suitable Middle East
                        site will <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0143"/>continue after April, 1962.
                        Our hope is that in the context of some type of private civilian operation
                        of the Dhahran Airfield which the Saudi Arabian Government may find
                        technically desirable and politically acceptable, continued United States
                        Military Air Transport Service and minimal mission support-type activities
                        at Dhahran might informally be worked out.</p>

                        <item>At Arab League meeting at Shtaura last August, decision was made to
                            establish Palestine “personality” or “entity” with implication of
                            Algerian-type movement designed ultimately to eliminate Israel. While
                            longer range plans include military organization and Palestine

                            beyond standard resolution of previous years. Arabs insisted on
                            reference to custodian proposal in one form or another, finally offering
                            “mild” proposal to effect <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> would in
                            fall give consideration to “establishment of machinery” for protecting
                            Arabs’ property rights. Although negotiations continued most friendly,
                            USG insisted nothing new or substantive should be introduced and sought
                            to offer counter-language to effect that <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> should next fall consider steps in interests “general
                            welfare of refugees”. This unacceptable to Arabs, who promptly had five
                            Moslem powers table their resolution with custodian concept and USG
                            subsequently tabled its amendments seeking to generalize Arab
                            resolution. In Parliamentary ploy Iraq and Libya then proposed
                            sub-amendments which in effect reinserted Arab concepts into US
                            amendments. This is status as show-down approaches.</item>

                        <item>USG believes custodian concept involves all sorts of complications,
                            including legality of interfering in a sovereign country’s right to
                            jurisdiction over property under its control. Cf. Egypt’s assertion of
                            this right is case of Suez. Egypt refused outside custodianship for
                            Canal and it doubtful if Arabs would agree to custodian for Jewish
                            properties left in Arab countries. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.

                        <item>USG bases its position not on merits or demerits of custodian
                            proposal, but rather on propriety and wisdom of introducing an
                            extraneous and controversial issue of this type at this time. Our
                            contention is that Resolution 1456 provided for general review in autumn
                                <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> and that Arab insistence in
                            raising controversial issue is an obvious provocation at precise time
                            when Arab representatives have repeatedly been telling new US
                            administration that present tranquility in Near East should be preserved
                            and no disturbing initiatives undertaken.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>Thus in our view issue is not custodian proposal but question of
                            tranquility in New East. If Arabs choose by this method to upset present
                            calm, they must hold themselves responsible. They aware USG support re

                    <p>On April 17, 1961, Deputy Special Counsel to the President <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Myer Feldman</persName> telephoned Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> about the proposed meeting between
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>. According to the
                        memorandum of conversation, “The Sec returned the call and F said he met
                        with the Pres this afternoon with a man from NY named Abe Feinberg. The Sec
                        thinks he knows him. F said he just returned from Israel and met with
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> and they raised with him what the
                            <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> raised with the Sec—that is the
                        possibility of a meeting between the Pres and <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>. The Pres acting on the Sec’s advice was reluctant but
                        Feinberg said they apparently regard it as extremely urgent. The Pres said
                        he would be in NY on the 27th—he won’t make any announcements of any kind or
                        commitments and assumes no one will—but if <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>
                        happens to be there and he is going to be here at Feinberg’s invitation he
                        will see him the morning of the 28th. The Pres wanted it checked with the
                        Sec. The Sec said all right under those circumstances. The problem was the
                        parade. F said no announcement here or by us—they just happen to be there
                        and meet quietly. F will report to the Pres.” (Department of State,

                    <p>I thought you might wish to have the following summary report on where the
                        Palestine refugee item stands.</p>
                    <p>On April 18 the Arab draft resolution sponsored by five Moslem countries was
                        approved by the Special Political Committee by a vote of 47 in favor, 19
                        against, and 20 abstentions. As approved, this draft resolution contained
                        several changes which were included among amendments which we had proposed.
                        However, the resolution still contains two paragraphs, one preambular and
                        one operative, which refer to the “property rights”, as interpreted by the
                        Arabs, of the Palestine refugees. The pertinent operative paragraph reads:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Recommends</hi> to the General Assembly that at its
                                sixteenth session primary consideration be given to the future
                                welfare of the refugees themselves including the means of
                                safeguarding their property rights.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The United States voted against the two paragraphs on the property question
                        and against the resolution as a whole because we believe that the
                        introduction of the Arab concept that the Palestine refugees have specific,
                        ongoing title to property left behind would immeasurably complicate the
                        already difficult problem of working towards a solution of this refugee
                        question. Assembly approval of this concept, even in the apparently
                        innocuous phraseology the Arabs are now proposing, would serve to stimulate
                        later Arab demands for the appointment of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> custodian in Israel to receive past and current incomes from
                        properties once owned by the refugees.</p>
                    <p>In order that there be a positive alternative for those delegations who did
                        not wish to endorse the Arab property concept, we introduced in Committee
                        our own resolution which noted that the Palestine refugee problem as a whole
                        would be reviewed at the 16th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and which,
                        on the strong recommendation of our delegation, contained the following
                        operative paragraph: <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0148"/>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Believes</hi> that in its consideration of this
                                item at the 16th session, careful consideration should be given to
                                the future welfare of the refugees themselves, including the
                                safeguarding of their rights as set forth in Resolution 194,
                                paragraph 11.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Our resolution was defeated by a single vote, 30–31–15. Incident-ally, the
                        Israelis made strong representations to the Department about the use of the
                        term refugee “rights” in connection with the repatriation or compensation
                        principle set forth in Resolution 194, paragraph 11. We took the position
                        that the word “rights” was fully consistent, in terms of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> language, with the position the Assembly has
                        long held on paragraph 11. In any event, with the defeat of our resolution
                        this question is no longer germane, for we do not intend to re-introduce our
                        resolution in plenary.</p>
                    <p>We have fair reason to hope that in plenary a blocking third will be
                        marshalled against the two undesirable property paragraphs in the Arab
                        resolution. If these paragraphs are deleted, we intend to vote for the
                        resolution; if not, we shall vote against. After the Committee vote, we sent
                        a circular to a number of Embassies, requesting that representations be made
                        to secure support for our position on this property question in plenary.</p>
                    <p>Arab spokesmen and news media are very worked up about our opposition to
                        their ongoing title property concept. We believe that to accommodate
                        ourselves to Arab extremism on this matter now would seriously compromise
                        our ability to assist the parties in finding an eventual solution, and that
                        therefore we must stand firm on our position.<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">At

                    </list>
                    <p>The Secretary made a courtesy call on the Iranian Foreign Minister at 2:15
                        today. He was accompanied by Asst. Secretary <persName corresp="p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WET1">Wailes</persName>.</p>
                    <p>After a brief exchange of greetings, the Foreign Minister launched into a
                        long disorganized discourse on the problems the Iranian Government was
                        having with its students, particularly those overseas. He implied that many,
                        if not most, of the students were Communist or Communist-influenced. Later
                        he seemed to take the view that they were spoiled children of the rich with
                        little to do but have a good time and that when their college days were over
                        they would return to normalcy. He then dwelt at some length on the effects
                        of Soviet propaganda on these students, particularly through the medium of
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. In this connection, he pointed out that
                        there were a number of Egyptian teachers spreading Communism to the Iranian
                        students, particularly in Europe. Furthermore, within the next year a book
                        would be published by Egyptian scholars with local editions in various
                        countries condemning the Shah and the present regime in Iran.</p>
                    <p>Changing the subject, the Secretary pointed out that in his review of the
                        Iranian situation he had noted that about every six months the Iranian
                        Government and the Shah had asked for assurances of United States backing.
                        He asked frankly what the Minister felt was the cause of <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0150"/>these requests. The Minister indicated in
                        his opinion cause number one was the American press, which from time to time
                        had unfriendly and unduly critical articles on the Iranian regime. These had
                        their effect on the Iranian people and the Shah, making them doubt the full
                        backing of the United States. Another reason which he gave was the continued
                        Russian propaganda blasts against Iran which had an unsettling effect on the
                        people. The third reason, which he mentioned briefly, dealt with our aid
                        program and its insufficiency.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary than inquired whether in view of this unrest of students, etc.,
                        as described by the Foreign Minister, Iran’s greatest needs weren’t in the
                        field of economic and social progress rather than military. The Minister
                        agreed in part but also emphasized Iran’s fears of military aggression from
                        neighboring countries, particularly Afghanistan and Iraq, with the more
                        remote possibility of a future danger from Nasserism spreading through the
                        Middle East.</p>
                    <p>In commenting on the Iranian political situation the Foreign Minister said in
                        his opinion his country was not ready for democracy as we envisaged it
                        because the Iranian people had no faith in elected members of their
                        Parliament. One highly critical member recently easily captured popular
                        acclaim by just being different and being against the Government. He pointed
                        out that this was a serious problem for the Shah and one which prevented
                        rapid progress toward democratization. In this context he also pointed out
                        that it was because of these uncertainties that at the present time the
                        Government hesitated to invite <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                        headquarters to move to Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister again referred to the problem of students and pointed
                        out that the British had been of some help through a women’s organization
                        which took an interest in keeping the co-eds busy and out of trouble. He
                        wondered whether there weren’t some organizations in the United States which
                        could take a similar interest in both men and women students, and thus help
                        the Iranian Government with this major problem.</p>
                    <p>As a last point in the conversation, the Secretary expressed more or less in
                        question form the idea that the Iranians should build up enthusiasm in their
                        student body and young people with a view toward stimulating serious
                        interest in the welfare of their country and government. The Foreign
                        Minister’s reply was fairly noncommittal, but indicated that some steps
                        along this line were being taken. The discussion ended with an earnest but
                        unimpressive plea by the Foreign Minister for more aid and understanding on
                        the part of the United States.<note n="1" xml:id="d37fn1">According to the

                        <item>An Approach to the Arab Refugee Problem</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>It is our view that for the following reasons a serious attempt should be
                        made to do something about the Arab refugee problem: a) a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution of April 21 directed the Palestine
                        Conciliation Commission (United States, France and Turkey) to undertake
                        action with respect to the Arab refugee problem and report to the General
                        Assembly by October 15; b) unless progress is made the general review of the
                        refugee problem scheduled at the General Assembly this fall is apt to
                        produce repercussions highly detrimental to the interest of Israel, the
                        United States, and peace in the Near East; c) unless some move is made
                        toward resolving this 13-year-old problem, Congress will not be likely to
                        continue appropriating funds (approximately $23,000,000 annually) as the
                        United States contribution (70%) to the United Nations Relief and Works
                        Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (<gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>); d) the Arab refugee problem is probably the best key to
                        progress on this entire Arab-Israel problem, including such issues as Suez
                        transit, the Arab League boycott, boundaries, and the status of Jerusalem;
                        and e) during the campaign last fall a pledge was made to initiate action
                        designed to facilitate an Arab-Israel settlement.</p>
                    <p>The approach which the Department proposes consists of elements recommended
                        by qualified and unbiased observers over the years. Briefly, it offers each
                        refugee the choice of repatriation as a law-abiding citizen of Israel,
                        resettlement via special works projects in an Arab country, or resettlement
                        via United Nations encouragement in a non-Arab country. The approach
                        assumes, and by careful restriction and phasing assures, that only a
                        fraction of the refugees will in fact return to live permanently in Israel.
                        As a first step, a Special Representative under <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> auspices would carry out a “reconnaissance mission” to
                        Israel and the Arab capitals. The Special Representative, probably a
                        non-American, will be selected in consultation with Secretary General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Arab-Israel question in its various aspects has defied solution for 13
                        years. This effort, if it is to have any chance of success, will require
                        maximum cooperation from all parties directly concerned. The forthcoming
                        visit of Prime Minister Ben-Gurion will afford excellent opportunity <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0152"/>for you to bespeak his cooperation.
                        It is important, however, that <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> activity
                        become public knowledge prior to the Ben-Gurion visit, for otherwise Arab
                        leaders are apt to reject the Commission’s project with allegations that it
                        was “hatched” by you and the Prime Minister in your talks. It may not prove
                        possible to select an appropriate Special Representative and to have him
                        commence his mission prior to the arrival of Ben-Gurion. In that case there
                        could at least be a meeting or two of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> and a subsequent press release or planted story to the
                        effect that the Commission is considering how an impartial approach to the
                        problem might be made and, in this connection, that it is thinking about the
                        selection of an impartial representative to sound out the parties directly
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>As you know, the Arabs already tend to view this Administration as
                        pro-Israeli, particularly because of certain recent developments at the
                        United Nations. Because of the important time factor, I would hope you will
                        be able to give us prompt approval to undertake this approach.<note n="1" xml:id="d38fn1">The points raised in this memorandum were discussed on

                        present Near East situation with some suggested steps for its improvement.
                        The memorandum was prepared in response to a query on your part during the
                        Ambassador’s introductory call. We have reviewed and analyzed this in some
                        detail and have prepared a response to significant points raised in the
                        memorandum. We believe it would not be advisable to attempt a written reply
                        to the Ambassador’s memorandum and that the matter could appropriately be
                        handled by a discussion between myself and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> in which I would inform him you had
                        reviewed the points he had put forward and had asked me to speak on your
                        behalf. If you approve, I would make to him the points listed below, which
                        have been appropriately cleared in other bureaus and in the Department of
                        Defense, as a preliminary to the Ben-Gurion visit.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>’s memorandum is
                        noteworthy in that it speaks favorably of the present tranquillity in the
                        Near East and eschews “frontal and public” approaches to an Arab-Israel
                        settlement. In this connection, it is of interest that Ben-Gurion has
                        publicly stated that an Arab-Israel settlement cannot be imposed. While
                        endorsing this general thesis, which for the Israelis is somewhat of a
                        departure from their previous thinking, the Ambassador in his memo proceeds
                        to set forth a set of proposals which, for the most part, date back to days
                        when the Israelis were not so satisfied with the status quo. Throughout the
                        memorandum there is much emphasis of the theme that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is the root of all evil. This
                        reflects current Israeli and Jewish sentiment which tends to portray
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as some sort of new
                        Pharaoh or new Hitler. It does not take into account that anti-Israel
                        feelings are even stronger in the Arab world outside Egypt than in Cairo and
                        that even were <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to disappear
                        from the scene Arab resentment of Israel would remain undiminished. A
                        schematic analysis of the Israeli memorandum setting out in skeletal form
                        the Israeli suggestions and the pros and cons pertaining thereto is attached

                        <item><hi rend="italic">Quiet Diplomacy</hi>. We are pleased that the
                            Israelis share our view concerning the many “positive aspects”
                            characterizing the present climate of the Near East. As noted in
                            previous exchanges between us, we agree with the Israeli view that a
                            “frontal and public attack” on major outstanding issues would be likely
                            to boomerang but we would not, of course, be averse to steps which could
                            be effective in advancing an Arab-Israel settlement. We have been
                            gratified to note that under the relatively tranquil conditions
                            prevailing during the past year Israel has <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0154"/>continued its phenomenal progress, e.g., exports up
                            25%, industrial growth up 14% (highest in the world), <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> per capita above that of Netherlands
                            and Italy, foreign exchange reserve up over 65%, and even USG aid up
                            from $60 million to $82 million.</item>

                        <item><hi rend="italic">Security Assurances</hi>. We have serious doubts as
                            to the advantages either for the U.S. or Israel of a bilateral Defense
                            Agreement and we question the advisability of a new public statement on
                            the part of the U.S. Government supporting in explicit terms territorial
                            integrity of the Near East states. We do not believe either our allies
                            or the Soviet Union would join us in such a declaration. Such a
                            statement would, in fact, seem to constitute the kind of broadside
                            effort regarding issues in the area which would carry a greater risk of
                            disturbing the existing calm than it would carry promise of aiding
                            progress towards solutions. The Arabs would interpret such a gesture as
                            an American attempt to coerce them into making peace with Israel and as
                            an abandonment of an impartial attitude on the part of the United
                            States. Existing U.S. ties with Israel, our demonstrated opposition to
                            armed aggression as reflected in the Lebanon crisis and Israel’s own
                            military capabilities are significant deterrents to aggressive intent on
                            the part of Israel’s neighbors (Tabs A–1 and B–1).</item>

                        <item><hi rend="italic">Military Aid</hi>. With regard to the arms imbalance
                            feared by the Israelis, we continue to believe that steps which would in
                            effect make the United States the arsenal for Israel would heighten
                            tension in the area and would probably lead to a corresponding step-up
                            of Soviet arms to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Such an
                            intensified arms race with its concomitant economic burdens would be
                            highly detrimental to the countries of the area and dangerous. We are
                            confident that Israel’s military needs can best be served: a) by
                            procurement of its heavy and advanced arms from traditional European
                            suppliers; b) by the occasional sale of modest amounts of defensive arms
                            from the United States; c) by accepting our offer for some $15,000,000
                            worth of advanced electronics equipment (early warning); d) by military
                            training of Israeli officers in the United States at about the present
                            levels; e) by the continued availability to Israel of surplus U.S.
                            matériel; and, f) by continued beneficial contacts with our military
                            attachés in Israel. In this connection, we are gratified by the high
                            regard which our military officers hold for Israel’s military prowess
                            and their confidence that the Israel defense forces will more than match
                            Arab military capabilities for the foreseeable future (Tabs A–2 and
                            B–2).</item>

                        <item>Regional Disarmament. The U.S. is very much in sympathy with the
                            Israeli objective for reducing arms burdens in the Near East but we fear
                            that there is at the moment not much hope of finding a basis for
                            agreement for disarmament or agreed upon arms control in the Near East
                            region. We intend, however, to keep this matter under scrutiny.
                            Prospects for any initiatives would, of course, be enhanced by
                            preservation <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0155"/>of the existing calm
                            and by a cooperative attitude on the part of all the nations which are
                            supplying significant quantities of arms to the Near East countries
                            (Tabs A–3 and B–3).</item>

                        <item><p><hi rend="italic">Arab Refugees</hi>. The United States finds the
                                position of the Israel Government on the Palestine refugee problem
                                somewhat disappointing. At the Lausanne Conference in 1949 Israel
                                spoke in terms of the repatriation of a substantial number of
                                refugees—up to 150,000. Thus, it seems that Israel’s stance on
                                repatriation has retrogressed considerably. The U.S. remains deeply
                                concerned with the refugee problem. There is mounting Congressional
                                impatience with continuance of massive U.S. financial contributions
                                unrewarded by significant progress towards solution. It is also a
                                subject on which Israel and its friends are extremely vulnerable in
                                the annual debates on the <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>
                                item at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly. We
                                do not expect either Israel or the Arabs to sacrifice vital national
                                interest to make progress. However, there is required a willingness
                                on both sides to undertake concessions which seem of significance to
                                the other.</p>
                            <p>The choice of compensation or repatriation has perennially been
                                endorsed by the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. This
                                principle is supported by the U.S. It is difficult to envision real
                                progress until Israel has found some means for dealing effectively
                                with this concept. In recent years Israel has indicated willingness
                                to compensate the refugees, but has done so in the context of
                                rejecting the principle of repatriation. Lacking this element, the
                                sum impression of the Israel position is that the present unhappy
                                situation should endure for a very long time, with the U.S.
                                continuing to bear the brunt politically and economically. For its
                                part the United States would not view as acceptable any arrangement
                                which would disrupt Israel’s economy or prove to be a significant
                                threat to Israel’s security (Tabs A–5 and B–5).</p></item>

                            “Palestine Entity”, with the implied thought of establishment of a
                            “Palestine Government in exile”, is regarded by the U.S. as a
                            retrogressive development in Arab-Israel relations. The Arabs so far
                            have been notoriously unable to develop any agreed course of action for
                            implementation of the Palestine entity idea and a frontal attack by the
                            U.S. on the entity concept is only likely to give it more life (Tabs A–4

                            resolution of the Jordan Waters problem. Meanwhile, it is imperative in
                            our view that Israel in its water development program abide by the terms
                            of the <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan. Because of intense Arab
                            antagonism and threats of hostilities when Israel diverts water out of
                            the Jordan basin, we are on a continual alert for possible indications
                            that a unified development plan can be negotiated by one <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0156"/>agency or another with the parties

                        continuation of impasse is increasingly detrimental to US interests in

                    <p>Late in the evening of May 4, 1961, <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral
                            Burke</persName> directed the Joint Chiefs of Staff Duty Officer to see

                        immediately the text of a message from Tehran reporting that during a
                        teachers strike in Iran, 50,000 demonstrators had clashed with Iranian Army
                        and security forces and that a nationwide strike sponsored by the National
                        Front was possible. General <persName corresp="#p_CCV1">Clifton</persName>
                        read the message at 10:50 p.m., but decided not to waken the President who
                        had retired for the evening. <persName corresp="#p_CCV1">Clifton</persName>
                        informed <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> of this, said that if

                        promised to show the original message to the President first thing in the
                        morning. According to a memorandum by <persName corresp="#p_CCV1">Clifton</persName> written at 11:40 p.m., he also informed <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> that “the President had been worried
                        that things had been happening that he isn’t informed about, and that this
                        looked fairly difficult, so he should be kept posted.” <persName corresp="#p_CCV1">Clifton</persName>’s memorandum, the message from

                    <p>As you know, Arab leaders are concerned about the policies of the new United
                        States administration with respect to their part of the world. In their
                        view, the previous Democratic administration under President Truman was
                        strongly partial to Israel. This no doubt has conditioned their
                        interpretation of certain attitudes we have recently been required to take,
                        e.g. during the recent <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> debate at the
                        General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>We feel the time has come to make clear the desire of this administration to
                        deal with Middle Eastern matters on as fair and friendly a basis as
                        possible. Accordingly we are proposing a letter from you to each of the Arab
                        leaders setting forth the broad lines of this administration’s policy with
                        respect to the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>It is our hope that the proposed letters will be helpful in our launching of
                        the new approach to the Arab refugee problem by the Palestine Conciliation
                        Commission. The letters may also be of some help in mitigating Arab
                        repercussions to the forthcoming visit of Prime Minister Ben-Gurion to this
                        country. In this connection, it will be important to dispatch the letters as
                        far in advance of Ben-Gurion’s May 30 visit as possible.</p>
                    <p>If you approve the attached draft letter, we shall forward the text via our
                        Embassies to: President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> of the
                        United Arab Republic, President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> of Lebanon, King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> of Jordan, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_QGAK1">Qassim</persName> of Iraq, King Saud of Saudi Arabia,
                        and Imam Ahmed of Yemen. We shall accompany the text with special insertions
                        setting forth what the United States has done and is doing by way of
                        assisting each country. The proposed inserts on a country by country basis
                        are also attached.<note n="1" xml:id="d42fn1">The text of the draft letters
                            (with individual inserts) is the same as that forwarded by <persName corresp="p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> on May 5. The copy attached to <persName corresp="p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>’s memorandum was used to record
                            White House changes that were made over the telephone. For this text,
                            showing the handwritten changes, see Supplement, the compilation on the
                            Arab-Israeli dispute. The letters as approved by the White House were
                            transmitted to the various Embassies for delivery on May 11. For the
                            letter from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, see <ref target="#d47">Document 47</ref>. The five other letters were
                            transmitted in telegram 1018 to Beirut (Department of State, Central
                            Files, 611.80/5–1161); telegram 713 to Baghdad (ibid.); telegram 837 to
                            Amman (ibid.); telegram 299 to Taiz (ibid., 711.11–KE/5–1161); and
                            telegram 430 to Jidda (ibid., 611.80/5–1161).</note></p>

                    <p>Mention in the draft letter of previous American Presidents is based on the
                        fact that still today these Americans are venerated and idealized in the
                        Arab world. Not infrequently Arab leaders will in conversations with
                        Americans refer to these past great Presidents, usually with the implication
                        that the United States is straying from the high principles which these
                        historic figures had enunciated.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the recent United Nations debate concerning <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, we have numerous reports that the Arab
                        delegates in New York have misrepresented our attitude to their home
                        governments, principally to avoid the onus for their own lack of success. As
                        a result there are indications that a special meeting of Arab Foreign
                        Ministers may soon be convened with a view to discussing the alleged “new
                        anti-Arab attitude” on the part of the United States. The letter from you
                        should be quite helpful in tempering such Arab discussion. It might in fact
                        lead to some sort of collective Arab response, which would at least have the
                        merit of maintaining contact with the Arab world. It is also conceivable
                        that this exercise could lead to a meeting between you and some Arab
                        spokesman, e.g. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, for the
                        purpose of exchanging views.</p>
                    <p>We have little doubt that news of these letters will leak to the press, here
                        and in the Near East. We will not recommend publication of the letters, but
                        if the recipients should ask that publication be permitted we would
                        concur.</p>
                    <p>I hope you will be able to approve this proposal. In our view a move of this
                        type is needed. Arab attitudes toward us at the United Nations and elsewhere
                        have not been helpful and it would be hoped that these letters would
                        reassure Arab leaders of this administration’s earnest desire to maintain
                        and enhance friendly and fruitful relations between their countries and
                        ours.</p>

                        of Israel’s request for the “Hawk” missile and the pros and cons of making
                        it available to Israel.</p>
                    <p>I could detect in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> very
                        little personal desire to deny the “Hawk” to the Israelis, whose professions
                        of vulnerability to surprise air attack he seems to accept at face value. He
                        remarked that if the political objection to their delivery to Israel were to
                        be removed he would be prepared to review the classification problems, which
                        he obviously does not regard as insuperable.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_GRAEBJ1">Grantham</persName> remarked that it
                        might be difficult to deliver them to the Israelis and continue to decline
                        to make them available to the Pakistanis and the Iranians, both of whom have
                        requested the weapon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>
                        replied that there are two differences: (1) the Israelis have the technical
                        competence to master their use in very short order, which is not true of the
                        Pakistanis and the Iranians; and (2) the Israel deal would be a sale,
                        whereas our <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> friends would expect
                        them as gifts.</p>
                    <p>We discussed the cost of the missile, and I pointed out that the $50 million
                        estimated original cost would fall on the United States one way or another.
                        Furthermore, we are averse in principle to large-scale arms transactions in
                        the Middle East. I pointed out that our largest previous sale to Israel had
                        a ceiling of $1 million.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> made much of the fact that
                        the “Hawk” is a purely defensive weapon and he was not particularly
                        impressed, as far as I could see, with our arguments that, regardless of its
                        defensive character, it would mean the introduction of an advanced type of
                        weapon technology <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0163"/>that all other
                        governments of the Middle East would want immediately in equivalent or more
                        lethal form.</p>
                    <p>I left the meeting with the conviction that if the President, following his
                        conversation with Ben-Gurion, asked a reassessment of the request for the
                        “Hawk”, responsibility for resistance will rest completely with the
                        Department and we shall receive no support from Defense for reasons of
                        national security or classification.</p>

                        Arabs to view new US administration as partial to Israel. However, President
                        did not believe he should refuse request even as he would not wish refuse
                        request should an Arab leader desire visit US unofficially. Moreover,
                        President hopes capitalize on opportunity to emphasize USG views re need to
                        move forward with respect to Arab refugees and also re Israel’s nuclear
                        reactor.</p>
                    <p>Before question of Ben-Gurion visit arose, Department had been considering
                        letters from President to individual Arab leaders setting forth in broad
                        terms desire of new US administration to deal with Near East problems in as
                        fair and friendly manner as possible. It was hoped that letters would
                        reassure Arab leaders of USG impartiality in Arab-Israel issue and USG’s
                        desire to maintain friendly and mutually beneficial relations with all Near
                        Eastern states.</p>
                    <p>Also Department has independently reached conclusion that serious effort must
                        be made between now and next <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> with
                        respect to Arab refugees. Present plans call for reconnaissance mission to
                        Near Eastern capitals by distinguished non-American official as Special
                        Representative of <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>. He would hear views
                        of leaders and then recommend to <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>
                        measures to resolve refugee impasse using <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0165"/>resolutions as basis. While
                        realizing intractability this problem, Department convinced that determined
                        effort must be undertaken.</p>
                    <p>Department keenly interested in any measures which will minimize adverse
                        reactions to Ben-Gurion visit in Arab world. It is hoped Presidential
                        letters, cast in warm friendly tones, will be helpful. Department assumes
                        such letters should be delivered well before news of Ben-Gurion visit
                        becomes public. Department also assumes it preferable get <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> activity re refugees under way before
                        Ben-Gurion talks with President, otherwise Arabs apt to allege <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> move “hatched” by Ben-Gurion and President
                        in their talks.</p>
                    <p>Department wishes your comment on means for minimizing Arab reactions to
                        Ben-Gurion visit and specifically whether it would be worthwhile to give key
                        Arab leader in your country advance indication that Ben-Gurion visit will
                        take place. This could be done by reference in President’s letter along
                        lines last two sentences of paragraph 2 above. It might alternatively be
                        done orally on or about May 18.</p>
                    <p>Since President’s letter will include support for <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> steps vis-à-vis refugee problem, it possible that if
                        Ben-Gurion included among recipients of President’s letter and if it is
                        known to Arabs that he also a recipient, his visit might be interpreted by
                        Arabs as prompted by unhappiness over <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>
                        move. This would be one possibility for cushioning Arab reactions. Comment
                        on this alternative also requested.</p>

                                solve problems confronting him. Although Shah’s position had
                                deteriorated during past twelve months and although he probably
                                appointed <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> reluctantly
                                and out of some measure of fear at turn of events, he remains focal

                                subordinate; therefore, we should neither identify US Govt with a

                                supporting him against the Shah. We believe, however, we should be

                                from us is financial assistance, which he has already mentioned,
                                which he almost certainly will need and which we should give him in

                                    Meeting serious consideration be given to other steps such as
                                    sponsoring military representatives meeting of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                                    alliances and, much more importantly, informing <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> regional countries that US
                                    has plans providing for allocation of nuclear weapons outside of
                                        <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> area for use in
                                    support of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> forces in
                                    event of hostilities with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                                    Iranian pressures for military aid would be increased rather
                                    than reduced by US accession to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. We believe Shah attaches value to US
                                    accession primarily as a means of acquiring more military
                                    aid.</p>
                                <p>Aside from problems which would be created in other parts of this
                                    area by formal US treaty guarantee Iranian borders, there is
                                    also problem of making clear to Iran’s neighbors that we mean by
                                    such guarantee only Iran-Soviet borders and not those with
                                    Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan. We are not only unsure that
                                    US guarantee of Iran’s borders would reduce pressures for
                                    military aid but we have doubts that offer plus ensuing debates
                                    here, in Washington, and elsewhere during ratification processes
                                    would be welcomed by Iranian people. They might well consider
                                    that economic and social problems far outweigh whatever security
                                    problems might be met by such guarantee. What will help in this
                                    connection is conviction on part of Shah that US remains as
                                    serious as it has ever been about defending this country against
                                    Soviet encroachments. His conviction in this regard has been
                                    shaken by what he has heard in recent months from other than US
                                    official sources about prospective US policies. It will probably
                                    be restored only with time, patience, and continued sincere
                                    demonstrations of good will on our part toward him and his
                                    regime.</p>

                                    believe is not of sufficiently high priority on any grounds to
                                    justify large outlay at time when other Iranian demands on aid
                                    funds are apt to grow very large.</p></item>

                    <p>“May 11, 1961. Dear Mr. President: In recent months the world’s attention has
                        been centered on several explosive situations, the outcome of which could
                        spell the difference between freedom and servitude, between peace and war,
                        for many millions of people, ultimately perhaps for all mankind. I know that
                        you have been deeply concerned about these problems, as I have been.
                        However, I am confident that you share with me the conviction that through
                        the dedicated efforts of men of good will everywhere, the storm clouds of
                        the present can be dispersed.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, leaders responsive to the needs and aspirations of their peoples
                        must, in my firm opinion, be alert to every possibility for advancing <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0171"/>basic principles of political and
                        economic justice. Thus, while since my inauguration on January 20 I have
                        perforce been largely occupied with the several international crises of
                        immediate concern, I have given considerable thought to other international
                        issues that deserve the careful attention of us all.</p>
                    <p>My thoughts have often turned to the Middle East, an area which has
                        contributed so much to the religious and cultural heritage of the world
                        today, and whose potential for further rich contributions to civilization is
                        great. As an American I am proud that the concepts of our founding patriots,
                        of <persName>Abraham Lincoln</persName>, <persName>Woodrow Wilson</persName>
                        and <persName>Franklin Roosevelt</persName>, have played so great a part in
                        the emergence of vigorous, independent Arab states, respected as sovereign
                        equals in the international community.</p>
                    <p>I am proud of the tangible encouragement which has been accorded by our
                        government and people to the aspirations of you and your countrymen in the
                        past, particularly during the critical days of 1956. The United States
                        Government, itself the product of a union of several independent states, was
                        pleased to recognize the formation of the United Arab Republic on February
                        22, 1958, the birthday anniversary of our own first President,
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>In recent weeks I have noted some speculation as to the direction of the
                        policies of the new United States administration with respect to the Middle
                        East. Let me assure you that the concepts inherited from the men mentioned
                        above are part of the very fiber of this nation, and that as its President I
                        intend to uphold them. You will find us at all times and all places active
                        in the struggle for equality of opportunity; for government of the people,
                        by the people and for the people; for freedom from want and fear; and for
                        the application of justice in the settlement of international disputes.</p>
                    <p>Translating these great precepts into United States policy in the Middle East
                        for the next few years, I want you to know that: <list>

                    <p>While tensions unfortunately have sharpened in certain other areas of the
                        world, the Middle East during the past three years has been relatively
                        tranquil. This has been due largely to statesmanship on the part of the
                        area’s leaders who have given priority to constructive programs of economic
                        development. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and I have
                        been struck by the unanimity of views expressed to us by representatives of
                        the various Middle Eastern states emphasizing that the present relative
                        tranquility be preserved.</p>
                    <p>Underlying tensions do, however, remain, not the least of which is the
                        unresolved Arab-Israel controversy. I know deep emotions are involved. No
                        easy solution presents itself. The American government and people believe
                        that an honorable and humane settlement can be found and are willing to
                        share in the labors and burdens which so difficult an achievement must
                        entail, if the parties concerned genuinely desire such participation. We are
                        willing to help resolve the tragic Palestine refugee problem on the basis of
                        the principle of repatriation or compensation for properties, to assist in
                        finding an equitable answer to the question of Jordan River water resources
                        development and to be helpful in making progress on other aspects of this
                        complex problem.</p>
                    <p>I am pleased that the United Nations General Assembly recently underscored
                        the necessity to implement more rapidly its previous recommendations on the
                        refugee problem. In this connection, I wish to state unequivocally that this
                        Government’s position is anchored and will continue to be anchored in the
                        firm bedrock of support for General Assembly recommendations concerning the
                        refugees, and of active, impartial concern that those recommendations be
                        implemented in a way most beneficial to the refugees.</p>
                    <p>The United States, as a member of the Palestine Conciliation Commission and a
                        nation keenly interested in the long-range advancement of the peoples of the
                        Middle East, takes seriously the task entrusted to the Commission by the
                        United Nations. We are determined to use our influence to assure that the
                        Commission intensify its efforts to promote progress toward a just and
                        peaceful solution. What precise steps the Commission may be able to take
                        are, of course, not yet clear, but I can assure you that there will be no
                        lack of United States interest in seeing that effective action is taken. It
                        is my sincere hope that all the parties directly concerned will cooperate
                        fully with whatever program is undertaken by the Commission so that the best
                        interests and welfare of all the Arab refugees of Palestine may be protected
                        and advanced.</p>
                    <p>With reference to relations between the United Arab Republic and the United
                        States, I recognize that our views on important problems do not always
                        coincide. At the same time I am pleased that mutually beneficial <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0173"/>relations continue to exist in many spheres
                        and that United States assistance in significant quantities has played a
                        role in your own thorough and detailed development program. As you know, I
                        have recently made proposals to the Congress for aiding in the preservation
                        of Nubian monuments.<note n="3" xml:id="d47fn3">Reference is to President

                        commodities to the United Arab Republic since we recognize the importance of
                        an adequately nourished population. It is my earnest hope that such mutually

                        wish to remain free, I want to be certain that you and other Arab leaders
                        have no misunderstanding of our attitude towards the Arab people. It
                        continues to be one of sincere friendship. With mutual respect for the

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is a key Arab leader.
                        The Department has periodically considered the possibility of an official
                        visit by him to this country. Because of the Palestine problem and Egyptian
                        dependence on the Soviets for military and economic assistance as well as
                        sales of cotton, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s political
                        orientation has favored Moscow, which he has visited on several occasions.
                        Privately, however, he retains great interest in, and respect for, the
                        United States. An official visit here by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> might thus afford significant advantages, including
                        (a) catering to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s “dignity”
                        (Sulzberger’s column (enclosed)<note n="1" xml:id="d48fn1">Not
                            printed.</note> in the April 3 <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>
                        also makes this point); (b) affording a relatively inexpensive opportunity
                        for the U.S. to do something to counter the influence the Soviets have
                        acquired through their assistance and cotton purchases; and (c) both before,
                        and hopefully after, such a visit, inducing a less antagonistic attitude
                        towards us on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s part (Nehru’s
                        visit here several years ago has had something of this effect). <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reception in New York during the
                        United Nations General Assembly in 1960 came as a pleasant surprise to him
                        and resulted in a brief improvement in the atmosphere. A longer visit would
                        build on this favorable start, but it should be emphasized that no major or
                        fundamental reorientation of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
                        thinking is to be expected. Maintenance of reasonably stable relations with
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>, and establishment of a cordial
                        personal relationship between yourself and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will establish a climate in which Soviet Bloc errors
                        in its dealings with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> may well
                        become more expensive politically to the Bloc (but probably not to the
                        extent that this has been true in India).</p>
                    <p>In the past, anti-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> sentiment in
                        this country, fear of alienating our allies, notably King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and the Shah, and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s own behavior have militated
                        against an official visit. However, new elements in the situation suggest a
                        fresh look might be taken at this question. These include: (a) the fact that
                        there is a new administration in Washington <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0175"/>without a record of prior actions on Near Eastern matters
                        which might complicate a visit later on; (b) the Near East has been
                        relatively tranquil in recent months, creating a more favorable atmosphere
                        for a visit; (c) tension between <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        appears recently to have eased, and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> seems to be more interested than formerly in a role
                        as a constructive Arab leader; (d) <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>-Tunisian differences have similarly been reduced; and (e)
                        the assignment of a new U.S. Ambassador affords an opportunity for an
                        initiative.</p>
                    <p>A particular problem is presented by outstanding invitations which <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has to visit Cuba, Mexico, Brazil
                        and Venezuela. There are unofficial indications that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may visit some of these countries in
                        the fall, perhaps in connection with a trip to the next United Nations
                        General Assembly. While <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> might
                        be reluctant to compromise the possibility of an official visit to the
                        United States by visiting a Castro-ite Cuba at the same time, our new
                            Ambassador,<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> appointed <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">John S. Badeau</persName> as Ambassador to the
                            United Arab Republic on May 29. He presented his credentials on July 19.
                            Information relating to <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>’s
                            appointment, which was recommended by Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>, is in Department of State,

                            March 1961.</note> if authorized to allude to the possibility of a
                        United States visit, would have to obtain an understanding that a <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> trip to Cuba either immediately
                        before, after or otherwise in conjunction with a visit here would be
                        unacceptable. The Ambassador’s allusion to a U.S. visit would, of course,
                        avoid either the form or the substance of a commitment.</p>
                    <p>Outside events continually arise which have an important impact on
                            U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> relations. For this reason,
                        it would be advisable not to extend <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> a formal invitation for a visit here far in advance
                        of the suggested time for the trip. Accordingly, we believe considerable
                        latitude will be needed to assure that, in arranging a <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit, we take advantage of special
                        circumstances which may arise. At the same time, we believe it would be
                        helpful for hints about such a visit to be dropped to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in the near future. In this way,
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s desire to make an
                        official visit here may be turned to our advantage by encouraging him to
                        adopt a more moderate attitude on such questions as Cuba where extremism
                        would obviously render an official visit out of the question.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing considerations, we suggest that you approve the
                        following preliminary recommendations with a view to an eventual visit here

                        <item>With regard to other recommendations of a military nature,
                            specifically, paragraphs II.5, III.10, and III.11, the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff are ready to cooperate wholeheartedly in these proposed studies.
                            However, it should be noted that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for military
                            reasons, have gone on record recommending the United States join <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. Further, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            consider it timely to advise you that the present approved contingency
                            plan for Iran (<gloss target="#t_CINCNELM1">CINCNELM</gloss><gloss target="#t_OPLAN1">OPLAN</gloss> 215–60) is based, in part, on the
                            assumption that should US forces become overtly engaged with the armed
                            forces of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, general war will
                            exist and general war plans will be invoked. Viewed in the context of
                            the foregoing assumption, recommendations II.5a, and III.11 might be
                            construed as major revisions of current military policy. Such a
                            connotation is misleading without a detailed supporting military study.
                            In the absence of such a study at the present time, the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff desire to withhold concurrence in so much of the recommendation in

                            employed. Subject to the foregoing remarks, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            concur in the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force for

                    <p>The thrust of this report is that we must vigorously support the new
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government as the best, and
                        perhaps last good chance of forestalling Iran’s slippery slide into chaos.
                        The demonstrations in Teheran on 2–4 May have made not only the Shah but the
                        State Department face up at last to this alarming trend.</p>
                    <p>All Task Force members agree that <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s moderate reformist program offers the only good
                        alternative to an unpopular military dictatorship or a Mosadeqist
                        revolution. Even the Shah claims to fervently support <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> for these reasons. Thus his advent
                        provides an opportunity which we must seize.</p>
                    <p>However, <hi rend="italic">the gut issue was how far we should really go in
                            supporting <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName></hi>, and even
                        risk the Shah’s displeasure by pressing him to do the same. The Embassy, and
                        some State officers, felt that <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>
                        might represent just another reformist interlude, and that the Shah would
                        begin to undercut him (as he has previous prime ministers) once the Shah had
                        recovered from his case of nerves. State has perennially been reluctant to
                        press the Shah very hard, with the result that not much has been
                        accomplished.</p>
                    <p>But the Task Force consensus is that with Iran now pretty far down the road
                        to chaos, we had better do everything feasible to give the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> “experiment” a fighting chance,
                        helping to protect him against pressures from both the Shah and the left.
                        This represents a significant change in policy.</p>
                    <p>The Task Force has come up with a pretty good action program to this end. It
                        is oriented more toward economic needs and social reform than toward paying
                        the Shah military baksheesh again (see pp. 1–5 of Report): <list>

                            <item>Iran faces a “cash” crisis. Though it occurred largely through

                            government, which came to power on 6 May, introduces a new element.
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Ali Amini</persName> is a
                            well-known critic of the Shah and recent governments, and a proponent of
                            evolutionary reform for Iran. He owes his present position to the fact
                            that the Shah was convinced that in the crisis <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> was the only man acceptable to
                            the military, the nationalists, and the conservatives, and therefore
                            able to prevent the situation from deteriorating further. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s announced program includes a
                            strong campaign against corruption, and for political, administrative,
                            fiscal, and judicial reforms, and implementation of the land
                            distribution law.</item>

                        <item><persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s most urgent problem
                            will be to maintain this acceptability while achieving sufficient
                            authority as Prime Minister to cope with the financial and
                            administrative mess he has inherited and the touchy political and legal
                            problems created by dissolution of the Majlis (Parliament) and pressures
                            for early elections. He will also be confronted with greater public
                            expressions of discontent made possible by certain concessions toward
                            freedom of the press and assembly which he has made. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> is an effective administrator and
                            has a wide range of personal contacts among political and military
                            leaders, though no organized political following. His character suggests
                            that he will make a more serious effort than his predecessors to avoid
                            subservience to the Shah and to carry out his program.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The Shah was apparently frightened by the recent crisis into
                            delegating considerable authority to <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>, although he has sought to retain close control of
                            the armed forces. The Shah probably regards this delegation as only
                            temporary, since he strongly believes in the necessity of concentrating
                            power in his own hands. He is extremely skillful at manipulating
                            factions and leaders, and no Prime Minister since <persName corresp="#p_MM11">Mossadegh</persName> has been able to stand up to
                            him. Should <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> be able to
                            stabilize the situation sufficiently to enable the Shah to recover from
                            his present fright, the latter will move to resume the dominant
                            position. If he concluded that he could no longer exercise such
                            domination, he might abdicate and leave the country rather than become a
                            mere figurehead.</item>

                        <item>Barring a military coup which might oust either the Shah or <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> or both, it is highly probable
                            that sooner or later their present uneasy collaboration will develop
                            into a struggle for power between them. It is impossible at present to
                            estimate the duration or outcome of such a struggle.</item>

                            However, it contains a number of conflicting factions and ideologies.
                            Many of the junior and middle level officers, and probably a few of <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0184"/>the top ranks, are sympathetic
                            to the kind of reforms included in <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s program. On the other hand, the upper echelons
                            of the officer corps have a vested interest in the status quo, which is
                            necessarily threatened by such reforms. Although they acquiesced in
                                <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s appointment, they are
                            already apprehensive regarding the trend of events.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The nationalists, who have become increasingly active politically
                            during the last year, will also be a key factor, although they too
                            represent a variety of points of view. The more radical of them will
                            almost certainly oppose <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>
                            from the beginning. Some of the moderates may work with him as long as
                            they retain hope that he will move toward their objectives. One of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s major problems will
                            be to acquire enough support among urban nationalists to weaken their
                            capability to apply pressure against the regime as they have done in the
                            past eight months. A major source of friction in <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s relations with the nationalists
                            will be the timing and conduct of the elections.</item>

                        <item>The Iranian Communist Party (the Tudeh) is not now a major political
                            factor. It has been hard hit by <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>
                            and almost all of its leaders are in jail or exile. For the next year or
                            so, at least, it is not likely to try to come out in the open as it did
                            in 1953, but probably will become more active in trying to penetrate
                            nationalist groups. In the event of sustained political disturbances, it
                            would probably be able to reconstitute itself and might emerge as a
                            major force.</item>

                        <item>External factors could also have a significant effect on the Iranian
                            scene. US support will be an important asset for <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>, but only if it is given in such
                            a way as to avoid his being widely labeled as “merely an American tool.”
                            Most military elements would probably seek to sound out US reaction to a
                            takeover by them before acting.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>Communist propaganda is already attacking the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government, claiming that it is
                            merely a US creation designed to shore up the corrupt regime of the
                            Shah. The Soviet Union probably feels that, if the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> regime is quickly discredited and
                            falls, the trend toward a revolutionary upset in Iran would be
                            accelerated. However, should the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government show strength and staying power, the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might experiment with a softer
                            line, offering economic aid and possibly some political concessions,
                            such as a revision of the Irano-Soviet treaties, in return for a
                            loosening of ties with the West.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>One thing is clear to date: the appointment of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> represents a significant step
                            toward liberalization of the government. Should <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> be able to develop an independent
                            position and implement a major reform program, the chances of
                            evolutionary development toward more stable and representative
                            government in Iran would be enhanced. If, on the other hand, the Shah
                            should attempt to force <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>
                            into a puppet’s role, or should replace him with some politician
                            subservient to the throne, the unrest which brought <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> to power would be likely to <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0185"/>break out more violently than
                            ever. Likewise, a sharp turn to the left by the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government would provoke a strong

                            during the next year or so are greater than they appeared to be when
                                <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 34–61 was written (February
                            1961). However, we cannot predict whether or when such a coup will
                            occur. A coup could take a number of forms: a movement against <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> by traditional conservative
                            elements in the officer corps; a coup by more progressive senior
                            officers against the Shah to support <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>; or a military coup simply to end indecisive
                            squabbling among the Shah and civilian politicians. Such coups would not
                            necessarily involve the elimination of the Shah, but might result in a
                            major reduction in his personal powers, in which case he might abdicate.
                            Any of these coup governments might stabilize the situation temporarily;
                            however, they would probably lack popular support, would almost
                            certainly be plagued by factionalism, and would be subject to increasing
                            pressure from nationalists and the Tudeh.</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>There is the additional possibility of a radical nationalist
                            government coming to power as the result of a coup based in the lower
                            and middle officer ranks or of large-scale civil disturbances in which
                            important army elements in effect joined the demonstrators. It too would
                            probably be ridden with factionalism, and internal instability would be
                            likely to continue. A swing toward radical social and economic measures
                            at home and neutralism in foreign policy would be virtually
                            certain.</item>

                    <p>Messrs. U.M. Staebler and J.W. Croach, the United States scientists permitted
                        to visit Israel’s Dimona reactor responsive to our suggestions <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0186"/>that such a visit would be helpful in
                        allaying international concern, have returned from their visit. On Thursday,
                        May 25, they discussed their findings with officers of the Department of
                        State.</p>
                    <p>Their written report will be available very soon.<note n="1" xml:id="d53fn1">Not found.</note> In the meantime, it is of general interest that they
                        were received with cordiality and permitted to visit the several
                        installations which are engaged in nuclear research, including the reactor
                        at Dimona. They report themselves as satisfied that nothing was concealed
                        from them and that the reactor is of the scope and peaceful character
                        previously described to United States officials by representative of the
                        Government of Israel.</p>
                    <p>The two scientists were informed that Israel’s decision to expand nuclear
                        development beyond the laboratory research stage was taken in 1957 with the
                        appointment of a committee, which first considered and then rejected because
                        of its expense the establishment of two large reactors for production of
                        industrial power. Instead, it selected the program which it is now pursuing,
                        i.e., the construction of a research reactor which can provide experience
                        for scientific and technical personnel in essentially all of the problems
                        posed by a power reactor. The present center was conceived as a means for
                        gaining experience in construction of a nuclear facility which would
                        eventually prepare them for the production of nuclear power. They have
                        chosen natural uranium as fuel because of a desire to be able to produce as
                        much as possible of it from their own vast potash resources. Ground was
                        broken for the plant in 1959.</p>
                    <p>It might be desirable to bring the following tentative conclusions and
                        opinions of the scientists to the President’s attention, prior to his May 30
                        meeting with Prime Minister Ben-Gurion: <list>

                            <item>From the standpoint of keeping abreast of the reactor’s
                                development and ascertaining that its purpose continues to be
                                non-military, a second visit would not be necessary before another
                                year.</item>

                            <item>Israel’s obsession with secrecy is regrettable, but perhaps
                                understandable in view of Israel’s physical and political
                                circumstances. Israel’s reasons for secrecy include: (a) a possible
                                boycott by the Arabs of manufacturers on whom Israel depends, (b)
                                proximity of the reactor to international borders with vulnerability
                                to sabotage, and (c) conviction that Arab awareness of Israel’s
                                scientific capability would not be in Israel’s national
                                interest.</item>

                                weapons, there is no present evidence that the Israelis have weapon
                                production in mind.</item>

                        the President’s letter is “very important”, and opined cautiously that some
                        measure of progress on Palestine might be envisaged provided the U.S. is
                        really prepared to be firm and fair.</p>

                        Israel, and Arab fears of Israel’s atomic research program. The usually
                        moderate Lebanese President commented, however, that even if all these
                        issues could be resolved, deep Arab hostility to Israel, a state established
                        at Arab expense by armed force supported from abroad, would remain.</p>

                        declaration, and such a declaration would have more of a disturbing than a
                        stabilizing effect. It might invite Arab approaches to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Moreover, it is doubtful that we could
                        persuade either our allies or the Soviet Union to join in a multilateral
                        declaration. With regard to the Hawk Missile, this would introduce a new,
                        dangerous and very costly phase in an already desperate arms race. When
                        Israel obtains the French Mirage Fighter it will have a combat plane
                        superior to the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-19.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> will urge reduction of

                    <p>We will examine the possibilities, but there seems to be little prospect of
                        agreement with other major powers upon an arms control program. For the
                        Soviets to join in such an arrangement, they would undoubtedly insist that
                        the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> countries be included. This is
                        not feasible from the United States point of view.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> has assured us that
                        Israel’s new reactor at Dimona is utilized solely for peaceful purposes.
                        However, he may urge that the growing Arab threat would leave Israel with no
                        alternative but to develop a nuclear military capability.</p>

                    <p>Our findings, resulting from the visit of Dr. Croach and Dr. Staebler,
                        confirm the peaceful purposes of the reactor advertised by the Israelis. But
                        we should seek similar visits at frequent intervals. If the Israelis merely
                        give the appearance of having decided to embark upon the production of
                        fissionable material and weapons manufacture, it might set off violence
                        resulting from an Arab mood of desperation. We must oppose concealment of
                        Israeli intentions because of the unsettling effect of this reactor in a
                        highly volatile part of the world.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> is unlikely to raise
                        this question, but this question is a major element in continuing
                        Arab-Israeli tensions. The United States has contributed approximately $260
                        million to support the refugees and continues to pay about $25 million a
                        year.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The United States position</hi></p>
                    <p>If the refugee problem is solved, it could break the log-jam to general
                        Arab-Israeli peace. We support the approach by the Palestine Conciliation
                        Commission. This consists of (a) a reconnaissance mission by a <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> special representative; and (b) a
                        practical, phased program of repatriation, resettlement and compensation
                        which can be worked out without endangering Israel’s security. Ultimately
                        refugees would be offered 3 choices: (a) repatriation, (b) resettlement in
                        special work projects in Arab countries, and (c) resettlement, with United
                        Nations encouragement, in non-Arab countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> would have difficulty with the
                        repatriation alternative, but it should be explained that no one would be
                        repatriated without a careful screening, so that Israel’s security would be
                        protected and only limited numbers would be repatriated annually under a
                        careful phasing operation. If we can get Israeli assurances of acceptance of
                        the principle of choice—either now or to the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> special representative when he visits Israel—this would be
                        a solid break-through toward peace in the Middle East.</p>

                        water for the Negev is the key to Israel’s future and that Israel is
                        planning to divert a portion of the Jordan River by 1963 along the lines of
                        the <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan allocation. The Arabs are threatening
                        both military action and diversion of the headwaters of the Jordan. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> would urge that an
                        equitable solution would allocate the Jordan River to Israel and the Yarmuk
                        to Jordan.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Our answer</hi></p>
                    <p>We believe the Jordan Valley’s future lies with a unified development plan
                        along the lines of the <persName>Eric Johnston</persName> recommendations.
                        Substantial, largely unpublicized assistance has been given Israel for water
                            <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0191"/>development, $45 million since
                        1958. Jordan has received $6 million in the same period of time. We do not
                        consider <persName>Johnston</persName>’s effort implied a moral, political
                        or financial obligation on the part of the United States. Rather, it is
                        basically a responsibility of the riparians. We might suggest (a) an open
                        statement by Israel of its intention to stay within the
                            <persName>Johnston</persName> allocation to help reduce tensions, or (b)
                        mediation by <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. The de facto solution
                        suggested by <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> allocating
                        the Jordan River to Israel and the Yarmuk to Jordan is not equitable. It
                        would deprive down-stream Arab users of that portion of the Jordan River
                        legitimately theirs.</p>

                    <p>After an exchange of amenities, in which each expressed his pleasure at
                        meeting the other, the President and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> plunged into a discussion of
                        Israel’s Dimona reactor. The President said he was glad that two American
                        scientists had had an opportunity to visit the reactor and had given him a
                        good report of it. Since some nations are disturbed at the prospect of the
                        construction in Israel of a large reactor, with plutonium producing
                        capability, the President suggested that—“on the theory that a woman should
                        not only be virtuous but also have the appearance of virtue”—our problem is
                        how to disseminate information about the nature of the reactor in such a way
                        as to remove any doubts other nations might have as to Israel’s peaceful
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said he wanted to talk about the reactor in the context of
                        Israel’s problems.</p>
                    <p>The greatest of these problems, and an almost insoluble one, he described as
                        Israel’s serious shortage of fresh water. Even when the Jordan River is
                        effectively tapped there will not be enough fresh water for the southern
                        part of Israel, he added. The only solution to this continuing shortage that
                        Israel could discern is desalinization of sea water, a process that is
                        technically possible but would be economically practicable only if very
                        cheap power were available. Israel hopes that atomic power, which is now
                        expensive, will become much cheaper and will make possible the economic
                        desalinization of sea water. It had therefore consulted <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0195"/>with Dr. Bhabha of India and with
                        scientists from England and had followed the suggestion that Israel should
                        gain the necessary scientific knowledge to take full advantage of the coming
                        age of nuclear power. In building the Dimona reactor for this purpose the
                        Prime Minister acknowledged that Israel had received assistance from
                        France.</p>
                    <p>Israel’s main—and for the time being, only—purpose is this, the Prime
                        Minister said, adding that “we do not know what will happen in the future;
                        in three or four years we might have need for a plant to process
                            plutonium”.<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">Presumably plutonium produced in
                            the Dimona reactor could be processed in France, in the United States or
                            in Israel. This multiplicity of processing opportunities would increase
                            the difficulty of effective supervision. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note></p>
                    <p>Commenting on the political and strategic implications of atomic power and
                        weaponry, the Prime Minister said he does not believe that Russia wants to
                        give atomic capacity to Egypt now but he does believe that “in ten or
                        fifteen years the Egyptians presumably could achieve it themselves”.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that while the Prime Minister’s estimate might be
                        correct, we do not want by our own actions to increase tensions in the
                        Middle East. He explained that the United States is much involved with
                        Israel in the Middle East and it is to our common interest that no country
                        believe that Israel is contributing to the proliferation of atomic weapons.
                        It is obvious, he added, that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would
                        not permit Israel to go ahead in this field without getting into it
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked again whether, as a matter of reassurance, the Arab
                        states might be advised of findings of the American scientists who had
                        viewed the Dimona reactor. In reply, the Prime Minister said, “You are
                        absolutely free to do what you wish with the report. If you feel you should
                        publish it, we have no objections.”</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his appreciation of the Prime Minister’s willingness
                        to agree to this action. He added that of course the United States is
                        sometimes suspect in matters dealing with Israel, “because we are close
                        friends”, and asked whether it would not be helpful to let neutral
                        scientists also observe the reactor. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben
                            Gurion</persName> asked who are really neutrals these days? The
                        President commented that although <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> says that no man is neutral, there are, after
                        all, such neutrals as the Scandinavians and the Swiss. The Prime Minister
                        said he would have no objection to this. The President expressed his
                        satisfaction at the Prime Minister’s reply. He was pleased he could feel
                        that Israel would agree to going ahead with this.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> then raised
                        the question of Israel’s security. The deficit is increasing in Israel’s
                        arms as compared to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0196"/>military equipment, he said; the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has more planes and tanks and now
                        they have 200 Russian instructors. This means that while the gap in quantity
                        is growing the gap in quality is being narrowed. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s declared aim, the Prime Minister added, is to
                        destroy not just to defeat Israel. “If they should defeat us they would do
                        to the Jews what Hitler did”. He asserted also that the Arabs do not value
                        human life and that this makes the problem more difficult.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> referred to
                        his visit last year with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3"><persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> met with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> on March 10, 1960, at the
                            White House; see <ref target="frus1958-60v13#pg_280"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1958–1960, vol. XIII, pp.
                                280</ref>–<ref target="frus1958-60v13#pg_288">288</ref>.</note> On
                        that visit he had asked the United States for weapons—especially for
                        defensive weapons, because the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has 26
                        air fields and Israel has only four. Before leaving Washington he had asked
                        whether he could leave the United States with the assumption that he would
                        get the weapons, and had been told “that is a fair assumption”. (Presumably
                        the Prime Minister was referring to Hawks.) He said he still does not see
                        why Israel cannot get these weapons. He felt it is in the best interest of
                        the United States for Israel to have defensive weapons.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that he had not found records which permit a firm
                        conclusion about what had been committed by the previous Administration, but
                        that the problem, as we see it, is that while the Hawk is a defensive weapon
                        it is also a missile and should missiles come into the Middle Eastern area,
                        military weaponry will escalate fast. This is a problem, he said, to which
                        we will continue to address ourselves, because we do not want to see Israel
                        at a disadvantage. But we are reluctant to introduce missiles into the
                        Middle East; the other side might then introduce ground-to-ground missiles.
                        He repeated that if Israel were faced with a critical break-through of
                        weapons on the other side, we would have our views of what to do. But we
                        will need a better understanding of the danger and we hesitate to be the
                        ones to introduce missiles into the region.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister explained that he was not asking for these weapons on the
                        basis of a commitment made by the previous Administration but on the merits
                        of the case. Acknowledging this, the President observed again that what we
                        are concerned about is introducing missiles into the region.</p>
                    <p>There followed a brief discussion of tanks and planes available to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and to Israel, with figures taken from the
                        briefing book that the President had at hand. The Prime Minister said that
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has 300 fighters, with 200 more they
                        could call upon from other Arab nations. Israel has ordered 60 Mirages from
                        the French. The first of these may be <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0197"/>delivered by the end of this year but it will take more
                        than 12 months for them to be delivered in full. Commenting on the
                        performance capability of the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> 19, the
                        President observed that we cannot eliminate the hazard but we would not want
                        Israel to get into such a position of inferiority that an attack on it would
                        be encouraged. The Prime Minister again suggested that the Hawk, a defensive
                        weapon, would be the best way to avoid this danger at the present time and
                        that it could not threaten any other country.</p>
                    <p>Summing up this aspect of the conversation, the President said that the Hawk
                        had been given to only a few other countries and that if it were introduced
                        into Israel the next development on the other side might be an air-to-ground
                        or ground-to-ground missile. He said we will watch this matter with care and
                        added, “You don’t feel that this is a satisfactory answer to your request,
                        but you can be assured that we will continue to watch the situation.”</p>
                    <p>Turning to another subject, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben
                            Gurion</persName> commented that now the President was going to see

                            identified.</note> If a joint declaration like those of 1956 and 1960
                        could be issued by the President and Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> the Prime Minister felt it would be helpful.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what in the Prime Minister’s judgment would be the
                        response of Arab countries to such a declaration. To this the Prime Minister
                        answered that several small countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq would
                        accept the declaration gladly because they would feel it would protect them
                        against <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The President then
                        asked whether Russia would be likely to do anything now to displease
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> called this unlikely but added
                        that if <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would be willing
                        to do this it would help stabilize the situation in the Middle East. The
                        President suggested that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        probably would object to this declaration, because he thinks that the
                        present borders between Israel and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        are not fixed and he asked whether in this circumstance <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would be likely to accept such a
                        declaration. The Prime Minister doubted that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would do this but commented that it would be a
                        test to see whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> is
                        really interested <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0198"/>in relaxing world
                        tensions. The President observed in this connection that he thinks <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> is pushing hard on many
                        issues.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed interest in the Prime Minister’s views of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s relations with Russia. These are
                        very close, <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> answered.
                            “<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is not a Communist, but
                        he relies on Russia and gets Russian support to get into Africa. The African
                        leaders are not Communists either—even Sekou Toure—but they are
                        pro-Communist. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is working very
                        hard in these countries. His efforts help bring the Russians into them
                        also.”</p>
                    <p>On a broader front, the Prime Minister said he does not believe there will be
                        a hot war. The American people don’t want war, nor do the Russian people.
                        Agreeing, the President observed that nevertheless the danger is there. The
                        Soviet Union wants to push us out of Berlin. We cannot permit the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to destroy the Atlantic Alliance and we
                        cannot permit ourselves to be forced out of Berlin, he said. If we should be
                        forced out of Berlin Europe would no longer associate itself with us in
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. And then, the Prime Minister
                        added, you would be forced out of Europe. Yes, the President said, and then
                        back to our own shores. But we don’t intend that to happen.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> pointed out
                        the United States accepted the status quo but the Russians do not. “The
                        Russians think you are doomed, and they say so.” The President responded
                        that one can argue that systems in many countries may be doomed but not the
                        people, adding, “I can say that doom would be hastened if we were to be run
                        out of Berlin. What interest would you have in a guarantee from us if we let
                        ourselves be pushed out of Berlin?” The Prime Minister responded again that
                        a guarantee of Middle East borders would provide a test case of Soviet
                        intentions. To this the President replied that he was not sure our security
                        problems are not as great as Israel’s. The Prime Minister saw in the two
                        situations the difference that “we are the only remnants of a people that
                        have been fighting for survival for the past 4000 years. If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> defeats us, we are destroyed.”</p>
                    <p>The President asked the Prime Minister for his estimate of current tensions
                        in the area of Israel. The Prime Minister responded that the borders are
                        more or less quiet; there has been a little worry about Aqaba but the
                        Secretary General has reassured him that everything was quiet there.
                        Nevertheless the dangers remain in such places as Jordan and Iraq where
                        regimes depend upon the life of a single man. They are much more worried
                        than we are, the Prime Minister said, because <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> can send someone to assassinate one man whereas in a
                        democracy everybody would fight. Even Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey are afraid of
                        what might happen. Such a declaration as he had suggested would, in the <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0199"/>Prime Minister’s view, give more
                        confidence to all the smaller Arab and other Middle East peoples.</p>
                    <p>The President asked the Prime Minister’s views of the Palestine Conciliation
                        Commission, explaining that as the Prime Minister knew, the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> (of which the United States is a member) is
                        obliged to make a report in the fall of 1961. The President expressed the
                        hope that there may be an opportunity there and asked how the Prime Minister
                        felt about it. The latter recalled that in 1953 President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had sent a messenger named
                            <persName>Anderson</persName><note n="7" xml:id="d57fn7">Reference is
                            presumably to the <persName>Robert Anderson</persName> mission of
                            1955–1956.</note> to make two exploratory trips in the Middle East. At
                        first <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was agreeable to the
                        suggestions that were evolved but the minute he discovered that Israel was
                        serious about them he changed his mind. “All questions in the Middle East
                        depend upon <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.”</p>
                    <p>The President said he thought we have to assume that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will make our lives as difficult as
                        possible, and the Prime Minister agreed, unless some pressure is generated
                        among his people for peace.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that all the people in the uncommitted world are
                        watching the U.S. and other Western countries. For these people, freedom
                        does not mean what it does to us. What makes an impression is better
                        standards of living and health and education. It is not just money they
                        want; they want to feel that they are treated as human beings. This is why
                        Israel is working with Africans. “If you will succeed with the Peace Corps
                        idea—with Americans going out not as superior human beings but to help
                        others—this psychological factor will be more important than the large
                        amounts of money you give away.”</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then described how Israel has brought Asians and Africans
                        into its population and has made its Army an educational institution, which
                        is of great interest to other countries such as Ghana that are trying to
                        develop themselves. He spoke of the Afro-Asian Institute in the University
                        where Asians and Africans are taught cooperation and of other programs that
                        attract many people to learn in Israel. Hundreds of Indians are also coming
                        to Israel, he said, although Nehru will have no relations with Israel. He
                        regretted Nehru’s attitude on this point and said that his excuse is that he
                        wants to make peace in the area. “It is not for me to judge him. He is a
                        great man. I admire him. There is democracy in India; it is the only country
                        in Asia which is democratic except Japan. If Nehru goes I am not sure what
                        will happen; but now it has democracy.”</p>
                    <p>Continuing his comments on the general world situation, the Prime Minister
                        observed that the only imperialistic country that exists now is Russia,
                        which keeps under its domination many Muslim countries in <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0200"/>Asia, former parts of China and many
                        countries in Europe. Yet in the war of propaganda they win because they go
                        against the status quo in other countries. Unless the West can provide what
                        other countries need, we will lose.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the subject of the Palestine Conciliation Commission, the
                        President stated that its new efforts need a sympathetic hearing because if
                        they fail we may get a “Troika” commission. The United Nations is trying to
                        get a neutral representative who will in turn make the proposal which will
                        involve the three alternatives of repatriation or compensation with
                        resettlement in the Arab countries or elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>In response, the Prime Minister commented that any commission would be likely
                        to fail in this effort. “They—the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and
                        any Arabs—don’t care what happens to people. They regard the refugees as the
                        best weapon at hand. If they could get hundreds of thousands of Arabs into
                        Israel we would have those and still be surrounded by many millions of other
                        Arabs.” He then recapitulated the events immediately following Israel’s
                        independence when after several quiet days the Arabs left Israel in large
                        number and in succeeding months Israel had to accept many hundreds of
                        thousands of Jewish refugees from other countries. He also stated that
                        Israel has absorbed as many Jewish refugees from Arab countries as they have
                        absorbed Arab refugees from Israel.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that maybe the Arabs would not agree to any realistic
                        plan than the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> might put forward but if
                        so we would rather have the responsibility of disagreement on them. We are
                        likely to have our troubles with our Congress if the US continues paying 70%
                        of the <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> costs for caring for
                        refugees. If it appears that Israel is constructive, it will make the
                        problem easier.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, it is always worth trying”, the Prime Minister responded. “But until
                        there is peace between Israel and the Arabs I don’t see much chance of
                        success.”</p>
                    <p>The President said that although we had been attacked by the press in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> on Cuba and other matters, we want
                        to do our best to see if this <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> effort can
                        succeed. The Prime Minister recalled the recent Bandung Congress at which
                        representatives of many states, including Communist China, attacked the U.S.
                        He said that Israel had sent the U.S. information about this Congress about
                        the way the people think and speak.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the President said that the conversation had covered several
                        topics: on missiles, “I expressed a desire to continually review the missile
                        situation. We are reluctant to give Israel missiles and you understand that,
                        but we would be disturbed if Israel should get into a situation that would
                        invite attack. We will keep the matter under continuing review in our
                        Administration, I can assure you.”</p>
                    <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0201"/>
                    <p>On the question of the security guaranty, “I’ll see what the atmosphere is.
                        We guess that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> will not
                        wish to lessen the tension. We will have to feel our way through this. The
                        problem probably will be that we won’t get agreement on various issues. If
                        we should, we might try to get an agreement limiting arms to all Africa
                        also.”</p>
                    <p>Before ending the conversation, the Prime Minister said he wished also to
                        take note of the fact that Israel has good relations with Persia and Turkey.
                        Turkey is the more stable and can take care of itself. In Persia there is a
                        very difficult situation; while the people are monarchists, there is
                        corruption and much difficulty. It would help if the U.S. could give them a
                        little more help and encouragement. In response the President said that we
                        and the previous administration have devoted more attention and effort to
                        Iran than to almost any other country in that region. Iran has a large Army.
                        During the recent riots some of our people had questioned whether the Army
                        would support the Shah. There has been a good deal of corruption and there
                        are even stories about the royal family. However, the President thought that
                        this government represented the last best hope and we will do everything to
                        support it. We are for this government and the new Prime Minister 100%. The
                        Prime Minister said he was delighted to hear this.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion the President recalled his previous conversations with the
                        Prime Minister. He wanted the Prime Minister to know that we wish relations
                        between our two countries to be close and harmonious and that we want to be
                        helpful in the Middle East. It was for this reason that he had recently
                        written to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.<note n="8" xml:id="d57fn8">See <ref target="#d47">Document 47</ref>.</note>
                        Responding, the Prime Minister assured the President that he does not hate
                        Arabs, that he regards them as human beings and that “we want you to help
                        them.” The President expressed his feeling that we want to maintain some
                        influence with them.</p>
                    <p>As the Prime Minister rose to leave he handed to the President, as a gift, a
                        book written in Latin, published in 1680. This book, he said, was a record
                        of a visit to the Holy Land by the author, Radzivilli, who was a forebear of
                        Prince Radziwill, the husband of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>’s sister-in-law. Accepting the book with gratitude,
                        the President said he was going to the christening of the Radziwills’ child
                        in London next week and, with the Prime Minister’s permission, would present
                        this book to the child.</p>
                    <p>The President and the Prime Minister parted with mutual expressions of
                        respect.</p>

                            Attached to a May 31 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt
                                Rostow</persName>, indicating that this memorandum was written in
                            response to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>’s query to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> on whether the United
                            States might be able to deal more successfully with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in light of the apparent
                            improvement in U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> also noted that the
                            memorandum printed here took the position that although there had been
                            some recent improvement in U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            relations, the improvement was more one of atmosphere than substance.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> concurred with <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>’s conclusion that “we are on the right

                    <p>Regarding the inquiry which you indicated you had received from the White
                        House as to whether current indications of an improved atmosphere in
                            U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> relations might make it
                        possible for us now to deal with President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, the following information regarding recent and
                        planned initiatives in U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> relations
                        may be helpful.</p>
                    <p>There has been an undoubted improvement in the atmosphere in recent weeks,
                        stemming largely from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> need for
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 wheat, President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s gratification at the President’s
                        recent letters and cordial talk with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> Ambassador and mounting evidence of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>-Soviet friction. The pendulum in
                            U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> relations is thus now
                        swinging again in our direction. So far, however, this is a question of
                        atmosphere rather than substance, prompted in part by factors over which we
                        have no control, notably tensions in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>-Soviet relations and a reduction in inter-Arab friction. No
                        significant modifications of substantive <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> positions have yet occurred. With many of these, notably
                        Cuba, the Congo, the Arab boycott and Israeli Canal transit, we disagree.
                        Nor has there been any modification in the fundamental realities which form
                        the framework of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> relations with the
                        West and the Soviet Bloc. The Arab-Israel question, U.S. inability to
                        purchase Egyptian cotton and continued <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> dependence on the Soviet Bloc for large-scale military
                        and economic assistance heavily circumscribe what can be done to develop a
                        more fruitful U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> relationship, and
                        we have no illusions that any broad understanding is possible. In this
                        context, <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0203"/>any effort to exert
                        unilateral U.S. pressure on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        for quick solutions of central problems, such as the Palestine issue, would
                        most likely: (a) undo the limited progress already made in improving
                            U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> relations; (b) force the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> to express renewed support for
                        extremist Arab positions; (c) render it more difficult for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> to adopt a more balanced role on world
                        problems such as the Congo where the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>
                        has not always been unhelpful; and (d) afford further opportunities for
                        Soviet exploitation.</p>
                    <p>Faced with the foregoing realities, we have concluded that, while it is not
                        now feasible to expect significant help from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in solving major international problems, much can be
                        done to push the pendulum of U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>
                        relations more in our direction. Embassy Cairo concurs in this general view.
                        According to Embassy despatch 894 of May 8,<note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2">Despatch 894, May 8, is entitled, “Evaluation of the U.S. Aid Program
                            in the United Arab Republic.” (Ibid., Central Files, 786B.5–<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/5–861)</note> “In the short run, the
                        basic positions of the Regime on international issues are not subject to
                        much change, but the violence with which they are expressed and promoted
                        might be reduced”. Accordingly, we have felt that our best course is to
                        continue constant probing of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> on
                        important issues like Cuba and the Congo while fostering personal contacts
                        with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his senior advisors
                        and continuing modest economic assistance. This policy is designed: (a) to
                        demonstrate U.S. sympathy for the massive challenges of industrialization
                        and over-population facing the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>; (b)
                        to make clear that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> need not rely
                        fully on Communist Bloc assistance; and (c) to develop a U.S. position which
                        will permit timely exploitation of Soviet errors and periodic tensions in
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p>While conveying an impression of modest yet friendly cooperation with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, this policy has
                        been designed to create uncertainty in Cairo as to our ultimate intentions.
                        Specific requests to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> have been
                        avoided which might give him the renewed impression that we need him more
                        than he needs us.</p>
                    <p>Pursuant to this general posture, the following specific steps have been
                        initiated since March 1: <list>

                    <p>In the foregoing terms we are now dealing effectively with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> with modest success. The
                        President’s letter on the refugee problem has prompted preliminary favorable
                        comment in Cairo, and it has been indicated that we may receive a
                        constructive reply. This reply and Mr. Lodge’s account of his talk with
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> should give us additional
                        information as to how <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        currently views U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reply letter on
                        Cuba was well-received at the White House and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> Ambassador has been informed that the President will be
                        sending <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> another letter
                        following the Vienna meeting. We believe this would afford a most useful
                        opportunity, not only to get our version of the President’s talk with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> ahead of the Russian version, but
                        also to set forth how the new administration views the threat which the
                        non-aligned countries actually face in the coming decade. A draft along
                        these lines will be prepared as soon as possible after the President’s
                        return from Europe.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has, of
                        course, been active in organizing a “summit meeting” of some non-aligned
                        governments. A preparatory, largely procedural, meeting at the Ambassadorial
                        level will convene in Cairo on June 5 to determine the date, place and
                        agenda for <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0205"/>the main conference.
                        Preliminary guidance has already been sent to our field posts and more
                        detailed information is in preparation. Since the June 5 meeting will be
                        largely procedural and the President will be sending another message to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> soon after his
                        return from Europe, we consider that the further Presidential message to
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, in advance of the June 5
                        meeting, might be regarded in Cairo as evidence of undue U.S. nervousness
                        regarding its outcome.</p>
                    <p>Recent U.S. initiatives have made clear to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> our interest in more cordial personal contacts. A <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> request for massive <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 wheat assistance in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-62 is now before us. We conclude that these
                        developments, unless complicated by some unrelated occurrence such as last
                        year’s “Cleopatra” picketing case,<note n="8" xml:id="d58fn8">Reference is

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> thanked the several
                        Ambassadors for being willing to come to the Department together.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said he believed the
                        assembled Arab representatives might be interested in his recollections of
                        the May 30 meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York between
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>, at which he had been
                        privileged to be present.<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">See <ref target="#d57">Document 57</ref>.</note> The meeting had been at Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s request. The
                        President had acceded, as he undoubtedly would to the request of any
                        friendly Prime Minister visiting this country unofficially. The President
                        had indicated that he would not be able to see Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> in Washington but could see him
                        in New York on his way to Europe. The President’s meeting with the Prime
                        Minister had no agenda; it provided an occasion to review informally
                        questions of interest to either or to both.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> recalled that, as the
                        meeting got underway, the subject of Israel’s atomic energy research program
                        came up. The President expressed an interest in the purposes of this
                        program. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>
                        gave assurances that it was for peaceful purposes only. He said Israel is
                        concerned about sources of energy, particularly in the light of its serious
                        problem in creating cheap power for the desalinization of water in which it
                        is so interested. After consulting with international authorities, Israel
                        had concluded that by starting intensive research in atomic energy now, it
                        might hope eventually to apply atomic power relatively cheaply to the
                        desalinization of water. The President expressed deep concern that there be
                        no proliferation of atomic weapons since this would constitute a danger to
                        peace; the United States would have to use its weight against such a
                        proliferation. The Prime Minister renewed his assurance, and the President
                        expressed satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> then expressed concern
                        regarding the added tension in the Middle East which could result from the
                        build-up of arms in the area. The Prime Minister remarked that some
                        countries in the Middle East are receiving arms from “the other side”. In
                        reply, the President said very forcefully that disputes within the area
                        should be resolved by peaceful means. He remarked that the United States
                        does not wish to become involved in an arms build-up in the area.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> stated that the President
                        next told Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>
                        that the United States is committed to the United Nations resolutions on the
                        Palestine refugees, and that the United States will support efforts of the
                        Palestine Conciliation Commission in preparation for the latter’s required
                        report to the 16th General Assembly session.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> remarked that some of those
                        present might have seen an article in the <hi rend="italic">New York
                            Times</hi><note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3">The article appeared on June 2.
                            Circular telegram 1927, June 2, described the relevant portions of the
                            article as follows: “<persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>
                            is quoted as having ’large measure of agreement’ with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> on Arab refugee
                            problem. At departure interview, <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben
                                Gurion</persName> said he had found ’understanding’ on nettling
                            issue of refugees adding that ’in no way was I disappointed.’ <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> was quoted as saying
                            President had offered ’a suggestion that might be a solution.’ <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> added he did not know
                            whether ’this’ would be acceptable to Arabs but if it was acceptable ’it
                            would be a solution.’ Article describes President’s ’suggestion’
                            as’simultaneous repatriation and resettlement of the refugees.’” The
                            telegram also sent the text of the U.S. response. (Department of State,
                            Central Files, 784A.13/6–261)</note> reporting Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s interpretation of his

                        on the question of refugees. Or perhaps those present might have learned of
                        the Department’s reply later in the day in response to a newsman’s question.
                        The text of the Department’s reply had been as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“On May 9 the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine
                                issued a communiqué reporting that it had met that day to consider
                                steps which could usefully be taken in the fulfillment of its
                                responsibilities pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 1604 (XV)
                                of April 21, 1961, and relevant previous resolutions. These
                                resolutions envisage the resolution of the Palestine refugee problem
                                through repatriation or compensation. The United States Government
                                has consistently supported these resolutions and will fully support
                                moves made by the Commission in accordance with them.</p>
                            <p>“In their brief, informal meeting in New York, the President raised

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that this statement by
                        the Department accorded with his recollection of what transpired during the
                        meeting. (At the request of the assembled representatives, copies of the

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that, concluding his

                            Gurion</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> had reiterated that the United States is very much
                        concerned with the welfare of all the Middle Eastern states; <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0208"/>that this concern is the firm basis of
                        United States policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said
                        that at the end of the conversation there had been some talk of a book
                        presented to the President by the Prime Minister. The President had said he
                        was very glad to have this gift, that in London he was going to the
                        christening of a descendant of the author of the book, and hoped Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> would agree to
                        its being given to the child. The Prime Minister had assented.</p>
                    <p>The conversation between the President and the Prime Minister had begun at
                        4:45 p.m., immediately after the President’s arrival in New York, and had
                        ended about 6:10, when the President left to dress for a speech at a cancer
                        fund dinner.</p>
                    <p>The Saudi Arabian Ambassador said the press had reported that Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had raised with the
                        President Israel’s hope of obtaining from the United States and the Soviet
                        Union a guarantee of its borders. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that he did not know the origins of this
                        report. Except for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPEG1">Salinger</persName>,
                        whose remarks following the President’s meeting had been reported in the
                        press, no one on the United States side had talked to the press about the
                        meeting. Therefore, these comments must either have been manufactured or
                        come from other sources. It was true that in referring to his fears of an
                        arms build-up in the Middle East Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> might have implied a suggestion of what the Saudi
                        Arabian Ambassador had in mind. However, the President had not taken this up
                        or suggested in any way that this could be a basis for action by the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador of Iraq inquired as to <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben
                            Gurion</persName>’s statement to the <hi rend="italic">New York

                        refugee problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied
                        that, as indicated by the Department’s statement, the President had referred
                        to <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> resolutions regarding the refugees
                        and had expressed the hope that Israel would cooperate in any effort
                        undertaken by the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> in response to these
                        resolutions. The Ambassador of Iraq asked whether Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had agreed with the President.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that, from what he
                        remembered, and with reference to the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>,
                        the Prime Minister had said, “It’s worth a try.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said he could inform those present
                        in great confidence that the Department hopes that in activating the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>, United Nations Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName> will find someone from a
                        neutral country to make a survey of the refugee situation as a basis for a
                            <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> report to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Iraqi Ambassador asked if President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> had been satisfied with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s assurances regarding Israel’s atomic reactor.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said the President had
                        expressed his satisfaction with these assurances.</p>
                    <p>The Lebanese Ambassador asked if the United States intends to make clear
                        publicly its support of <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> resolutions
                        regarding the Arab <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0209"/>refugees. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that, as
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DN2">Dimechkie</persName> is aware, the
                        Department uses the vehicle of a statement to the press, such as that by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WLP1">White</persName> earlier in the day, to make
                        its policies known to the public.</p>
                    <p>The Iraqi Ambassador asked whether, in connection with his expressed
                        apprehension over an arms build-up in the Middle East, Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had sought arms
                        assistance from the United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> commented that he had recalled earlier in the meeting
                        as accurately as he could exactly what had been said during the President’s
                        meeting. While Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben
                            Gurion</persName>’s actual statements had dealt with Israel’s fears, he
                        had perhaps implied something more. Perhaps the Prime Minister might have
                        pursued these inferences at the meeting which had been scheduled with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> for May 31. However,
                        other unrelated developments had obliged the Secretary to cancel this
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Iraqi Ambassador asked whether this particular question of arms
                        assistance had been pursued by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>
                        replied that the Department had not yet received a report of that
                            conversation.<note n="5" xml:id="d59fn5">See <ref target="#d60">Document
                                60</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>The Ambassador of Lebanon asked whether it could be understood that neither
                        arms nor a border guarantee had been discussed seriously between the
                        President and <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that he thought it
                        very clear from his earlier comments that the President had made no response
                        to several things hinted at by <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben
                            Gurion</persName>. Certainly, it was fully clear that <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had left without any U.S.
                        involvement in these matters.</p>
                    <p>The Sudanese Ambassador asked whether Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had discussed the reasons for
                        secrecy regarding Israel’s second reactor. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that he had not. It was the President who had
                        raised the question of Israel’s atomic research programs, and he had done so
                        not in terms of history but in terms of the present and of future
                        intentions. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben
                        Gurion</persName>’s assurance on peaceful uses was firm.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Chargé asked whether so-called
                        restrictions on Suez Canal transit had been discussed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that they had not.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador of Lebanon said the press had implied that <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> wanted the President to take up
                        Middle East questions with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                        seeking some sort of agreement to keep the Middle East out of the cold war.
                        Was there such discussion? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>
                        replied that, as he had suggested before, the Prime Minister had tended to
                        imply something of this sort. The President did not encourage him in this
                        line.</p>
                    <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0210"/>
                    <p>The Ambassador of Lebanon said that in both the present instance and in the
                        case of the meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> last year the Israel Prime Minister had seen the
                        American President just before the latter was to meet with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that he could not speculate on Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s motives in timing
                        his visit as he had. He had asked to come. While President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> already knew he was going to
                        Europe, to the best of his (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>’s) knowledge the President did not know that he would
                        be seeing <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> at the time
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s visit had first been
                        discussed.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Chargé asked if the question of
                        Algeria had been discussed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said it had not.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Chargé asked whether Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had spoken to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> of the results of his
                        visit to Canada. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied
                        that if Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had
                        made any reference to his Canada visit, it had only been to preface certain
                        of his remarks to the President with, “As I said in Canada”.</p>

                    <p>3238. Palestine refugees. <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName>
                        talked with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> June 1.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> made emphatic
                        representation that US feels Israel should accept repatriation of Arab
                        refugees and feels it unrealistic expect Arabs accept resettlement as only
                        solution. He further enlarged on possibility of practical phased program,
                        with balanced repatriation, resettlement and compensation, which would not
                        endanger Israel’s security.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> expressed equally emphatic
                        disagreement and said that with repatriation <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will send his army into Israel behind refugees;
                        refugees would repatriate only with support of Egyptian army. He further
                        expressed view Arabs will not accept three points of emigration,
                        repatriation and resettlement. He also rejected view that once psychological
                        barrier represented by acceptance, i.e. principle of repatriation, <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0211"/>broken, it would not take place in
                        large numbers, and resettlement in Arab and non-Arab lands would follow.</p>
                    <p>He added Jordan and Lebanon ready live in peace with Israel now, but Egypt
                        called the turn in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> ambitions win all of Arab world
                        could only be accomplished by destroying Israel.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> repeated familiar position
                        that only by peace settlement can repatriation and resettlement be
                        achieved.</p>
                    <p>He added prospects for peace would be increased if <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would guarantee all of <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> boundaries, and that ultimately peace will follow if Israel
                        continues its effective work in non-Arab countries. Egypt will have make
                        peace to maintain its position in such countries.</p>
                    <p>Teddy Kollek pointed out repatriation problem now centered in 250,000
                        refugees in Gaza Strip who had no other hope. He added <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> more open minded than on arrival
                        (presume he meant willingness cooperate with <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CMS1">Comay</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> for opportunity discuss
                        possibilities of repatriation and resettlement further on <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName>’s return from LA. <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> had feeling he and Kollek, at
                        least, were impressed with difficulties in Congress and changing attitude in
                        this country.<note n="1" xml:id="d60fn1">On June 13, <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> reported that, in a recent
                            conversation, Israeli diplomat <persName corresp="#p_AS6">Arad</persName> had told U.S. officials that Israel had noted the
                            marked difference between what President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> had said to <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben

                            U.S. officials responded that the two conversations were complementary
                            and reflected an identical policy. If Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had been able to meet with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>, he would have

                            <item>Again I agree but must point out that it would be most dangerous
                                to let army get involved in politics or politics involved in army.
                                With army loyal to me and under my direction, I was able to dissolve
                                Majlis twice recently and to make necessary changes in the
                                government. If army were subservient to Cabinet or Majlis, this
                                would have been impossible. Army will remain under my personal
                                control and <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> appreciates
                                situation and has no desire to have it otherwise.</item>
                            <label>(D)</label>
                            <item>I cannot entirely agree that internal political conditions have
                                direct relationship to size of expenditures of army. This is true if
                                the expenditures are at expense of such public programs as health,
                                education and welfare. It is not true if assistance for military
                                increments comes from U.S. Everything, therefore, depends on U.S.
                                aid and I cannot spend more for the military from our budget than I
                                am now doing. If your current year’s help is less than $28 million,
                                there will have to be a cut in the armed forces. Only way to
                                effectively offset a cut is in modernization of equipment. Likewise,
                                if there is a cut in U.S. aid, why is Iran the only ally getting so
                                little attention militarily. All I need is modernization and a
                                moderate sized army to stop the possibility of local wars. Egypt,
                                for <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0214"/>example, spends $400
                                million on its army in addition to military equipment. Iraq has
                                received $500 million in equipment from the U.S. and spends annually
                                $100 million on armed forces which on the basis of populations would
                                mean $400 million for Iran. Because of the bilateral in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, we can obviously afford to get
                                along with less. While there is room for discussion on size of army,
                                I must urge, if Iran is to help protect itself, we must receive
                                modern military equipment.</item>

                                must make it quite clear that if Iran is to remain free and if I am
                                to remain in Iran, it will not be possible if the Tudeh party or
                                fringe groups or connections come into control. We will continue for

                    <p>Shah was calm and serious during our conversation and I felt had little to
                        criticize in “home truths” presented to him with exception of paragraph D
                        relating to army. In discussing this year’s military assistance I said I
                        still couldn’t give him figure but I had no reason to think it would be as
                        much as $28 million. I added, however, that I believed everything was being
                        done to get this money to him promptly and that this in itself would be a
                        major benefit even if the amount were smaller.</p>
                    <p>At no time during the conversation was there the slightest indication that
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> was other than his personal
                        choice and a person in whom he had confidence and to whom he was prepared to
                        give his full backing as long as the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government followed the line of close alliance with
                        the West, no compromise with the Soviet Union, and was prepared to do the
                        best job in promoting stability and economic progress in Iran.</p>

                    <p>I have read carefully the memorandum you forwarded from <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> on prospects for dealing with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d63fn1"><ref target="#d58">Document 58</ref>.</note> I understand very well that
                        in working with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, we are now
                        working within narrow limits; and I did not have in mind that there was any
                        possibility of getting <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to look
                        at the world with Washington’s eyes on the many specific matters in which we
                        are at cross-purposes.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, my impression is that the tone of that memorandum may be
                        over-cautious; and its suggested courses of action may lead to our missing
                        some opportunities.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, I sense from current intelligence that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is worried about three things:
                        Syria; his economic position in general; and his over-commitment to Moscow
                        economically, which is leading Moscow to exert on him quite severe and overt
                        political pressure. We can help him to a degree on all three fronts.</p>
                    <p>I conclude that it would be worth exploring with him the possibility of
                        substantially expanded long-term economic arrangements within the framework
                        of his plan and our foreign aid program—quite apart from the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 business now in hand. The quid pro quo
                        for which I would look is not an “improved atmosphere in U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations.” I am very skeptical of
                        bargaining economic aid directly for such short-run atmospherics. The
                        objective of getting closer to him on a long-run economic basis, as I see
                        it, would be to strengthen the foundations for his independence and to build
                        up a whole range of more intimate human contacts with his people. Our
                        experience with India has indicated, for example, that one is likely to
                        accumulate more short-run political benefits from this kind of
                        approach—which does not explicitly tie aid to diplomatic positions—than from
                        trying to balance at every stage along the way. I would hope, for example,
                        that without much explicit bargaining we could expect over a period of time
                        to temper <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s activities a bit
                        in Libya, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, etc., if he were to go with us on long-run
                        development on an enlarged scale.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, if we decided, in the wake of Vienna, to reply to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s last long letter, we may wish to
                        say some things about our view of neutralism <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0216"/>and non-alignment that bear on the forthcoming conference.
                        The subject matter of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
                        letter—which I found interesting—gives a good opening.</p>
                    <p>As you know, I do not regard myself as a Middle East expert. My only firm
                        conclusion is that we want a paper that argues some of the issues beyond the
                        present memo.<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">A brief June 7 note from <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>, attached to the source text, reads: “<persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> remains unconvinced.

                                even if nothing concrete came of it. As a very important wheel in

                                make him less obstreperous at the September neutralist confab. Ergo,

                    <p>“Excellency:</p>
                    <p>“Ever since assuming the duties of Secretary of State, I have wanted to send
                        you a personal note to tell you how much I look forward to working with you
                        again in my new capacity. You know better than I the burdens of a Foreign
                        Minister and will therefore understand why this pleasure has been deferred
                        until now.</p>
                    <p>“While the Near East area has been relatively tranquil in recent months, I
                        have been aware since my appointment of Arab concern regarding reports in
                        the last few months of Israel’s atomic development plans. As Your Excellency
                        knows, the United States Government has steadfastly opposed any
                        proliferation of nuclear weapons capabilities. Accordingly, when your
                        Ambassador called on me on February 7,<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">See <ref target="#d9">Document 9</ref>.</note> I assured him that the United
                        States Government had welcomed public Israeli statements that their new
                        reactor is intended exclusively for peaceful purposes. I stressed that we
                        intended to continue our vigilance and opposition to the proliferation of
                        nuclear weapons capacity with respect to Israel as well as other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>“Pursuant to this basic intention, the United States Government recently
                        arranged for two highly-qualified American scientists to visit the Israeli
                        reactor site at Dimona. These experts have now furnished us their views.
                        They state that the Dimona project is designed to provide Israel with a
                        research reactor to give scientific and technical personnel experience in
                        the problems posed by a power reactor. In common with many other states, the
                        Israelis are short of power and regard this project as an essential first
                        step toward meeting their industrial requirements. While the reactor will
                        produce small quantities of plutonium, as do others of comparable size and
                        character, our experts found no evidence that the Israelis have weapons
                        production in mind. I am therefore happy to renew to you the personal
                        assurance I furnished to your Ambassador that we believe this reactor is
                        exclusively for peaceful purposes.</p>
                    <p>“During their recent meeting in New York President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> stressed to Premier <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> the continuing concern of the
                        United States regarding proliferation of nuclear weapons capabilities. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> assured the President
                        that the reactor’s only purpose is to develop a cheap source of industrial
                        power and that weapons production was not contemplated. Your Excellency may
                        rest assured that, in accordance with our firm policy in this field, the
                        United States Government will maintain its vigilance.</p>
                    <p>“I understand that the United Arab Republic Government is itself giving
                        active study to the industrial power possibilities of atomic energy. Your
                        representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0219"/>recently approached us in Vienna regarding
                        possible United States assistance in this field. We shall instruct our
                        mission there to seek further details from your representatives.</p>
                    <p>“In view of the sensitive nature of this subject, we are taking particular
                        care in making known the results of the investigation of the Dimona reactor
                        by American experts. Given the immediate concern of the United Arab Republic
                        with the reactor we have wanted to give your Government this information
                        first. I recognize, of course, that you will no doubt wish to apprise
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and other senior
                        officials of your Government regarding the contents of this message. I am
                        pleased that this first occasion for renewing communication between us has
                        given me an opportunity to furnish what I trust will be welcome news.</p>

                    <p>Prime Minister Qasim of Iraq in a press conference June 25 asserted old Iraqi
                        claims to Kuwaiti territory and offered to “liberate” the inhabitants of
                        Kuwait. The statement as read over Baghdad Radio referred to <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0220"/>Kuwait several times as “an indivisible
                        part of Iraq” and asserted, “… it is the Iraqi Republic and no one else
                        which signs agreements for Kuwait.” He further announced the intent to issue
                        a Republican Decree appointing the Shaykh of Kuwait qa’ immaqam (district or
                        sub-provincial governor) under the Iraqi province of Basra. Qasim’s move was
                        obviously in response to the termination on June 19 of an Anglo-Kuwaiti
                            treaty,<note n="1" xml:id="d66fn1">On June 19, the Ruler of Kuwait and

                        occasion was grudging to the point of rudeness. Kuwaitis, although annoyed

                        settled at Umm Qasr (now the site of a proposed Iraqi port development,
                        access to which has been at issue for some time between Iraq and Kuwait).
                        Driven from this location by the Turks, the family established itself at

                        shifted allegiance according to the exigencies of local dynastic wars and
                        pressures by larger powers.</p>
                    <p>In the later years of the 18th century, the family and town were under
                        Persian suzerainty, and Kuwait rivalled Basra as a port for the interior of
                        Mesopotamia up to Damascus. However, in 1829 the then ruler had to
                        acknowledge the suzerainty of Turkey and pay tribute to the Ottoman Porte.
                        In return for a subsidy, the Kuwaiti navy protected the mouth of the Shatt
                        al-Arab in the name of the Porte. In 1869–70, the Kuwaiti Ruler joined
                        energetic Turkish Sultan Midhat Pasha in a military campaign into Arabia
                        that conquered al-Hasa province, which, for a time, was governed from Basra
                        as the Turkish province of Najd. Thereafter, the Shaykh of Kuwait formally
                        accepted the Turkish definition of his position and was accepted by the
                        Porte as de jure ruler of Kuwait.</p>

                    <p>By 1897, the then Shaykh of Kuwait was paying little attention to his nominal
                        superiors in Basra. At this time, Kuwait was being considered as the
                        terminus of the proposed Berlin-Baghdad Railway. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, which had not formally accepted the Ottoman right to speak
                        for Kuwait, therefore interested itself, and the English Resident at
                        Bushire, Col. Meade, was authorized by London to contact the Shaykh of
                        Kuwait directly. The Shaykh was interested not only in asserting his
                        independence vis-à-vis Turkey, but also in British help with the perennial
                        skirmishing going on since 1895 between himself and the Rashidi family, head
                        of the powerful Shammar tribe in Saudi Arabia, and later with their

                    <p>On January 23, 1899, therefore, the Kuwaiti Shaykh agreed not to let or cede
                        any part of his territory to other governments or subjects of governments
                        other than England, and to receive no representatives of foreign powers
                        without British authorization. In return, the Shaykh received an annual
                        subsidy and British and Indian protection as needed against the Wahhabi
                        incursions from Saudi Arabia. This is the treaty just denounced by the Iraqi

                    <p>On July 29, 1913, agreement was reached between the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Turkey, by which the boundaries of Kuwait were defined,

                        representation was to be permitted at Kuwait. The outbreak of World War I
                        prevented ratification of this instrument. Instead, England declared Kuwait
                        to be an independent kingdom under British protection. On December 26, 1915,
                        King <persName corresp="#p_SAA5">Ibn Sa’ud</persName> concluded an agreement

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Previous Iraqi Claims to Kuwait</hi></p>
                    <p>During the First World War and subsequent British Mandate over Iraq, Iraqi
                        relations with Kuwait were not a problem. After Iraq achieved independence
                        in 1932, however, anti-British Iraqi nationalists occasionally agitated an
                        Iraqi claim to the territory of Kuwait based on the old Ottoman
                        jurisdiction. In 1937, Iraq extended its protection to Kuwait in a minor row
                        with Saudi Arabia. In 1938, Iraq’s second ruler, the young King Ghazi,
                        loudly demanded annexation of Kuwait and broadcast <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0222"/>Iraq’s claims on Baghdad radio. In that
                        year, the Iraqi government invited Kuwaiti students to study in Baghdad at
                        the Iraqi government’s expense, a move which drew both Kuwaiti and British
                        objections. Early in 1939, when a legislative council in Kuwait was
                        preparing a new constitution which was being so drafted as to guarantee the
                        continuance of special British treaty rights, anti-British riots broke out
                        in Kuwait objecting to the constitution and demanding, among other things,
                        union with Iraq. The disturbance was short-lived, although serious enough to
                        require application of emergency law in Kuwait. Baghdad press and radio, as
                        well as the nationalist Arab Office in Damascus, backed the Kuwaiti
                        dissidents, and there were rumors of Iraqi complicity in rousing the
                        demonstrations. The furor quieted somewhat following the death of King Ghazi
                        in an automobile accident in April 1939.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter, the Iraqi government tacitly accepted the status quo. For the
                        last several years of the monarchy, the government of Nuri al-Sa’id was at
                        pains to court good relations with the Kuwaiti ruling family, welcomed its
                        members’ frequent visits to relatives and properties in the Basra area, and
                        discussed off-and-on the provision to Kuwait of sweet water from the Shatt
                        al-Arab.</p>
                    <p>However, in 1958, following the uniting of Iraq and Jordan in the short-lived
                        Arab Union, Nuri al-Sa’id again revived the claim. This was not a forceful
                        public assertion, but rather a series of quiet diplomatic démarches in an
                        attempt to persuade the Kuwaiti Ruler and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> of the desirability of Kuwaiti adherence to the new Union.
                        Nuri had in mind popularizing the Union with the Iraqi public through the
                        acquisition of Kuwaiti wealth to offset the budgetary drain of Jordan, and
                        at the same time hoped to create a psychology of momentum toward joining the
                        Baghdad-based rather than the Cairo-Damascus union. Neither the Kuwaitis nor
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> evinced any interest, and the
                        suggestion did not receive a great deal of publicity at the time. It was
                        still being advanced by the Iraqi monarchy up to the time of the July 1958
                        revolution.</p>
                    <p>The Qasim regime is therefore advancing an old Iraqi claim, but one that has
                        not in the past received much support from other Arab states and has had no
                        recognition from the world at large. Aside from Qasim’s extreme sensitivity
                        to any manifestation of continued foreign presence in the Arab area, he is
                        probably motivated by his current irritation with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> over the stalled renegotiation of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> concession.<note n="4" xml:id="d66fn4">Documentation is in Department of State, Central File 887.2553.</note>
                        Qasim probably also sees in this a potentially popular issue at a time when
                        popular enthusiasm for his regime is waning at home.<note n="5" xml:id="d66fn5">A handwritten note on the source text, presumably by

                            Israel’s nuclear potential and Israeli plans to divert Jordan waters

                            he believes that neither can get free rein because of the determination
                            of the other to prevent it. He will thus seek to avoid both total
                            dependence on, and total alienation from, the Bloc as well as the West.
                            Although in practice this strategy leads him to side more often with the
                            Bloc than with the West, he has shown himself ready to respond

                    <p>I have not communicated with you before about the Kuwait crisis because we
                        had been hoping to get some clearer indications of whether an Iraqi military
                        move is likely. Kassem is so nearly mad that military action cannot be

                    <p>As you know, last time that our two Governments were preparing military
                        movements in the area, after the Iraqi revolution in July 1958, Foster

                        discuss all this with you and give you our information. We have an absolute
                        obligation to help the Ruler if Kuwait is attacked and, as this is an area

                    </list>
                    <p>The President received us as a group and queried each Ambassador Designate
                        for his views with respect to the area to which he was accredited. When my
                        turn came, he asked me about the crisis over Kuwait, asking whether it was
                        true that the Saudi Arabian Government was moving troops toward that area.
                        When I responded that this was confirmed, he asked whether or not it was the
                        intention of the Saudi Arabian Government to forestall Iraq by taking over
                        Kuwait. I said no; I believed the object of the Saudi move was to defend
                        Kuwait’s independence against the Iraqi threat.</p>
                    <p>In response to a query as to how serious the threat was, I said that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Sir Humphrey Trevelyan</persName> had
                        advised London that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> should be
                        prepared to move troops in the direction of Kuwait to defend it, indicating
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Sir Humphrey</persName>’s fear that the
                        Iraqi Government might make a quick military move. The President said this
                        tallied with information he had received this morning. He asked whether any
                        other Arab countries were taking a position on Kuwait’s side, as was Saudi
                        Arabia. I said yes, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> had come out
                        flatfooted for Kuwait’s independence. To his question whether there were any
                        Arab countries that might support Iraq in its claims, I said that I could
                        think of none likely to do so. He asked about the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> I said that it had not expressed itself. I was not
                        quite so sure about the position of Iran—possibly Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WET1">Wailes</persName> might have a comment—inasmuch as
                        Iran had claims on Bahrain; and if Persian Gulf shaikhdoms were going to
                        break loose from their traditional association with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, in a sense it became “open season” for
                        larger neighboring <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0230"/>powers to assert
                        such claims that they might have. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WET1">Wailes</persName> made no comment on this point.</p>
                    <p>The President turned to converse with the remaining Ambassadors in turn, then
                        concluded the meeting by commenting on the centralized responsibilities of
                        U.S. Ambassadors abroad, referring to the letter which he had written with
                        regard to their proper role as coordinators of all American activities
                        within their jurisdictions.<note n="1" xml:id="d71fn1">For text of this May
                            29 letter, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                            December 11, 1961, p. 993.</note> He added that all of our countries
                        were very important and he hoped that each of us would make it a point to
                        broaden as far as possible his contacts with the people of the countries to
                        which he was accredited. During his own Presidential campaign, he remarked,
                        very few foreign ambassadors in the United States had sought him out and he
                        had met most of them since the inauguration. In a country such as ours it
                        hardly mattered, but in the countries to which we were going it was
                        necessary to develop contacts on every possible level, including the
                        opposition. At this point, I commented that his thoughts had particular
                        relevance to the situation in Saudi Arabia where the United States has
                        enjoyed through its Military Training Mission unusually close contacts with
                        leaders of the Saudi military. These contacts are of great potential value
                        as the regime in Saudi Arabia must surely change and new leadership is most
                        likely to come from this element. The President asked the status of the
                        Military Training Mission. I said that since Saudi Arabia had given notice
                        of its intention not to renew the Dhahran Airfield Agreement when it expired
                        next April 1, there was a question regarding the continuation of the <gloss target="#t_USMTM1">USMTM</gloss>. Actually, two separate agreements were
                        involved, one for the Airfield and the other for the <gloss target="#t_USMTM1">USMTM</gloss>, but they had always been regarded as
                        in the nature of quid pro quo. Many of us felt that the <gloss target="#t_USMTM1">USMTM</gloss> was a positive political asset and if
                        asked by the Saudi Government to continue it—as I expected we would be—I
                        hoped we would be receptive. The President responded that it was indeed very
                        important to maintain our relationship with the military.<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">He added that our officers so assigned should consider
                            this an important duty. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> He said
                        that criticisms were frequently heard on Capitol Hill of military aid to
                        such countries but it was essential nevertheless to keep these contacts in
                        American hands. He inquired whether the Pentagon felt differently from
                        myself on this matter, and I responded that I thought not, that the Pentagon
                        supported this view as far as I could determine.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Action</hi></p>
                    <p>He then instructed me to convey the following message to Assistant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>: That Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> inform him of the decision which <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0231"/>might be made with respect to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USMTM1">USMTM</gloss> in Saudi Arabia before such
                        decision was final.</p>
                    <p>As we shook hands on my departure, I said that I intended, if he agreed, to
                        convey his personal regards to the King of Saudi Arabia and to the King of
                        the Yemen. He nodded assent and remarked he had recently met one of the
                        Saudi princes in the hospital.</p>

                    <p>There are now indications, still somewhat tenuous but pointing unmistakeably
                        at preparations by Qasim to reinforce his troops near Basra with a tank
                        regiment. Our appreciation is that the Iraqis might be ready from July 1 to
                        send a small force with armour across the Kuwait border which could occupy
                        the territory in a few hours. Once the force was poised in the Basra area,
                        we might have virtually no warning of an attack. We are bringing our own
                        units in the area to a state of readiness.<note n="1" xml:id="d72fn1">At 5
                            p.m. on June 29 in the United Kingdom, British <persName corresp="#p_MLL2">Admiral Lord Mountbatten</persName> asked Admiral

                            ordered 12-hour readiness for all forces involved in the Kuwait plan
                            with forward advance forces to arrive off Kuwait on July 1 and others to
                            head toward Bahrain. (Kennedy Library, National Security Files, Country
                            Series, Kuwait, 6/61–7/61)</note> We are in constant touch with the
                        Ruler and are telling him that if he wishes us to defend him the moment has
                        come to invoke our recent exchange of letters with him and request military
                        assistance to meet Iraqi threat. In this event we would try to keep any
                        action in Kuwait itself as unobtrusive as possible but if there were danger
                        of imminent Iraqi attack we would have no alternative but to put forces
                        openly into Kuwait to defend it. If we did not do this and waited for the
                        Iraqis to move first, we might be too late.</p>

                        <item>If we put forces into Kuwait at the Ruler’s request in these
                            circumstances, I hope that we can count on full political support from
                            the United States Government. It would be absolutely essential. You know
                            full well that we shall not do this unless we have to and that forces
                            will remain no longer than is necessary. The importance of Kuwait to the
                            Western world is such, however, that we cannot take the risk of allowing
                            Qasim to seize it unopposed.</item>

                        <item>Naturally we hope that things will not come to this pass, and it may
                            be that the influence of the Arab Governments and of other friendly
                            countries will restrain Qasim. We are sending an immediate message to
                            the Arab Governments of the area and to those of India, Pakistan and
                            Turkey asking them to use any influence they have to restrain Qasim. As
                            we have no relations with Saudi Arabia, would you please urge King Saud
                            to throw his weight in also in favour of restraint?</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>We are very conscious of the United Nations angle on this and the
                            Security Council will clearly have to be seized of the matter if the
                            Iraqi threat develops further. Kuwait is not yet a member of the United
                            Nations and there might be advantage in action being initiated by
                            another Arab Government. We have been wondering whether Saudi Arabia
                            would be the right one for this role. We may consult the Ruler of Kuwait
                            about this. There may be an awkward problem of timing in this
                            connection, since we would not wish an approach to the Security Council
                            to prevent us from taking the necessary precautionary action in Kuwait.
                            We are consulting our mission in New York on this question, and no doubt
                            they will consult yours.</item>

                        While Qasim is, to say the least, unpredictable, we are hopeful that given
                        time to work political forces among the Arabs will dissuade Qasim from
                        committing himself to an unfortunate course of action with unpredictable
                        consequences. We shall be very happy to keep in close touch with you on
                        this.” (Transmitted in telegram 6138 to London, June 29; ibid., Central

                                68</ref>.</note> supported as cogently as I have ever seen the case
                        for the US seeking a limited accommodation with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>:</p>
                    <p>Nationalism will remain the most dynamic force in the Arab world and
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will remain its foremost
                        leader. His influence is likely to grow rather than decline. Meanwhile, he
                        is seeking to balance off the two great power blocs. However, over the years
                        “the inherent incompatibility between ultimate Soviet ambitions in the
                        Middle East and the aspirations of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the Arab nationalists to preserve and strengthen
                        their independent position will become increasingly manifest.”</p>
                    <p>Here is the case for our attempting to stay in the game with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, not trying to outbid the Soviets,
                        not deluding ourselves with any idea that we can bring him into the Western
                        camp but merely that we must live with him and he must live with us. Ergo,
                        are there not areas where we can cooperate, thus providing him confidence in
                        Western support if he runs afoul eventually of the Soviets?</p>
                    <p>As you have pointed out, one of the key things we have to offer is assistance
                        in economic development. In turn, however, we must let <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> know that we expect a compensatory
                        quid pro quo in a less antagonistic policy on his part. A rapprochement
                        along these lines may take years and involve numerous zigs and zags. Only
                        time, for example, is likely to make the Arabs willing to live with Israel.
                        But the many pitfalls which lie ahead are no excuse for not deciding now
                        whether to move in the direction of a long-term policy of this sort.</p>

                    <p>2138. Following background summary Kuwait situation:</p>
                    <p>Subsequent to announcement June 19 <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Kuwait
                        exchange letters which redefines <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Kuwait
                        relationship and abrogates 1899 Agreement, Iraq Prime Minister dispatched
                        message to Ruler of Kuwait which omitted reference Kuwait independence and
                        raised question legality Kuwait’s existence separate from Iraq. In press
                        conference June 25 Qasim denounced <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Kuwait
                        relationship and asserted Kuwait part of Iraq since Sheikhdom had been
                        illegally separated in Ottoman times from Province of Basra. Iraqi claim
                        embodied in memorandum circulated to foreign governments.</p>
                    <p>Reactions to Qasim’s statements have included expression deep concern from
                        Saudi Arabia where Cabinet has met in emergency session and King dispatched
                        Chief of Staff General al-Tassan to Kuwait for consultation with Kuwait
                        leaders. Statement by King Saud affirmed Kuwait and Saudi Arabia “as one
                        country” and he has sent message to other Arab heads state urging support
                        Kuwait’s independence. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Minister of State
                        reflected <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> concern in statement June 25
                        deploring situation that has arisen and upholding principle of Arab unity.
                        In Baghdad idea of Kuwait’s absorption long popular but politically
                        conscious Iraqis and Qasim’s many detractors probably view his posture as
                        risky and perhaps absurd. At same time danger exists he may be committed to
                        choice between eventual resort to force or heavy loss of prestige.
                        Officially Iraqi Foreign Minister has assured us Iraq has no intention using
                        force. In Kuwait, Ruler enjoying full popular support in his professed
                        determination preserve Kuwait’s independence.</p>
                    <p>In past 24 hours there have been rumors of threatening Iraqi troop movements.
                        While these not confirmed, British now deeply concerned and feel obliged
                        take steps preparatory meeting their obligations to Kuwait. British
                        spokesman has now admitted publicly Britain taking precautionary steps.
                        British vessels and military equipment moving to Persian Gulf area, although
                        British anxious to limit insofar as possible knowledge these movements.</p>
                    <p>US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in close consultation. US continues
                        hope Arab states may play leading role in deterring Iraqis. Both <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Saudi Arabia obviously concerned

                            already been demonstrated in a most gratifying fashion. On the other

                            that “Solant Amity” should continue in the meantime to steam North and

                            hours or so and, in any case, before the force reaches Bahrain. (The
                            fact that this force has altered its plans and is proceeding towards the
                            gulf has already appeared in the press which in itself has probably had
                            a good effect.)</item>

                        <item>It emerged from the discussion this morning that the most useful help
                            which the U.S. Navy could give us at the present moment would be if the
                            U.S. destroyer at Bahrain (the other is believed to be at Aden) could
                            proceed to the north of the gulf and make a reconnaissance to see
                            whether there are any signs of Iraqi maritime activities. The reason for
                            this is that there are twelve motor torpedo boats, some with partly
                            Russian crews, at Basra at the moment and reports of Iraqi troops being
                            sent to Fao which may indicate the intention of the Iraqis to embark on
                            some maritime adventure. Our own naval forces in the area are still
                            rather thin and reconnaissance by the U.S. destroyer could be of great
                            help—particularly if at the same time the second destroyer were to be
                            moved round to Bahrain from Aden. Unless you see objection please
                            mention this matter to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            and suggest that if the U.S. authorities were agreeable, the U.S. naval
                            authorities on the spot should discuss the matter with flag officer
                            Middle East at Bahrain.</item>

                    <p>Between July 2 and 7, 1961, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Security
                        Council met to consider a July 1 Kuwaiti complaint to the Security Council
                        that Iraq was threatening Kuwait’s territorial independence and an Iraqi
                        complaint delivered on July 2 that the United Kingdom posed an armed threat
                        to Iraq’s independence and security. After a discussion of the issues
                        involved, the United Kingdom on July 6 submitted a draft resolution that
                        called upon all states to respect Kuwait’s independence and territorial
                        integrity, urged that all concerned work for peace and tranquility in the
                        area, and agreed to keep the situation under review. The United Arab
                        Republic objected to the United Kingdom’s draft on the basis that it did not
                        provide for the withdrawal of British forces, and consequently submitted its
                        own draft resolution urging that the question be solved by peaceful means
                        and calling for an immediate withdrawal of British forces from Kuwait.</p>
                    <p>On July 7, the Council voted 7 in favor, 1 opposed, with 3 abstentions on the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> draft resolution. Because the
                        negative vote came from the Soviet Union, a permanent member of the Security
                        Council, the draft resolution failed of adoption. The Council then voted on
                        the draft of the United Arab Republic, 3 in favor, 0 against, with 8
                        abstentions. This draft resolution also failed of adoption because it did
                        not obtain the required 7 affirmative votes. The United States voted in
                        favor of the United Kingdom’s draft resolution and abstained on that of the
                        United Arab Republic.</p>
                    <p>During the discussion, the U.S. Representative affirmed that the United

                    <p>The Saudi Ambassador reminded the President that they had met on two previous
                        occasions, at a hospital in New York when Prince Faisal was a patient and
                        then in the Senate after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                        had made a speech favoring negotiations for Algerian independence. The
                        President recalled both occasions and commented he had been particularly
                        grateful for the Saudi King’s message after his Algerian speech as one of
                        the few really cordial responses to what had not been a very popular speech
                        here.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador informed the President that he had just received the reply of
                        His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia to the President’s letter which had
                        been written in May,<note n="1" xml:id="d81fn1">Kennedy’s May 11 letter to
                            Saud is the same as the letter to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> (see <ref target="#d47">Document 47</ref>) except
                            that the fourth paragraph reads: “I recall the very useful and
                            constructive meeting of President Roosevelt with Your Majesty’s

                            penultimate paragraph reads: “With respect to relationships between
                            Saudi Arabia and the United States, I share Your Majesty’s desire that
                            the close ties which have so happily existed between our two great
                            countries should continue to flourish. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HDR2">Heath</persName> has kept us fully informed
                            concerning matters of mutual interest and I am indeed grateful for the
                            many kindnesses which you and your government have accorded him as the
                            representative of the United States government and people.” (Telegram

                            the Arab-Israeli dispute, particularly that taken during the recent

                            considering the Palestine question was that the Arabs were the legal

                            was a usurper and aggressor established with the political assistance of
                            the United States. (Department of State, Central Files,
                            786A.00/6–2591)</note> When the President had read the letter carefully
                        and intently, the Ambassador, speaking in <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0241"/>Arabic which was translated into English by Major Badawi,
                        said that he was sure the President understood that in the Saudi
                        Government’s view there are good relations and not many difficulties between
                        his country and the United States. The problems that do arise are mainly
                        those related to a third state, and the President would know to what he was
                        referring.</p>
                    <p>Commenting on the letter, the President said the United States had hoped
                        that, whatever the history of the situation might be, it would be possible
                        to face the problems that exist today and to make some progress toward
                        solving them. This would, of course, depend upon the willingness and desire
                        of the people and governments of the area. The United States had advanced
                        some suggestions in the hope that they might be helpful. Now this reply had
                        come with some comments that were very critical of the policies of his
                        Government. If there were no agreement to proceed with trying to find
                        solutions, then of course we would not proceed.</p>
                    <p>Referring to other aspects of relations between Saudi Arabia and the United
                        States the President said he understood that the Ambassador had been
                        informed of United States’ readiness to fulfill the conditions of the
                        agreement for sale of United States military equipment to Saudi Arabia. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> confirmed that the
                        Ambassador had met with the Secretary yesterday<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">The memorandum of conversation is ibid., 611.86A/7–661. For text, see
                            Supplement, the compilation on Saudi Arabia.</note> and had been told
                        that the United States would provide this equipment, subject to the force
                        levels agreed upon under the “1380 Plan” and subject also to availabilities.
                        The Ambassador explained that these two conditions were indeed the
                        uncertainties. He was leaving for home next Tuesday and hoped that he could
                        carry a definite reply to his Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> further explained that the Defense Department is now
                        examining the Saudi requests in the light of the “1380 Plan” and of
                        availabilities and he hoped to be able to inform the Ambassador before the
                        latter’s departure of the date by which a firm reply to the Saudi
                        Government’s request could be expected. The Ambassador again suggested that
                        he really hoped for explicit answers to take home with him. The President
                        then instructed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> to inform
                        him by Tuesday of what could be told the Ambassador before his departure.
                        The President added that the Ambassador before he left would have
                        opportunity for specific discussions with the Department on other questions
                        as well, including the Dhahran airfield and the Military Training Mission.
                        In response Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> informed the
                        President, with the Ambassador’s assent, that the subjects had already been
                        discussed with the Ambassador and that we would be glad to answer any of the
                        Ambassador’s further questions.</p>

                    <p>The President asked the Ambassador for his judgment of the Kuwait situation.
                        Giving his personal views, the Ambassador replied that he thought there was
                        not now any likeli<persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> that the Iraqi
                        Government would use force against Kuwait although it would continue to make
                        its claim that Kuwait is part of Iraq. He did not believe that there would
                        be a resort to violence there.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>When the President saw the Saudi Arabian Ambassador on Friday, July 7, the
                        Ambassador asked about availabilities of various items of military equipment
                        included in two recently submitted Saudi Arabian arms purchase requests. The
                        President told the Ambassador that we would try to give him an answer before
                        the Ambassador leaves on July 11.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had earlier told the
                        Ambassador that the United States was prepared to sell to Saudi Arabia, in
                        accordance with the 1957 Dhahran Airfield arrangements, those items on the
                        Saudi Arabian arms purchase lists which were consistent with the jointly
                        developed force goals plan for Saudi Arabia known as the “1380 Plan” and
                        subject to availabilities. Following the President’s discussion with the
                        Ambassador, the Department of State discussed the lists further with
                        appropriate officers of the Department of Defense. A message was
                        subsequently sent to the Chief of the United States Military Training
                        Mission in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, requesting his determination on the
                        compatibility of the items included in the Saudi Arabian lists with the
                        Tables of Organization and Equipment of the “1380 Plan.” Such a
                        determination is necessary in order to allow the Department of Defense to
                        process the lists. A reply is now being awaited.</p>
                    <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0243"/>
                    <p>A preliminary examination of the lists by Departments of State and Defense
                        officials suggests that most of the land forces equipment included thereon
                        is compatible with the “1380 Plan.” The Plan is vague with respect to Air
                        Force equipment, however, and there is some question whether the F–100’s and
                        the B–57’s which the Saudi Arabians wish to purchase may be regarded as
                        compatible. The views of the Chief of the United States Military Training
                        Mission have also been sought on this matter.</p>
                    <p>The Department of Defense was unable to state which items on the lists are in
                        fact available, and indicated that the lists would have to be sent to the
                        respective military services which would in turn determine availabilities.
                        The Department of Defense estimated that it may take from six weeks to six
                        months to determine definitively which items on the very extensive Saudi
                        Arabian arms purchase lists are available and to send the customary Letters
                        of Offer to the Saudi Arabian Embassy. Deliveries will vary with the
                        equipment, but it is estimated they will take a minimum of eight months and
                        in some cases longer.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> carried bulk of conversation for
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> side. Lacking confidence in Arab
                        League or “Arab presence” ability to assure Kuwait independence his thinking
                        centered on an <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>-type presence of
                        forty or fifty observers possibly on both sides Iraq-Kuwait frontier and
                        including an Arab element. As seen by <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> such arrangement would permit <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> maintain its agreement with Ruler, would act as deterrent at
                        low cost with few administrative problems and probably escape Soviet veto if
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> acquiesces. Would not be pursued
                        unless Ruler and US satisfied arrangement adequate. Successful negotiation
                        in New York very unlikely hence negotiation bilaterally with members of
                            <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> required; would be up to US to deal
                        with Saudis. After bilateral negotiation <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                        might apply rubber stamp. <persName corresp="#p_SPP3">Spinelli</persName>-type <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence
                        inadequate in <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>’s opinion.</p>
                    <p>Department officers observed Iraq most unlikely agree to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers on its territory, Soviets and
                        possibly <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> might support Iraqi objection,
                        and if this element included in eventual proposal to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> it would probably be regarded as “gimmick” designed insure
                        defeat <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence plan.</p>
                    <p>Other possibilities canvassed by <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>
                        were replacement of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces by a strong
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> contingent or a political settlement,
                        neither of which seemed practicable to him. According to <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>, London has not yet reacted to his
                        proposals.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> considers Cairo may be key to
                        Kuwait problem. Question is whether <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> can

                    <p>25. I had three hours of conversation with Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> the Foreign Minister yesterday in addition to a social
                        lunch. While I had intended to seek her thinking generally on a number of
                        subjects discussion in fact became confined essentially to sole topic of
                        refugee problem.</p>
                    <p>Referring at the outset to the current tenor of Arab public comment on
                        refugees, excerpts from some of the most vitriolic and unyielding of which
                        she had listed on a piece of paper and handed me, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> took the line that in the circumstances
                        the Israelis did not anticipate that any gesture or initiative they might be
                        prepared to take at this time would elicit any useful Arab response. Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> went on to say that she had
                        hoped that the President’s letters to the Arab leaders and the latters’
                        response might reveal some reason to anticipate Arab cooperation on this
                        problem and that in that event or if we were in a position on the basis of
                        other information to tell the Israelis that we had reason to divine some
                        movement in the Arab position then Israel would be disposed to be helpful.
                        In its absence the Israelis are reluctant at the moment to envisage any step
                        which would only be rebuffed in this matter which is of such vital security
                        concern to Israel.</p>
                    <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0246"/>
                    <p>There followed a long exposition of the steps Israel feels it has already
                        taken in the past to solve the refugee problem notably that she originally
                        permitted some 40,000 Arabs to return to Israel in 1949, that she has
                        subsequently made an offer to accept another large number in the context of
                        a peace settlement and finally that despite the absence of such a settlement
                        and the fact that the Arabs still consider themselves at war the Israelis
                        have released to the refugees a number of blocked financial accounts.
                        Emphasizing Israel’s critical defense position and the security aspects of
                        the admission of any appreciable number of refugees, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> noted that the Arab population here now
                        amounts to some 12 per cent of the total. She also professed to be
                        apprehensive that the return flow of refugees could not effectively be
                        stopped at any given figure and that pressures would arise to increase any
                        number agreed upon. She made a major point of the uncertainties involved in
                        the phrase “free choice” which she said Israel is being urged to offer the
                        refugees. She was unable to accept the theory that any choice could really
                        be free in the absence of a change in the Arab point of view which in her
                        opinion meant in the absence of a peace settlement. She appreciated that the
                        President in his conversation with Ben-Gurion had been fully cognizant of
                        the necessity to safeguard Israel’s security but could not see how that
                        could be accomplished.</p>
                    <p>I argued along line of the Department’s thinking emphasizing the
                        psychological contribution of some initiative at an appropriate time to
                        demonstrate again Israel’s reasonableness on this issue with a view to the
                        coming General Assembly and more generally to improve Israel’s image in this
                        respect world-wide. I similarly confirmed our concern for Israel’s security
                        problem and the fact that we are fully conscious that any steps taken should
                        not prejudice Israel’s justifiable security apprehensions.</p>
                    <p>The essence of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>’s thought and
                        that of her colleagues did not emerge from the matter of argumentation with
                        complete clarity. However, she seemed to me to place major store by the
                        necessity for Israel of having a complete scenario as to where an initiative
                        would lead in the end before Israel would consider embarking on such a
                        course. She was deaf to suggestions that a small step might lead in a
                        desirable direction and could be safe-guarded against damaging Israel’s
                        position in the absence of Arab responsiveness. She reverted as a basic
                        concept to the theory that the correct procedure is still to endeavor to
                        negotiate a peace settlement as a whole after which or as a part of which
                        the refugee problem would solve itself. She repeatedly reiterated Israel’s
                        willingness to sit down at the conference table with Arabs which she felt is
                        sufficiently demonstrative of Israel’s good will.</p>
                    <p>I appreciate that this conversation probably served little to advance us in
                        the desirable direction of this problem and I do not believe that the <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0247"/>attitude expressed can be described
                        as encouraging, perhaps [garble] because it is my understanding that the
                        cabinet had considered the problem at length the day before and the Foreign
                        Minister’s thinking no doubt reflects the government’s current view.
                        However, as indicated previously I think it unrealistic to anticipate any
                        important progress until after the elections and I am consequently not
                        particularly surprised at the views expressed on this occasion.<note n="1" xml:id="d85fn1">Israeli Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> also held a lengthy discussion on the refugee

                            concern that the Arab world viewed the incoming of the new United States
                            administration. Not only have the Arabs considered former President
                            Truman as largely responsible for the partitioning of Palestine and the
                            creation of Israel, but they were disturbed by 1960 campaign statements
                            which they thought suggested that a Democratic administration would seek
                            to coerce the Arab states to make peace with Israel.</item>

                            prevailed in the Near East during the past two or three years should be
                            preserved. Israeli representatives made similar recommendations, based
                            largely on the fact that under conditions of calm Israel has been making
                            tremendous economic strides. For our part, we were preoccupied with the
                            Congo, Cuba and Laos. We thus happily concurred in not stirring up the

                                    to take any initiatives, the Arabs sought at the General
                                    Assembly this spring to inject a highly controversial concept in
                                    a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution concerning the
                                    Arab refugees, i.e. the establishment of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> custodian for Arab properties
                                    left in Israel. Arab representatives obviously wished to make a
                                    test case of their voting strength in the expanded General
                                    Assembly. Had they succeeded a whole series of anti-Israel moves
                                    could be expected. Despite our urgings that new controversial
                                    elements should be deferred to the general review of the refugee
                                    problem scheduled at the General Assembly this fall, the Arabs
                                    pressed for a vote. They did not achieve the required two-thirds
                                        <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> majority. Their defeat
                                    was naturally, and with good reason, attributed to United States

                            the point of being insulting.<note n="8" xml:id="d86fn8">See <ref target="#d81fn3">footnote 3, Document 81</ref>.</note> It was no
                            doubt written largely by his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegate,
                            Ahmed Shuqairi who is a notoriously venomous former Palestinian. The
                            letter reflects the King’s increasing insecurity, which was also
                            evidenced by the precipitousness with which he recently announced the
                            non-renewal of our Dhahran Airfield agreement. The King’s chief rival is
                            Crown Prince Faisal. The latter in great anger stalked out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Assembly when the partition resolution
                            was passed in 1947. He has since that time harbored and frequently
                            manifested deep resentment. The King’s letter no doubt was designed to
                            show himself as patriotic as his fraternal rival. The only redeeming
                            feature in the letter is a brief paragraph in which he agrees that the
                                <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> should have a “final chance” to
                            work on the refugee problem. In the devious Arab mind this green-light
                            to the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> refugee approach could well
                            require as a counterweight seven pages of vitriolic anti-Israel
                            haranguing.</item>

                            be politically unwise in the light of the inter-Arab consultations
                            referred to above. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
                            failure so far to reply may therefore have some slight

                            (in effect the Tri-Partite Declaration of 1950). It should be noted,
                            however, that upon his departure from Idlewild, President <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> disclosed to the press the

                                    concluding that we were hopelessly pro-Israel, has been
                                    arrested. This means that opportunity for our working with the

                    <p>In our view, a major effort with regard to the refugees is still of first

                        renewing our endeavors through the Palestine Conciliation Commission to
                        undertake a reconnaissance mission of the refugee situation in the Near
                        East. The minimal objective is to enable the formulation of constructive
                        recommendations to the General Assembly this fall for inclusion in the
                        important resolution on the refugees. We believe that a large majority of
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members will welcome such a
                        constructive approach. Our Congress will also welcome such initiative by us.
                        If nothing else such an approach may forestall the successful implementation
                        of increasingly extremist moves by the Arabs in their continuing dispute
                        with Israel. Meanwhile because of your letters to the Arab leaders and our
                        sincere support for <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> efforts with regard
                        to the refugees, our own posture will be such as to permit our maximum

                        to our general relationships with the Arab world.</p>

                    <p>In a brief introduction, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>
                        identified the principal elements in the Rationale, including the strategic
                        role of the Near East, the emotional drive toward Arab unity, the problems
                        of orderly economic and social development in a feudal society in
                        transition, etc. He warned that the present calm of the Near East was more
                        apparent than real, since within the next two years Israel will have the
                        capacity to draw Jordan waters, its technical advance will further disturb
                        the Arabs and the refugee problem will call for major review.</p>
                    <p>The more important points raised in the wide ranging discussion that followed
                        were these: <list>

                            <item>Our bargaining power with the Arabs is increasing as world
                                supplies of oil are growing and alternative sources of fuel develop.
                                But this will pose serious problems of readjustment within the Arab
                                states and in our future relations with them.</item>

                                in the Near East differentiates it from Latin America, it cannot be

                                exclusively concerned with government and more designed to identify
                                us with popular demands.</item>

                            <item>The paragraphs concerning the use of force<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">Under the section entitled “Military,” the draft
                                    paper indicated that the United States should “Be prepared to
                                    use force or to support the use of force to ensure the
                                    independence of each state of the area from the Soviet Bloc.”
                                    Under the section entitled “Contingency,” the paper hypothesized
                                    that, in the event of Arab-Israel hostilities, the United States
                                    should take a variety of steps including trade and financial
                                    embargoes; and, “Should these actions be inadequate to end
                                    hostilities promptly, be prepared to take appropriate military
                                    actions. Such measures should be carried out through the United
                                    Nations, if feasible, although unilateral action by the U.S. or
                                    bilateral action with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                                    should, if necessary, be initiated.”</note> were criticized as
                                being unnecessarily general and not responsive to the contingency of
                                disruption of Near East states from within. Some comfort was
                                provided by vivid comments concerning the purely indigenous
                                tradition of clandestinity, secretive plotting and Arab mutual
                                infiltration which had developed a certain immunity to exotic
                                Communist forms of the malady. But the Soviet leap frogging
                                strategy, perhaps, deserved more specific reference.</item>

                            <item>These paragraphs were insufficiently explicit about the
                                unfortunate side effects of using force in the contingencies
                                mentioned.</item>

                            <item>The anomalous position of Israel was commented upon, a country
                                receiving <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> and other forms of
                                assistance even though its per capita income is higher than that of
                                many parts of Europe. Disparities in income within the area as
                                between Israel and Jordan or the oil-producing states and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> were important sources of regional
                                tensions. It was suggested that regional economic organization might
                                help reduce these disparities. Pressure may have to be put on Israel
                                to cause her to act in a responsible way. We should bear in mind
                                that the freedom of action of the USG is not as limited by the
                                supporters of Israel in this country as we sometimes think and we
                                should act accordingly.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>On July 20, 1961, the Arab League Council passed a Saudi-proposed resolution
                        on Kuwait. Its principal points include: (a) Kuwait will ask for the
                        withdrawal of British troops as soon as possible, (b) Iraq should undertake
                        not to use force in connection with Kuwait, (c) any Kuwait desire to unite
                        or federate with Arab League member states should be supported, (d)
                        welcoming Kuwait’s membership in the Arab League and (e) promising Arab
                        states’ support for Kuwait’s application for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership, and (f) stating that the Arab League will take
                        “practical assistance” to safeguard Kuwait’s independence. The Iraqi
                        delegate stalked out of the Arab League meeting when Kuwait was admitted.
                        There is no indication, however, that Iraq will withdraw permanently from
                        the League, although it may keep its participation in suspense for a
                        time.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the “practical assistance” cited above, Secretary General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HMAK1">Hassouna</persName> is reportedly planning
                        to explore this matter and will shortly visit Arab capitals with a view to
                        ascertaining the possibility of obtaining Arab troop contingents to replace
                        the British troops in Kuwait. Thus, the search for an “Arab solution” to the
                        Kuwait problem appears to be progressing satisfactorily. Such a solution
                        should provide the British with a convenient peg on which to hang troop
                        withdrawal. While Kuwaiti membership in the Arab League has not caused Iraq
                        to drop its claim and is not likely to do so, it should prevent any overt
                        action by Iraq.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing developments are in line with the view expressed by the
                        American Consul in Kuwait (Kuwait’s 26)<note n="1" xml:id="d89fn1">Not
                            printed. (Ibid., Central Files, 686D.87/7–1761)</note> that a
                        combination of Kuwaiti membership in the Arab League and in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, coupled with the British readiness and
                        capability to respond with military forces to the Ruler’s request for aid,
                        is probably sufficient protection for Kuwait. This might be supplemented
                        further by a <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> military training mission in
                        Kuwait.</p>
                    <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0258"/>
                    <p>It is also consistent with Jidda’s assessment (Jidda’s 32)<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note> that Saudi Arabia would
                        participate in Arab League efforts to find an “Arab solution” to the problem
                        of assuring Kuwaiti independence and would probably not be adverse to
                        replacing British with troops from Arab League member states. The present
                        Saudi contingent might even be incorporated into an Arab League contingent,
                        and Saudi Arabia would most likely wish to participate in such a mixed force
                        in order to counter <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> participation.</p>
                    <p>Our Embassy in Baghdad, though stressing the need for a face-saving device
                        for Iraq, believes (Baghdad’s 37)<note n="3" xml:id="d89fn3">Not printed.
                            (Ibid., 686D.87/7–1661)</note> that a mixed Arab contingent in Kuwait,
                        once Kuwait has been admitted to the Arab League, should provide a moral
                        deterrent against Iraqi aggression and that Iraq would not attack such Arab
                        forces. This is clearly also consistent with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> thinking, although it is highly doubtful whether the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would wish to provide troops or, for that
                        matter, whether Kuwait would welcome <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        participation. There are reports of Lebanese willingness to provide troops
                        for Kuwait, and the Sudan has also been mentioned as a possibility.</p>
                    <p>All in all, we believe the need for any sort of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in Kuwait is receding, although Kuwaiti membership
                        in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is still an early desideratum. Our
                        Consul in Kuwait opines that a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commission
                        in Kuwait is neither “necessary or workable.” Although <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>’s
                            105)<note n="4" xml:id="d89fn4">Not printed. (Ibid.,
                            786D.00/7–1461)</note> has expressed itself in favor of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> rather than an Arab League umbrella, without
                        producing any strong arguments for this, our posts at Baghdad, Jidda and
                        Cairo show little enthusiasm for a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        presence.</p>
                    <p>The most auspicious feature in the Kuwaiti situation, as it has developed in
                        the last few days, is that it appears to be returning to an Arab context, in
                        which it could probably have been resolved from the beginning. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is already reducing its troops in Kuwait. It
                        would now appear to be feasible and in the British interest to recognize
                        that Kuwaiti admission to the Arab League and the Arab League’s attendant
                        moral commitment to look after Kuwait’s independence, with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Kuwaiti Treaty of June 19 still conveniently
                        situated in the background, offer reasonable assurances that Kuwait’s
                        independence will be protected. In the circumstances, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> would be well advised to attempt to
                        persuade the Ruler, if Arab League action has not already done so, to
                        indicate that the British may now, with his blessing and thanks, withdraw
                        the balance of their forces or at least all but a token company or so.</p>

                            for the Ruler to seek a realistic military force from other Arab states.

                            account of Dr. Farman-Farmayan’s presentation on the economic situation
                            in Iran and a brief description of a discussion among Task Force members
                            of Iran’s political situation that took place following Dr.
                            Farman-Farmayan’s departure from the meeting. A discussion of Iran’s
                            economic situation resulted in the conclusion that the United States
                            would use the $45.5 million figure, or what would be required to
                            complete the Second Plan, in conversations with German officials on
                            economic assistance to Iran. Serious reservations were also expressed
                            regarding the amount of budgetary aid ($36 million) that Iran felt it
                            needed.</note></p>

                        required if the general economic situation does not deteriorate to a point
                        where economic hardship could serve as point of crystallization for a
                        political opposition, probably of the Left, which could pose grave dangers
                        to Free World interests in Iran. The present shape of these economic and
                        financial problems will be the subject for discussion at the Task Force
                        meeting; some details are still open to question as of August 1, and this
                        status report will therefore not go into detail on subjects which will be
                        discussed at the meeting.</p>

                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government continues to
                        maintain itself in power and the Shah continues to support it, although he
                        is unwilling to give up his traditional tight personal control of matters
                        affecting the armed forces. The danger of overt rightist action against the
                        government has receded, but the National Front and other Nationalist
                        opposition groups have intensified their earlier semi-hostile attitude, and
                        the possibility of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s effecting
                        a reconciliation with moderate leaders of the middle class opposition has
                        decreased. The National Front is being sternly but not brutally repressed by
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>, while it continues to
                        attempt to stimulate mass demonstrations. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> and the Shah are firmly resisting neutralist pressures
                        from right and left; communist radio propaganda is actively inciting revolt
                        and condemning <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> as a servant of
                        the Shah and the United States. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>
                        continues his preparations and actions aimed at corruption, bureaucratic
                        inefficiency, and social injustices, but has not been able to capture the
                        imagination of large sectors of the population while at the same time
                        adjusting to the political and legal realities of the situation. The
                        political situation remains critical; we continue to bolster <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> and persuade the Shah to continue his
                        support.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Economic</hi></p>
                    <p>An Iranian delegation is presenting to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> the first draft of the Third Economic Development Plan
                        (scheduled to begin in September, 1962). The Plan is generally
                        well-conceived, although much detail remains to be filled in; it offers
                        favorable possibilities as the base of a Consortium approach to long-term
                        development in Iran. We are giving all possible encouragement and assistance
                        in the development of this Plan, and are preparing to re-orient our direct
                        technical and economic assistance programs to fit in with the Plan.</p>
                    <p>The same delegation has discussed in detail the financing gap in the present
                        Second Plan; this gap has been identified as being in the neighbor<persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName>
                        <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0261"/>of $45 million needed in the form
                        of development loans. We will within a few days be required to make
                        decisions as to the methods by which we can, together with the Federal
                        Republic of Germany, provide the necessary financing. Curtailment of this
                        Plan would throw the Third Plan out of balance, damage the Iranian
                        government politically, and probably result in the cancellation of large
                        Iranian contracts with American concerns.</p>
                    <p>The Iranian government’s budget for the fiscal year, which must, for
                        political reasons, include large sums for teachers’ pay raises, is out of
                        balance. It appears inevitable that the Iranian government will soon request
                        a considerable budget grant from the United States in order to avoid
                        breaching its economic stabilization agreement with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and losing drawing rights under that
                        agreement. We have up to now reserved a sum of $5 million for this type of
                        assistance should it be necessary.</p>
                    <p>Iran’s efforts to fight inflation and scale down its economic commitments
                        have resulted in a growing economic depression which affects both the
                        business community and the urban proletariat. The threat of mass urban
                        unemployment is looming larger; we are working on projects involving surplus
                        agricultural commodities which may to some extent ameliorate the resulting
                        dangerous political tensions.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Military</hi></p>
                    <p>Although we have informed the Shah specifically that he cannot expect
                        increases in our military assistance program, he is again pressing our
                        Ambassador for greater assistance in the form of advanced equipment and
                        weapons, and has asked us to “restudy” his military problems and our
                        military assistance program. The inter-agency Military Planning Review now
                        under way may well reach conclusions which will result in the Shah’s
                        dissatisfaction being intensified, since there seems little justification
                        for an increase in our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to Iran in view
                        of the current political and economic conditions there. We may in future be
                        faced by the Shah with repetitions of his earlier veiled threats to turn to
                        neutralism unless our military aid is greatly increased. Preliminary studies
                        indicate that there is little hope for assuaging the Shah’s military
                        ambitions by giving him assurances or by informing him of detailed plans to
                        come to his assistance in case of attack.</p>

                                efforts to solve Iran’s immediate political and economic problems
                                and to construct a broad political synthesis. This encouragement
                                should be given in such a manner to avoid so far as possible
                                arousing the Shah’s active opposition. The U.S. should be prepared
                                to tolerate certain seemingly anti-American actions by <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> which do not really damage
                                any major American interest.”</p>
                            <p>In our Mission’s contacts with Iranians, official and unofficial, and
                                in the Department’s contacts with Iranian officials in the U.S., no
                                opportunity has been lost to encourage the Prime Minister. Our
                                Ambassador was recently instructed to reiterate our support to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>. At the same time,
                                in our contacts with the Shah and with the Shah’s henchmen, we have
                                made it clear that we assume that the Shah will support the Prime
                                Minister. Thus far, the Shah has done so; at times with bad grace,
                                as when he recently told our Ambassador that he was <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s sole supporter. However, he
                                continues to accord <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> a
                                degree of freedom unmatched by any Prime Minister since Mosadeq and
                                the early months of the <persName corresp="#p_ZA5">Zahedi</persName>
                                regime, although he continues, as was expected, to keep a firm
                                personal hand on matters relating to the security forces and foreign
                                affairs. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has not, up to
                                the present, been forced to take the “seemingly anti-American
                                actions” envisaged in the Task Force recommendation. Our Consulate
                                in Isfahan has recently suggested that it may be necessary for the
                                U.S. to indicate publicly its specific support for the Prime
                                Minister as a chosen instrument. We have asked our Embassy to
                                comment on this suggestion; we feel that such a move is unnecessary
                                and would be dangerous in the long run.</p></item>

                            <p>Reorientation of the U.S. foreign aid program to Iran must of
                                necessity be based on the new and comprehensive Third Development
                                Plan, scheduled to begin in September, 1962. This Plan, in its first
                                draft, is now being presented to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> for study and suggestions. From a preliminary
                                study, the Plan appears to be fairly well drawn, but there are still
                                many areas which require further study and revision. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/Iran is already planning for
                                drastic revisions in its organization and programs to implement the
                                necessary reorientation. It should be noted that the Third Plan is
                                based upon a successful completion of the current Second Plan, which
                                is in financial difficulties. Item (a) of the recommendation has
                                been accomplished. We are holding in reserve the sum earmarked in
                                item (b), but recent data indicate that it may be insufficient to
                                meet the needs of the situation we foresee. It was the
                                implementation of item (c) which enabled us, through action by

                            <p>The Joint Chiefs have examined these suggestions and have prepared a
                                study of them. In general, this study recommends against the
                                possibilities mentioned. State and Defense working level
                                representatives are meeting on this subject next week and will make
                                recommendations to the Chairman of the Task Force. These
                                recommendations will probably be negative in nature. It will be
                                recalled that the Task Force was interested in these ideas primarily
                                as a means of softening the impact <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0264"/>on the Shah of U.S. unwillingness to go along with
                                his ambitious military plans. At present, it does not seem likely
                                that this hope can be realized.</p></item>

                                the Shah to move toward a more constitutional role.”</p>
                            <p>Thus far we have acted on this recommendation by applauding the Shah
                                for his action in giving authority to <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> and keeping himself out of the limelight to
                                the extent that he has done so during the past few months. To go
                                further and more directly toward the core of the problem at this
                                time would probably be counterproductive in that the Shah’s
                                suspicions and hostility toward both the U.S. and <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> would be roused, and he could
                                well take action to drop the Prime Minister, who must have the
                                Shah’s support at this juncture. Additionally, should the Shah relax
                                his political control over the armed forces at this time, it might
                                touch off a rightist military coup against the Prime Minister. So
                                far, the Shah is doing remarkably well in refraining from
                                interference with the Prime Minister; we intend to postpone further
                                action in implementing this recommendation until such time as
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> enjoys greater
                                political support and the present crisis atmosphere is
                            relaxed.</p></item>

                                political parties in Iran.”</p>
                            <p>The Task Force envisaged the establishment of broadly-based political
                                parties as an essential element in the remaking of the presently
                                polarized Iranian society. The establishment of such a group or
                                party appears to be a necessary precondition to relatively free
                                national elections in Iran in which the Prime Minister would have
                                any chance of success against the National Front (which is becoming
                                entirely too broadly based) and against the divided forces of the
                                traditional elite. The Prime Minister has so far been too
                                pre-occupied with immediate political and economic problems to
                                devote much attention to the problems of building a political
                                organization. He did mention to a U.S. official that he realized the
                                need and hoped to begin in the near future. We have asked our
                                Embassy for comments as to the desirability of the formation of a
                                centrist party or Front, and for suggestions as to what the U.S.
                                could appropriately do to stimulate and assist such a
                                development.</p></item>

                                verification and abuse. The Iranian government has therefore taken a

                                of the 1958 Presidential letter to the Shah stressing the
                                operational proficiency of existing forces but deferring
                                consideration of the activation of additional units.”</p>
                            <p>This stance is reflected in our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                                for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 as presented to Congress.
                                In addition, we have informed the Shah that the U.S. is not
                                contemplating any assistance program designed to raise significantly
                                the manpower or equipment levels of the Iranian armed forces. The
                                Shah has indicated that he has lowered his sights from the previous
                                goal of 260,000 men to the present level of roughly 200,000. He has
                                not followed through on an earlier “threat” to carry out a major
                                manpower reduction. He has recently renewed to our Ambassador his
                                earlier appeals for more and better equipment, particularly for his
                                Navy and Air Force and has asked that the U.S. restudy his needs.
                                Our own Military Planning Review Committee is now at work on just
                                such a restudy—it is unlikely that the results of the study will be
                                to the Shah’s liking. The Shah has carefully protected the military
                                portion of the Iranian budget in the recent Iranian budgetary
                                review, despite the Prime Minister’s well-known predisposition to
                                reduce military expenditures. There is no doubt that the Shah’s
                                military ambitions are still very important to him, perhaps enough
                                to prompt him to make veiled threats at some time in the future to
                                change Iran’s foreign policy alignment unless his desires are met.
                                It is our present disposition to stand firm should he make such
                                threats.</p></item>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Armin</hi>: At our <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> Ambassadors’ sessions we have spent a good deal of time
                        yesterday and today on the Palestine refugee question. As you can imagine,
                        several of the participants have fairly strong views of the desirability and
                        practicality of different courses of action. <persName>Jack
                            Jernegan</persName>, for example, feels so skeptical that any concrete
                        result can be achieved from an approach on the refugee question this year
                        and so sure of unfortunate efforts of an unsuccessful effort that he would
                        only very reluctantly support any initiative whatsoever. Several of the
                        others, while recognizing the over-all advantages of some initiative, fear
                            <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0267"/>that a U.S. effort will have
                        smaller prospect of success and be potentially more damaging to our
                        interests than an effort under <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> or other
                        auspices. Nevertheless, the consensus was that we should make a specific
                        effort in the very near future to achieve some advance on the <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> and other refugee issues.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SRC4">Bob Strong</persName> and I explained to the
                        group the efforts that you and others have made to date and told of
                        Ambassador Lindt’s bowing out after protracted consideration of the
                        invitation to become <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> Special
                        Representative. We also explained Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName>’s evident reluctance to involve <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> prestige in refugee matters at this time.
                        Against these factors I pointed out the October 15th deadline for a <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> report, and necessity of a debate on <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> at the 16th General Assembly, and
                        current Congressional interest in this whole topic.</p>
                    <p>After lengthy discussion yesterday afternoon had produced the consensus that
                        the U.S. should take some action despite the unfavorable prognosis, I asked
                        a sub-committee consisting of Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> to draft a proposal
                        for discussion by our full group and reference to the Department. That
                        proposal, presented this afternoon, is attached hereto,<note n="1" xml:id="d91fn1">Not attached to the source text, nor found elsewhere in
                            Department of State files.</note> along with supplementary explanatory
                        comments by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> You will be
                        interested to know that in the discussion of the draft several points
                        emerged which will be pertinent to our further consideration of the refugee
                        question. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> believes
                        that Israel would prefer no refugee plan this year but expects that the U.S.
                        will offer one and is now prepared to consider this issue apart from other
                        Arab-Israeli questions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> believes that Jordan would be very disappointed if
                        no refugee plan is offered this year but that this proposal (like any other
                        plan he can think of) will not be liked in Jordan because it concedes the
                        permanent existence of Israel and King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> could accept this or any plan, Bill believes, only
                        if it had previously been endorsed by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> is uncertain whether <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> really wants a refugee settlement; he thinks the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> President’s reactions may depend on
                        his mood and feelings at the moment the question arises. Even so, he feels
                        that a proper approach to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is
                        the obvious starting point.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, it is the unanimous view of the group that nothing less than a
                        face-to-face meeting of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> could adequately test <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s willingness to negotiate a process of repatriation,
                        compensation and resettlement which the Israelis could also accept. As you
                        will see from the attached proposal, this is the heart of the Ambassadors’
                        thinking. If Presidents <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, perhaps <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0268"/>meeting at the time of the opening of the
                        General Assembly, could agree to proceed on some such plan as that here
                        suggested, the Ambassadors feel that <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben
                            Gurion</persName> might be persuaded to act with some flexibility as
                        well, confirming the undertaking he gave President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> during their meeting in New York.
                        The rest would flow therefrom.</p>
                    <p>You will recognize in the proposal several elements that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> has suggested more than once.
                        As a rough calculation he put forward <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Davis</persName>’
                        view that resettlement could be achieved for a gross outlay averaging five
                        thousand dollars per family. This would presumably mean a billion dollars
                        for the total effort, a sum which he says he has mentioned to several
                        visiting Senators (including <persName corresp="#p_GAE2">Gore</persName> and
                        McGee) and Representatives without their blanching. Personally, judging from
                        the resettlement costs of refugees in India and Pakistan and from the
                        recollection of one of the Ambassadors that Israel has calculated
                        resettlement costs of 2500 dollars per family, I would suspect the five
                        thousand dollar estimate to be unrealistically high. There is, however, no
                        denying that money—<persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> calls
                        it baksheesh—would be the essential sweetener.</p>
                    <p>A good many other points came up in the discussion. You will see them noted
                        in the summary being prepared by <persName corresp="#p_SRC4">Bob
                            Strong</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d91fn3"><ref target="#d92">Document 92</ref>.</note> Here it is enough for me to repeat that
                        even though all of the Ambassadors are rather doubtful that the proposed
                        effort will in fact set in motion a solution of the refugee question, all of
                        them (<persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> reluctantly) believe
                        it is better to make this effort than to face the General Assembly without a
                        record of having tried. You should also note their feeling that the initial
                        approaches have no prospect of success if undertaken below the Presidential
                        level. Quite apart from other reasons, the time factor rules out any
                        contacts by a special representative of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> with Arab leaders between now and the opening of the
                        General Assembly, they believe.</p>
                    <p>This proposal and these comments will at least give you and <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Harlan</persName> food for some thought. When Bob
                        Strong’s notes arrive you will have some of the more particular suggestions.
                        Beyond that, everyone here agrees the plan would have to be considerably
                        fleshed out before being tried. Here on the island of Cyprus, where
                        Ambassadors away from their posts can let their minds roam, few things seem
                        impossible, and it is in this spirit that we submit this to you.</p>
                    <p>With best wishes,</p>
                    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

                            and hoped that this factor would be taken into account in the analysis
                            of their drafting.</p>

                    <p>Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> presented their paper (transmitted to AHM by PT’s
                        letter of August 3).<note n="1" xml:id="d92fn1"><ref target="#d91">Document
                                91</ref>.</note> They remarked that personal diplomacy by the
                        President is the only hope for making progress on the refugee problem, their
                        proposal makes it possible to bypass the unfavorable attitude of <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss> and takes into account the unfavorable
                        situation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, U.S. initiative is
                        essential particularly since the U.S. puts up the bulk of the money, and it
                        is not possible to spell things out in greater detail in advance.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> referred to a proposal that if
                        Israel were to allow a certain number of Arab refugee families per month to
                        settle in Israel, many would become disillusioned and would leave. (No
                        response from group.)</p>
                    <p>Wilkins proposed that the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> do the Ghab
                        project in Syria and resettle 200,000 refugees there. <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> proposed putting more money into
                        Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> responded that
                        given the emotional nature of the refugee problem King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> was unlikely to buck <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. He referred to the Alpha
                            project<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2">Reference is to U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> discussions held during 1955 to devise
                            a solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute. Project Alpha culminated in the
                            secret mission of <persName>Robert Anderson</persName> to Egypt and
                            Israel. For documentation, see <ref target="frus1955-57v14"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955–1957, volumes
                                XIV</ref> and <ref target="frus1955-57v15">XV</ref>.</note> which
                        sought to settle the whole Palestine problem but ran into the opposition of
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0270"/>
                    <p>Discussion ensued on the cost per family of resettlement, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> suggesting $5–7,000 and Wilkins
                        remarking that the Israeli cost per family for resettlement was $2500.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> remarked that he did not
                        like the term “one-shot” since creation of a whole new social fabric is
                        required. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> agreed with
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> that “baksheesh” was the
                        wrong term since what is involved is compensation, not a gratuity.</p>
                    <p>Wilkins queried what situation we would be in if the project failed or what
                        would be our situation if it succeeded. He suggested that if we succeeded we
                        might be more unpopular with the Arabs but not seriously so. If we fail we
                        may still have put enough pressure on them to vote for some other solution,
                        but in any event we would not be worse off than now.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> pointed out that repatriation
                        must be phased, that Israel cannot accept a flood of refugees. We should not
                        start with a fixed number but let it evolve. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> concurred, pointing out that the President told
                        Ben-Gurion that the repatriation would be phased.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> predicted that the scheme
                        won’t get off the ground, nor any other. Any approach will result in blasts
                        from Iraq or Saudi Arabia and all the rest of the Arabs will have to fall in
                        line. <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> inquired whether the
                        plan could be proposed by other auspices and thus be better received.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> said that this at least
                        would save the U.S. from taking all the beating.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> asked whether there was less
                        risk in trying something under any auspices or in doing nothing. <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> remarked that he would let the
                        whole thing alone, referring to <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName>’s attitude. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> declared that the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> would not touch the refugee problem because it is too
                        political. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> said our name
                        is mud anyhow and we won’t be hurt much if we fail. Wilkins agreed.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> asked how this fits in with the
                        Arab proposal for a property custodian. <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> said it works both ways, Jewish property was
                        confiscated outright in both Egypt and Iraq.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> commented that Israel is more
                        likely now than in the past to accept a reasonable solution on the refugee
                        problem without demanding an overall settlement. What Israel seeks now is an
                        advance agreement on safeguards.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> said Jordan will be deeply
                        disappointed if there is no U.S. initiative but the proposal in front of the
                        group would weaken the regime and set us back because of the irrational view
                        that Israel cannot continue to exist, that the existence of Israel is an
                        historical aberration. There could be a very private approach to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> which would be acceptable to him if
                        he thought he could get away with it.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> stated that the Arabs were
                        humiliated by their defeat by Israel and any solution must be tilted their
                        way so it appears that they have the <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0271"/>preponderance of gain. In the proposed plan he does not see a victory for
                        the Arabs. We can’t buy our way out but must restore Arab dignity.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> replied that Ben-Gurion would
                        be unlikely to survive politically if he makes a public statement on
                        repatriation even if he has an under-the-table arrangement with us.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName> suggested that Tito has good
                        relations with both sides and might take on the job. <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> remarked that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> probably wants the refugee problem
                        solved but much depends on the day and the mood in which he finds himself.
                        He inquired whether stability in the refugee camps would be affected if the
                        approach failed. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> said there
                        was relief in the camps when it was learned that the “Kennedy 25% plan” was
                        found not be be true. The plan as written up might give the refugees a tool
                        to try to topple the King.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> wondered what effect failure
                        would have on Congress; might result in reduced support to <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> was of the view that failure would have no bad
                        effect on Congress; at least we would be seen to be trying. <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> concurred.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> urged that we avoid any
                        appearance that the plan had been hatched with Israel. Any public statement
                        by Israel would lead the Arabs to think it to be a plot. We should appear to
                        buffet Israel into something that appears to give the Arabs a victory.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> noted that the refugees
                        already understand the unpleasantness of living in Israel under Jewish
                        rule.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> summarized as follows: Israel
                        expects an effort but prefers none. Jordan would be disappointed if there
                        were no effort but is unlikely to accept. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may want some sort of settlement but he and <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> say “put the Israel issue on ice”. No
                        other country thinks the refugee problem a threat to world peace but we
                        consider it a serious nuisance. We are under pressure to do something.
                        Congress insists that <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> be cleaned up
                        or that we get out of it. A <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> report is
                        due October 15 and a debate is due in the next <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. The issue will continue to plague us. If we could get a
                        process started tensions would be reduced. It would cost us a lot of money
                        over the next several years. Psychology of expecting something to be done is
                        now greater than ever before. The new administration is expected to do
                        something and if it doesn’t now it probably won’t be done. If we fail no
                        great damage will be done and we shall be better off with Congress. If it is
                        kept secret an approach to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        won’t hurt him. The Arabs have been hammering for exactly what is being
                        proposed. 1962 is an election year and it will be hard to do anything then.
                        We might try to bring the President and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> together this fall. There is unanimity that we should
                        have a try, though <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> is very
                        reluctant. Refugees are not a time bomb but Jordan waters and nuclear energy
                        are.</p>
                    <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0272"/>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName> remarked that we must save Arab
                        face. He thinks there will be shooting when water is diverted by Israel.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> said it could quickly
                        be found whether there is any “give” in <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s position on refugees and if so we could then go to
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. Polk remarked that it
                        would leak in Washington, and he inquired whether there was any other
                        possible type of move that had not been discussed.</p>
                    <p>Wilkins asked whether we can get a commitment from Congressional leaders for
                        money prior to approaching <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and
                        Ben-Gurion.</p>
                    <p>On Jordan waters, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> said
                        Israel would be wise to agree to a watermaster now in order to relieve
                        tensions.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>’s final remark was that there
                        is no Israeli willingness to reduce immigration. This year Israel will have
                        an excess of 100,000 immigrants over emigrants. We cannot influence the
                        rate, so the longer the refugee question is unsettled the less room there
                        will be in Israel for Arabs.</p>

                            Series, Iran, 8/1/61–8/14/61. Secret. An attached note from <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>, dated August 4, reads: “As I described at morning
                            session you missed, last Iran <gloss target="#t_TF1">TF</gloss> meeting
                            (called to ratify more emergency financial aid) was extremely gloomy.
                            State’s main idea of coping with Iran crisis is to subsidize budget and
                            planning development deficits. I have argued vigorously that this is not
                            enough. State (and <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> in
                            Tehran) do not seem to be moving on political side as effectively as
                            deteriorating situation would require. My concern is such that I have
                            chosen attached device to get some movement. I would hope President
                            would express his concern and ask SecState to get moving.” Copies of the

                    <p>Despite its much lower visibility, the continued slide toward chaos in Iran
                        could result in as great a setback as in South Vietnam.</p>
                    <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0273"/>
                    <p>When the Iran Task Force reported to you on May 19, it regarded the
                        newly-formed <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government as the
                        best, and perhaps the last, chance of averting political chaos and the
                        possible loss of Iran to the West. You approved a program of “vigorous
                        action” by the US to seize the opportunity created by the advent of
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>, which appeared to provide
                        several further months of grace.</p>
                    <p>We have now used up three of these months, and the Washington consensus is
                        that the situation has gotten worse instead of better. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has been trying to carry out a
                        vigorous reform program; as always, however, it is a lot harder to execute
                        than to announce reforms, especially in a gimcrack country like Iran.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> is saddled with a weak
                        cabinet, a fact he recognizes but is as yet unable or unwilling to alter.
                        Moreover, he has not been able to develop any middle-class political backing
                        of his own. Contrary to most fears, the Shah has to date been surprisingly
                        strong in backing <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>, but he
                        complained the other day that he seemed to be <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s only supporter. Meanwhile the National Front, a
                        disparate congeries of middle and left politicians, who seem able to unite
                        only on their opposition to <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> (he
                        stole most of their reform program), are seeking to topple him through
                        demonstrations and calls for free elections. Such a slowdown in <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s momentum is largely inevitable (in
                        one sense he’s already accomplished more than all his predecessors since
                        1953), but it is cause for real concern.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">What has the US done?</hi> By some fast financial footwork
                        approved by you, we bailed <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> out
                        of an immediate cash crisis. But now he faces another budget crisis plus a
                        deficit in the final year of the Second Iranian Development Plan. We are
                        trying to get the Germans, who are interested, to help cover these remaining
                        gaps (then we will both help finance the Third Seven Year Plan, which at
                        first reading looks pretty good).</p>
                    <p>But these immediate financial bail-out measures only buy us time at best. The
                        modernization of Iranian society will be a long-term process. Even <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s promising reform program will
                        require four or five years in office to carry out. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> still looks better than any other
                        moderate leader in sight—and far better than either the right wing military
                        dictatorship or chaotic National Front takeover which are the most likely
                        alternatives if he fails.</p>
                    <p>Thus the gut problem is still political—how to keep in power a regime which
                        still seems by far the best bet for achieving a “controlled revolution” in
                        Iran. To do so, we must develop an effective political corollary to our
                        economic support. Here we have moved less vigorously than the situation
                        seems to demand. Our reasons for caution are understandable. To press
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> and the Shah too hard may
                        label them as US puppets; worse still, it may lead them to bite back.</p>
                    <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0274"/>
                    <p>But desperate times call for desperate measures. If we are treading the thin
                        edge of potential disaster in Iran (for which <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> sits patiently waiting), we must treat this as a
                        crisis situation, and take crisis measures, as in South Vietnam. At a time
                        when we face crises in Berlin and Southeast Asia, can this Administration
                        afford not to take every step to avert a setback in Iran?</p>

                        much of its initial momentum and has had little success as yet in developing

                        Moreover, we apparently face additional financial commitments to meet Iran’s
                        recurrent budget difficulties and to make up shortfalls in the second Seven
                        Year Development Plan. He is anxious that we continue to do everything
                        possible to capitalize on the opportunity created by <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s advent, following up the excellent
                        Iran Task Force program which he approved. If the situation seems to be
                        deteriorating rather than improving, are there any further steps which the
                        US could profitably undertake?</p>
                    <p>As a result he is most interested in the Department of State’s current
                        thinking. Should we now regard Iran as a full-fledged crisis situation, and
                        give it sustained Task Force treatment, as we are South Vietnam? Are we
                        doing everything necessary to keep Iran afloat financially and to <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0276"/>get a promising development program
                        going? Can we, for example, get the Shah and <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> to glamorize the new Third Plan as a bold new effort
                        to modernize Iran, around which all elements of Iranian society should
                        rally? What other means can we suggest to <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> to help generate a political base? How can we
                        influence him to get a more competent cabinet? Is there anything more we can
                        get the Shah to do to help <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>,
                        such as allowing a token cut in the military budget? As to the opposition,
                        is there any way we can help <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> to
                        split the National Front and attach to himself its more moderate elements?
                        Finally, if we are nonetheless dubious as to <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s prospects, should we step up quiet contingency
                        planning against his fall?</p>
                    <p>The President believes that it would be helpful if the Iran Task Force could
                        prepare by the end of this week a follow-on report assessing what further
                        measures, if any, seem desirable to forestall another Iranian crisis, and be
                        ready to meet with him, if necessary, to consider these steps.</p>

                    <p rend="center">II. Basic Assumption</p>
                    <p>2. There will be no arms control or nuclear weapons control measure
                        established between the present time and the time when Israel could acquire
                        a nuclear capability.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III. Technical Considerations Bearing on This Problem</p>
                    <p>3. Recent information confirms that Israel is engaged in construction of a 26
                        MW heavy water reactor and supporting facilities in the Negev at Dimona.
                        Israeli officials state that the Dimona installation is to be a national
                        laboratory for atomic research with the primary mission of achieving
                        experience for the future construction of nuclear power stations. [<hi rend="italic">4–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] The
                        Dimona site will provide the Israelis with the necessary experience to
                        develop plutonium production capability beginning with the processing of ore
                        and proceeding through the separation of plutonium.</p>
                    <p>4. Extensive evidence exists that France has supplied plans, materials,
                        equipment, and technical assistance to the Israelis, and is also training
                        Israeli personnel. It is suspected that France will furnish ore probably
                        under safeguards, in addition to the 85 tons which were reported to have
                        been shipped from France to Israel. Israel has no large scale native source
                        of uranium ore, and they have attempted to purchase ore from sources not
                        requiring safeguard provisions. It is reported that an attempt is being made
                        to purchase ore from Argentina. The Israelis have obtained assistance from
                        Norway, including 20 tons of heavy water.</p>
                    <p>5. [<hi rend="italic">7–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>6. The United Arab Republic (<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>) has a
                        nuclear research program in operation, based on Soviet <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> agreements concluded in 1956. The urge
                        behind the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> program of atomic research
                        appears to spring from a desire for prestige within the Arab world. The two
                        megawatt Soviet-supplied research reactor now being completed poses no
                        military threat. Since the disclosure of the Israeli reactor site at
                            Dimona,<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> press statements have implied
                        that future <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> development might be of a
                        military nature. However, it does not at this time seem probable that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will be in a position to build or to
                        operate a large reactor either for power or for weapons production, without
                        substantial assistance from foreign experts.</p>

                            question of boundaries, Arab refugees, freedom of navigation in the Gulf
                            of Aqaba, Jordan River water problem, and the use of the Suez Canal. In
                            1948 and again in 1956 these disputes resulted in armed conflict with
                            Israel showing a military superiority over her Arab neighbors. The

                            assistance in achieving nuclear capability, and produce demands from the

                        Near Eastern and selected European posts that Johnson had agreed to accept

                        situation, and enclosing a lengthy study prepared in the Department of
                        possible courses of action designed to further our objectives.<note n="3" xml:id="d97fn3">Entitled “<gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> Study of
                            Possible U.S. Action Re the Long-Term Political Situation in Iran,”
                            August 10. (Ibid.) See Supplement, the compilation on Iran.</note> A

                    <p>It was the general sense of the Task Force that the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> regime has not, as might have been
                        hoped, succeeded in capturing the imagination of the general public and
                        progressing toward the development of a new political synthesis. In this
                        respect, therefore, it has lost momentum. However, as set forth in the
                        letter, there appears to be no immediate threat to the regime. Measures
                        designed to maintain economic stability and progress for the immediate
                        future are well under way. Long-range comprehensive economic and social
                        development programs in line with new United States foreign aid concepts are
                        also going forward.</p>
                    <p>The most serious problem the Task Force sees is long-term in the sense that,
                        unless <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> finds the way to acquire
                        broad political support, one or another of Iran’s burgeoning problems will
                        sooner or later unseat him. Possible courses of action on the part of the
                        United States to assist him to do so are limited and in a very sensitive
                        area of internal politics.</p>
                    <p>The Task Force examined at length a series of proposals contained in the
                        aforementioned Departmental study. It was agreed that these proposals be
                        forwarded to our Ambassador in Tehran for comment. Assist-ant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>, the Chairman of the Task
                        Force, fortuitously will be in Tehran from August 20 to August 28. This will
                        provide an opportunity to obtain the considered views of both the Ambassador
                        and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> regarding the current
                        situation and what further might be done.</p>
                    <p>The Departmental study of possible United States actions which we are sending
                        to Tehran covers a broad spectrum. There is attached a partial list of the
                        principal areas which should be further explored.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing, this memorandum should be considered as only an
                        interim reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>’s August 7
                        memorandum to the Secretary on this subject.</p>
                    <p>The Task Force is of course prepared to meet with the President at any time
                        to discuss its work. It would suggest, however, that consideration of this
                        possibility be deferred until after the Ambassador’s response and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>’s personal observations
                        have become available.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Julius</persName></hi>: Iran continues to be the subject of
                            attention and some anxiety at the highest levels both here in the
                            Department and in the White House. Accordingly, the Iran Task Force has
                            been asked to go over and to approve this letter. I am very pleased that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>, the Chairman of the
                            Task Force, will be with you in Iran shortly, and the Task Force hopes
                            that, through full discussions with you, he will be able to bring back
                            with him a more detailed picture of your thinking than we could hope to
                            obtain through correspondence.</p>
                        <p>We were gratified by the general excellence of the Third Plan frame as
                            presented to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> by Mr.
                            Farman-Farmayan. The reaction of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> is tentatively favorable, and we have every reason to
                            hope that the Third Plan will become the base of a long-range
                            Consortium-type lending approach which will reflect in classic form the
                            basic foreign aid policies of the Administration.</p>
                        <p>As you have noted, the news from Bonn appears to be surprisingly
                            favorable in connection with the Federal Republic’s contribution to the
                            financing of the Second Plan gap, and we believe that we will be able to
                            come through, if it should prove necessary, with development lending to
                            make up some relatively small portion of the gap which the Germans may
                            not be able to cover.</p>
                        <p>Although our view of the Iranian budgetary problem for 1340 is by no
                            means frozen, we do believe that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            has overestimated its deficit by a very large margin. No doubt careful
                            probing of some of the large expenditure increases, such as the increase
                            for the Cereals Department, would reveal areas where cuts could be made
                            without serious economic damage. We are inclined to believe, however,
                            that estimated expenditure levels are generally reasonable and should be
                            accepted at face value.</p>
                        <p>On the revenue side, however, we are persuaded that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>’s estimate of customs revenues falls
                            about a billion rials short of what can be reasonably expected. Starting
                            from this point, we visualize a potential budget deficit of $23 million
                            (1.7 billion rials). Assuming (as now appears likely) that the Germans
                            provide a loan of $10 million for <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss>
                            projects and assuming that about $7 or $8 million of such a loan could
                            be <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0285"/>used during this Iranian
                            year, the deficit could be reduced to about $15 million. As you know,
                            $13 million of the estimated deficit is to be used to retire public debt
                            so that credit expansion in the private sector can rise beyond the
                            Stabilization Program ceiling of $39 million (3 billion rials).</p>
                        <p>In view of your recent report (despatch #60, July 26)<note n="6" xml:id="d97fn6">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                888.14/7–2661)</note> that the public debt was reduced by $45
                            million in the first quarter of the current Iranian year, it strikes us
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is unduly concerned about
                            its ability to meet this goal. Should we assume, however, that further
                            experience and later information shows that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>’s concern is justified, we are informed that the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> would be prepared to consider a
                            revision of the Stabilization Program to permit private credit expansion
                            of $52 million (4 billion rials) without an off-setting reduction in the
                            public debt. In sum, it would appear from the foregoing that Iran should
                            be able to carry out its 1340 budget as now constituted without U.S.
                            budgetary assistance in addition to the $15 million already given. We
                            recognize, however, a strong possibility of future emergency
                            requirements for our earmarked $5 million or even more.</p>
                        <p>We would appreciate your comments on the above analysis, along with any
                            further data which may be developed and which would affect our
                            conclusions. Be assured that we and the Iran Task Force feel strongly
                            that we should stand ready, within our resources, to assist Iran in its
                            budgetary problems to the extent that there is real need for such
                            assistance. In view of the above, however, I am sure that you agree that
                            we are acting in the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>’s interest, as
                            well as our own, by waiting to get a clearer view of the problem.</p>
                        <p>At present, we in Washington are more concerned over political factors in
                            the Iranian situation than over current and future economic problems.
                            Many problems may arise in the economic sector but, granted a
                            continuation of the economic competence which the Prime Minister and his
                            advisors have shown and granted the approval of the Administration’s
                            foreign-assistance legislation now before the Congress, we believe that
                            the Prime Minister will probably be able to avoid economic catastrophes
                            and that Iran will be able to enjoy that minimum of economic stability
                            and development which will enable the Prime Minister to devote himself
                            to the political and psychological problems which confront him.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it appears to us that the Iranian Government faces no
                            immediate and crucial political crisis involving possible revolution.
                            Rightist anxieties have been quieted, the Shah appears to be continuing
                            his support of the Cabinet, and the National Front and its allies are
                            being quietly but effectively repressed without unnecessary brutality
                            and <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0286"/>without bloodshed. There
                            are no indications that the security forces will waver in their loyalty
                            to the regime in the near future, although the long-term elements of
                            dissatisfaction are undoubtedly still at work.</p>
                        <p>Our primary concern at this time, and the primary purpose of this letter,
                            revolves around the longer-term political outlook. As you recall from
                            your work with the Task Force a few months ago, we have been acutely
                            aware of a growing gap between the burgeoning and largely neo-Mosadeqist
                            elements of the urban middle class and the more traditional and
                            conservative elements of society. We felt, and we still feel, that
                            amelioration of this disunifying trend through the creation of a
                            moderate “bridge” embodying a new and Centrist political synthesis is
                            the most promising (and perhaps the only) alternative to increasing
                            disunity and eventual political collapse. We decided that the Shah,
                            despite his many admirable qualities, had not and probably would not
                            display the political creativity and flexibility needed to overcome this
                            trend. We pinned our hopes on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Our reading of the political situation in Iran is most disquieting in the
                            light of the points mentioned above. It appears that the Prime Minister
                            has lost a great deal of his early grip on the imagination of the public
                            by failing to carry out expected changes, and that while he has reduced
                            the threat of attack from the Right and from the Shah himself, he is
                            drawing away from, and not toward, the moderate leaders of the urban
                            middle-class, and is, in effect, assuming a posture similar to that of
                            earlier Prime Ministers who have despaired of coming to terms with the
                            urban opposition. He is, of course, technically far more competent than
                            his predecessors. But we suspect that honesty and technical competence
                            alone are not going to result in a solution of Iran’s long-term
                            psychological problem in less than a decade, and we feel most strongly
                            that as long as the half-Westernized and strategically placed forces in
                            Iranian politics are implacably hostile to the Government, <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> and the Shah will not have many
                            years before the slow dry rot, which has been spreading for the past six
                            years, will penetrate the security forces to such an extent that the
                            daily survival of the regime will become a matter of conjecture. This
                            process would almost certainly involve an increase in direct Tudeh
                            influence on (if not control of) the organized opposition and would
                            increase potentialities for the Tudeh to operate and expand in the
                            atmosphere of a successor regime.</p>
                        <p>To judge from his most recent statements, <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has apparently begun to despair of making any
                            immediate progress in winning over the urban middle-class opposition and
                            is instead planning to repress them as gently as possible while ruling
                            through the bureaucracy, with the Shah and the Army in support, in such
                            a fashion as to demonstrate to the heirs of Mosadeq that his way is
                            better than theirs. It may well be that <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0287"/>this decision is the only one open to him; we are not
                            prepared to state categorically that he is taking the wrong tack.</p>
                        <p>What can <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> do and what can we
                            do—in the way of help or pressure—to escape from this blind alley—if,
                            indeed, the long-term political problem admits of any other approach
                            than to play for time and hope for the best? The attached study examines
                            a number of very tentative suggestions of possible courses of action. I
                            admit that none of them appear to hold much promise of a brilliant
                            solution to <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s dilemma. I
                            also realize that <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> himself,
                            aiming for the same long-range goals which we envisage for Iran and
                            being personally a political realist, may be presumed to be far more
                            capable than we of judging their applicability and promise. We realize
                            further that <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s freedom of
                            action is severely limited by economic realities and by the necessity of
                            staying in office from day to day and of retaining at least a minimum of
                            tolerance and support by the Shah and the security forces.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, we are still concerned over the continuing gloomy
                            long-range prospects of the regime, and are eager to receive the
                            Embassy’s assessment of what we can do to cope with this most
                            disquieting trend.</p>

                        report on what further actions feasible, has already had a healthy cathartic
                        effect. The State people, in the papers they prepared for the <gloss target="#t_TF1">TF</gloss> meeting and in the meeting itself,<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2">See <ref target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note> came up
                        with more interesting ideas and sense of movement than they have surfaced in
                        the three months since the initial <gloss target="#t_TF1">TF</gloss>
                        report.</p>
                    <p>However, we still have an uphill battle against what I would call a sense of
                        fatalistic resignation about Iran. There are no optimists among the experts,
                        only varying degrees of pessimism. Old Persian hands like Peyton Kerr or
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJW3">John Bowling</persName> really question
                        whether anything we do can arrest the basic trend, evident even before
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM11">Mossadegh</persName>, toward a potentially
                        serious overturn in Iran.</p>
                    <p>Of course I too grant that the odds are against us. We may in fact have to
                        live sooner or later with a chaotic Mossadeqist regime, which <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0289"/>will depose the Shah (if he doesn’t flee),
                        turn neutralist, and be highly vulnerable to Soviet manipulation. But my
                        pitch is that we must nonetheless do all we can to avert this outcome, by
                        backing to the hilt the best alternative available, i.e., Amini. This was
                        the <gloss target="#t_TF1">TF</gloss> recommendation, which the President
                        approved. And we may yet squeak through with a “controlled revolution” as
                        opposed to an uncontrolled one. We won’t, however, unless we give it more of
                        a try.</p>
                    <p>My antennae also detect some worry at State lest the White House “pushed the
                        panic button” because it thinks another cabinet crisis, if not worse, is
                        imminent. I took pains to disabuse this notion. The President’s concern, I
                        said, was to make sure that we are moving on whatever further steps are
                        necessary, and feasible, to buck what everyone agrees is a continued adverse
                        trend. Lead time is essential, since at best it might take months to carry
                        out such measures, given the material we have to work with. This makes it
                        all the more important to get the show on the road.</p>
                    <p>The interim reply due over Friday noon will not be wholly satisfactory.<note n="3" xml:id="d98fn3">See <ref target="#d98fn2">footnote 2</ref>
                            above.</note> It will list a series of steps now under active
                        consideration, but which State is unwilling to recommend firmly until it has
                        consulted Teheran and given further thought. This is fair enough—there are
                        no easy answers to the questions posed, so having stirred up the animals we
                        should give them a bit more time. But our response should be that the
                        President expects a full report no later than two weeks from now (which lets
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Phil Talbot</persName>, who gets to Teheran on 20
                        August, get into the act).</p>
                    <p>In sum, while I still feel we are not yet doing enough, we now have State’s
                        feet to the fire and should give them a chance (I’ll hold off comment on
                        their specific proposals until they are firmer). Meanwhile I intend to keep
                        pushing until told to lay off.</p>

                    <p>On August 18, 1961, in response to a White House request, the Department of
                        State forwarded to the White House a status report on the Saudi arms
                        request, which among other points contained a Department of Defense estimate
                        that it would take from 6 weeks to 6 months to determine definite
                        availability of all items on the Saudi list and might take 8 months or
                        longer to deliver them. (Department of State, Central Files, 786A.56/8–1861)

                        signed <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No. 73, directed to the
                        Secretary of Defense, demanding to know why it would take so long and noting
                        “It seems to me that we could speed this up.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> Files: Lot 72 D 316, <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 73)</p>
                    <p>Following expedited action from the Department of Defense, the Department of
                        State delivered to the Saudi Embassy on September 18 and 20 Letters of Offer
                        covering the greater portion of the arms requested. The United States was
                        unable to provide F–100D jet fighters and B–57B jet bombers owing to their
                        unavailability, but U.S. officials were optimistic that Saudi Arabia would
                        realize that the F–86 fighters that its armed forces were currently using in
                        training were more appropriate for their needs and capabilities. (Memorandum
                        from <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>, September 28; ibid., Central Files,
                        786A.56/9–2861) On October 9, the Department of State sent to the White
                        House for President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>’s
                        information an additional list of arms and equipment the United States was

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnston</persName> described in detail the genesis and results
                        of his efforts in the period 1953–1955 to win Arab and Israeli agreement on
                        a plan for division of the water resources of the Jordan Valley. He said his
                        plan would have irrigated 250,000 acres of land in southern Jordan, employed
                        200,000–250,000 Arab refugees, and would have been a move to “break the back
                        of the refugee problem” and turn Jordan into a viable state. He spoke of
                        having won Arab and Israeli agreement, on a technical level, only to have
                        his plan shelved, as a consequence of political considerations, by an Arab
                        League meeting in 1955.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnston</persName> referred to Israel’s water development
                        since 1955, which by 1963 will put it in a position to divert 60% of the
                        basin’s water resources as contrasted with its 38% allocation under the
                        unified plan. The difference between these two percentages, he said, is the
                        difference between economic viability for Jordan and indefinite dependence
                        on extensive foreign assistance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnston</persName> commented on the East Ghor irrigation
                        project in Jordan which is being financed by the United States. This
                        project, he stated, leaves him apprehensive. Without storage on the Yarmuk
                        (the Maqarin Dam), there will not be enough water in very dry years to
                        satisfy both the Israelis’ customary use of Yarmuk waters in the fertile,
                        Adasiya triangle and the requirements of the newly-irrigated lands in Jordan
                        adjacent to the completed East Ghor Canal. The Maqarin Dam would ensure
                        enough water for both users even in driest years; without it there could be
                        serious dispute.</p>
                    <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0292"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnston</persName> said he had met King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> last fall. King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> had said he would like to go ahead with unified
                        development if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will agree.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> stated that the
                            <persName>Johnston</persName> plan is logical. The talk with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had taken place in the presence of
                        others, precluding detailed conversation, but <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had seemed well-disposed and friendly.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnston</persName> suggested that the United States designate
                        an emissary to visit the Middle East to assess major economic development
                        opportunities in all fields: someone who could talk on a basis of friendship
                        with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Should it prove apparent that their
                        response is negative, the whole idea could be dropped with no disadvantage
                        to this country. If the climate seems favorable, the emissary could try to
                        put across the Maqarin Dam. With this project once underway, the atmosphere
                        would be propitious for an effort to win Arab and Israeli agreement on
                        Tiberias storage and on adoption of the other aspects of the unified plan.
                        In the long run, the success of this effort might dissuade Israel from
                        seizing 60% of the basin’s water resources. If Israel balks, a persuasive
                        approach to Israel’s supporters in this country might induce a more
                        responsive attitude on its part.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said a recent
                        meeting of United States Ambassadors in the Middle East, held in
                            Nicosia,<note n="1" xml:id="d100fn1">See <ref target="#d91">Documents
                                91</ref> and <ref target="#d92">92</ref>.</note> had given detailed
                        consideration to the Jordan waters problem, particularly in regard to the
                        timing of a further American initiative. Mr. <persName>Johnston</persName>’s
                        own “heroic” efforts on this problem had been overwhelmingly approved and
                        much of the Ambassadors’ thinking on ways of making progress now had been
                        very close to the views just expressed by Mr. <persName>Johnston</persName>.
                        However, the consensus of those familiar with this problem is that because
                        of prevailing Arab suspicions of the United States, it may be best if the
                        Arabs turn to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> for assistance in
                        construction of the Maqarin Dam. After that project is underway, we can
                        consider how to get back to other aspects of the problem. At the present
                        juncture it seems important for the United States to stay out, if only
                        because, as Mr. <persName>Johnston</persName> may be aware, the United
                        States is already engaged in a “small initiative” in regard to the refugee
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnston</persName> asked if there is any indication of
                        Jordanian interest in an approach to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and what <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
                        reaction is likely to be.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that we
                        have received some indication of Jordanian interest, and have no reason to
                        believe that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would be opposed
                        to an Arab approach to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. It is
                        hoped that the Department can keep in close touch with Mr.
                            <persName>Johnston</persName> as this situation develops.</p>
                    <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0293"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnston</persName> said the important thing is to get the
                        Maqarin Dam done, not who does it.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that
                        “we have to feel our way— see what can be done in an international forum”
                        before again seeking to inject the United States into the situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnston</persName> asked who would pay for the Maqarin Dam
                        since the project, costing some $40 million exclusive of a $20 million
                        hydro-electric component, is not a bankable loan.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that we
                        have not only the Bank but the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>. From
                        whatever several sources, the money will have to be found. Whatever is built
                        will, above all, reflect Mr. <persName>Johnston</persName>’s own truly epic
                        efforts in past years.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George</persName></hi>:
                        In my conversation with you this morning I failed to discuss what I consider
                        to be one of the most important aspects of the Jordan Valley development—an
                        international control system for the whole waterway. Such a system was
                        originally set up and agreed upon, and is vital if each of the countries is
                        to get its share of the water as outlined in the original plan.</p>
                    <p>Under this program Jordan was to receive all the water from the Yarmuk, less
                        the original riparian rights of Israel in the Jordan-Yarmuk triangle plus 70
                        to 100 mcms. of water from the Jordan River itself. This additional water
                        from the Jordan River is vital if you are to proceed to irrigate the west
                        Ghor of the Jordan Valley in Jordan.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the Israelis are in a position to start pumping it is obvious that
                        they will not be interested in any water master going up and down the river,
                        checking on any amount of water taken. Nor could the Jordanians be persuaded
                        to store water in Lake Tiberias.</p>
                    <p>Although approximately 400 mcms. of water can be stored at Maqarin at a high
                        cost, to try to store the balance of the Yarmuk water by <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0294"/>damsites on the river would be prohibitive.
                        Loss to the Kingdom of Jordan of the right to store 300 mcms. of water from
                        the Yarmuk in Lake Tiberias, plus the loss of 70 to 100 mcms. of water from
                        the Jordan River, would make it useless to try to irrigate the west Ghor of
                        the Jordan Valley in the Kingdom of Jordan. This would mean that only a
                        little over half of the potential Arab refugees could be put on the land,
                        making this problem more difficult to solve, and that the Kingdom of Jordan
                        would lose the opportunity of becoming a self-supporting and viable
                        state.</p>
                    <p>Whoever or however the new approach is handled it is vital that international
                        control of the river system be effected soon. It is not important who does
                        this; but it is important that whoever does, must assume the responsibility
                        for instituting an international control system.</p>
                    <p>I have sufficient confidence in what we were able to achieve in our
                        negotiations in terms of an equitable distribution of the waters of the
                        system and the economic development of the area that history will prove us
                        right, and in that confidence I will, of course, always be ready to be of
                        any assistance and render any advice that I can.</p>
                    <p>I appreciate your courtesies to me this morning.</p>
                    <p>With warmest best wishes, I am</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Armin</persName></hi>:
                        I have your highly important letter of August 12<note n="1" xml:id="d102fn1">See Enclosure 1 to <ref target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note> and
                        welcome the opportunity to convey my views on the far-reaching problems and
                        questions it raises. Before proceeding to take these up, however, I believe
                        it would be useful to set forth briefly an evaluation of the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government and its future
                        prospects.</p>
                    <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0295"/>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government has now been in
                        power for 3–1/2 months. Its advent was unanticipated both in that the
                        collapse of the <persName corresp="#p_EJS2">Sharif-Emami</persName>
                        government was sudden and unexpected, and in that the selection of a man
                        long critical of the Shah to head a government of the Shah was somewhat of a
                        surprise. Despite <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s long record
                        of criticism of previous governments and his well-known desire to become
                        Prime Minister, it was evident upon his accession to office that the
                        unexpected development caught him unprepared for the job both as regards
                        having a program and a nucleus of capable individuals to help him discharge
                        the heavy task he assumed. This was one of the reasons that the first two
                        months of the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> regime were
                        marked by confusion, contradiction, and lack of coordination within the
                        government, and by uncertainty on the part of the Prime Minister with
                        respect to the best way to proceed to achieve his objectives. In addition,
                        there was the normal confusion attendant upon a change in administration.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> had also to struggle with
                        the basic problem of his relationship with the Shah, with the serious
                        economic problems facing the country, and with critical political matters
                        such as the question of elections and of how to handle the National Front.
                        Complicating this task even further was his lack of knowledge of the
                        commitments and undertakings of previous governments, some of which are
                        arising to plague him even as late as now, and of the plunder which had gone
                        on.</p>
                    <p>The combination of these factors would overwhelm any man. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> furthermore must work in the Persian
                        atmosphere and must deal principally with other Persians in attempting to
                        resolve the problems facing him. I need not dwell in this letter on those
                        aspects of their character which make it so hard for Iranians to work
                        together, to plan for the future, and to take drastic action when drastic
                        action is necessary.</p>
                    <p>It is not for want of personal will that the Prime Minister has not yet
                        solved the problems facing him. He has approached his task with
                        determination and courage and a good deal of skill, and is working himself
                        to the point of exhaustion. With our invaluable assistance he is progressing
                        toward the solution of the economic problems which beset Iran and which must
                        be solved before any genuine progress can be made in the direction of a
                        basically improved political situation. He has established a working
                        arrangement with the Shah whereby he has skillfully obtained the Monarch’s
                        support for unpalatable but necessary measures. He has toned down some of
                        his ministers whose inflammatory statements were causing an unnecessary
                        degree of alarm. The Prime Minister is no longer actively opposed by the
                        principal military elements despite having taken action against important
                        military figures on charges of corruption. He has been unable to reach an
                        understanding with the National Front and has felt required to take firm,
                        but not brutal, measures which <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0296"/>have
                        disconcerted and disorganized the Front to the point where at the moment it
                        is not in a position to cause serious trouble.</p>
                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> came into office there was
                        general enthusiasm over the selection of a man who, although a member of the
                        conservative group, was considered sympathetic with the interests and needs
                        of the people as a whole and known as a strong critic of the Shah and of
                        previous governments. This enthusiasm existed despite the realization here
                        in Iran that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> was very
                        unlikely to be a “revolutionary” Prime Minister in the Nationalist sense. It
                        was unfortunately largely based on expectations of actions and reforms which
                        could not be quickly taken in the light of the nature of things in Iran. It
                        was not long after the advent of the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government that the traditional Persian tendency to
                        suspect and criticize the government in power reasserted itself and this,
                        combined with failure of expectations to be rapidly met, led to a decline in
                        support for the government among liberal politically conscious elements. In
                        particular, the failure of the Prime Minister, for sound reasons in my view,
                        to meet the demands of the National Front for immediate elections and
                        unimpeded political action led to the alienation by the government of the
                        elements sympathetic to Mosadeq. This despite the sincere efforts which Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> made to obtain the
                        cooperation of moderate National Front leaders, who rejected his
                        request.</p>
                    <p>However, at the moment of writing, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> seems to possess the support or the acquiescence of at
                        least the following elements necessary to his continuation in office—the
                        Shah, the military, and the conservative civilian elements. He is making
                        continuous efforts to broaden this basis of support to include such elements
                        as the bazaar, the clergy and labor, and in his own view is having a measure
                        of success. Barring some unforeseen development such as a most secretly
                        organized coup, or the Prime Minister’s own resignation or incapacitation
                        owing to frustration or the deterioration of his health because of the
                        burden he is carrying, I anticipate his remaining in office for a
                        considerable period, providing that we continue the help we are giving him.
                        Without this he has frankly said he could not have survived. I agree with
                        you that the Iranian government faces no immediate and crucial political
                        crises involving possible revolution.</p>
                    <p>I turn now from the current and relatively short term future aspects of the
                        situation to the longer term political outlook which is the primary purpose
                        of your letter. You state that your reading of the situation is most
                        disquieting. Although I agree that the obstacles in the way of establishing
                        a more stable political basis in Iran are formidable, I do not now fully
                        share the apparent deep concern reflected in your letter. For one reason, I
                        do not see how anybody, and particularly a Persian dealing with Persians,
                        could have begun to make significant progress towards this goal in the
                        chaotic situation in which the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>
                        regime came into <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0297"/>office and in the
                        short time it has been in power. The Prime Minister has, during this period,
                        been forced to devote all his energies to the problems of making his
                        government a going concern, of ameliorating the grave economic situation, of
                        establishing a working relationship with the Shah, and in general of
                        arresting the slide toward political and economic collapse which was evident
                        before he came into office. I strongly believe that it is unreasonable to
                        expect notable progress towards so difficult a future political goal until
                        current political and economic problems have been resolved to the point
                        where a tranquil and sound atmosphere will permit political reforms, which
                        are in themselves unsettling, to be tackled. Despite the compromises he has
                        made, I do not at all believe that the Prime Minister has abandoned the
                        goals which he announced when he became Prime Minister. I think that he has
                        come to the conclusion, which I share, that these goals can only be attained
                        over a considerable period of time and that their accomplishment would be
                        greatly delayed, if not rendered impossible, if it were sought by hasty
                        steps from the basis of a new and untried government which had not solved
                        the important current problems of government stability and financial and
                        economic viability.</p>
                    <p>Assuming that the Prime Minister remains in office for a sufficient amount of
                        time and is able to solve his pressing current problems, I believe that he
                        will devote his attention, hopefully with some degree of success, to the
                        basic political problem which is the object of our concern. In this we can
                        be of help to him by aiding him in his material difficulties while largely
                        leaving him, as a Persian dealing with other Persians and with Persian
                        political problems, to solve the latter in the way he deems most likely to
                        be successful. Steps which might seem logical to non-Iranian outside
                        observers will, I am convinced, in many instances not be found to be
                        appropriate in this process.</p>
                    <p>The second important reason why I do not share the degree of concern
                        reflected in your letter arises from my evaluation, since I have been in
                        Iran, of the degree of urgency of the primary preoccupation you have
                        stated—the need to bridge, through the creation of some sort of a new and
                        moderate centrist political synthesis, the gap between the largely
                        neo-Mosadeqist elements of the urban middle class and the more traditional
                        and conservative elements of society. The former elements, while highly
                        vocal and critical, possess no unity among themselves. They are not so
                        strong, nor are they likely to be in the next several years, as to be able
                        to take power here without important military collaboration. The only
                        singleness of purpose they have is to take over. They cannot agree on a
                        political program. They cannot be said to have a popular following because
                        they put forward a positive program but because, rather, they provide the
                        only outlet for the manifestation of discontent, arising as much as anything
                        from economic distress. The assumption by these <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0298"/>people of even a degree of power at this time would have a
                        profoundly negative effect on the stability of Iran and on our interests
                        here. The inclusion of the more moderate of them in a government would have
                        no significant positive political effect, failing the relief of the
                        underlying political and economic grievances which provide the principal
                        basis of the attraction exercised by the National Front.</p>
                    <p>In making the above statement I risk being accused of favoring the
                        maintenance of the status quo, and of discounting the pressures for basic
                        changes. To the contrary, I believe that it is inevitable that the middle
                        class eventually will come into power in this country, and that what we must
                        hope and work for is that this process shall be an orderly one. I think
                        there is a fairly good chance that, with luck, it will be achieved by
                        gradual change, not by dramatic or violent action, in response to pressures
                        from politically conscious elements. Results of this pressure, admittedly
                        not basic ones, have become visible in the last year. The fact that the
                        Prime Minister has not made solid progress in building a bridge between the
                        middle class and the conservatives in three months’ time should not, I
                        think, be taken as a cause of grave concern by the United States government.
                        If it should become clear beyond a doubt that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> had given up the struggle and had
                        reverted to the attitude of his predecessors, then there would be cause for
                        concern. Assuming as I do that he has not, there probably will be time for
                        him, or some successor, to adjust the basic political situation to conform
                        to current pressures, assuming their continuing will to do so.</p>
                    <p>I further believe that when the time comes that power has shifted to the
                        middle class, the latter will exercise that power not through a democratic
                        and representative form of government as we understand it. The political
                        history of Persia, and the character of the Persian people, lead me to the
                        conviction that the most likely and probably the most suitable form of
                        government for this country is one where the people are firmly and
                        resolutely guided by a central authority not subject to the daily whims of
                        representatives of the disunited, highly individualistic, and uncooperative
                        people of this nation.</p>
                    <p>While I therefore do not experience the sense of urgency reflected in your
                        letter regarding the timing of the bridging of the gap between conservative
                        and middle class elements, I hope I have made clear my agreement that the
                        gap has to be bridged. The representatives of the middle class now
                        constitute only potentially a serious menace to the regime. The threat which
                        they do represent will be greatly alleviated if stable economic conditions,
                        accompanied by administrative reforms, can be brought about with our
                        assistance. For the time being this will be the principal field in which we
                        can offer effective aid. We should not at the same time undertake political
                        pressures which would have the effect of stirring up the middle class and
                        arousing their expectations, thereby <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0299"/>disturbing the stability and equilibrium of a pro-Western government which
                        is struggling to remove the obstacles standing in the way of an attack by it
                        on longer-range political problems. We must accept the reality that the
                        solution of the latter is going to take a long time and will require
                        continuing patience, help, and understanding on our part. It may well take
                        the decade you envisage. Meanwhile, we will probably continue to be faced
                        with frustrations in dealing with the Iranians, and with a return of
                        somewhat less than 100% on our aid dollar. The political importance of our
                        position in Iran, and the strategic significance of the country, are
                        indubitably such as to require us to bear these disadvantages. I believe
                        what we receive in return is worth it.</p>
                    <p>You have asked what <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> can do and
                        what we can do to help him meet his country’s political and economic
                        problems in such a way as to better the long-term prospects for evolutionary
                        progress. I think that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s
                        basic ideas about improvement of these prospects are sound in both the
                        economic and political fields, that is to say, briefly, his ideas about
                        fiscal responsibility, economic stability, increased competence and
                        efficiency in government, anti-corruption, land reform and an improved
                        judicial system, and establishing broader popular support for the
                        government. His interest in improving the lot of the individual Iranian, and
                        in working for social justice here, is as deep as ever. As I have already
                        said, it is clear that to make progress in the long run he must be
                        successful in the short run in these problems that test him so severely
                        today. We believe that the most acute as well as immediate strictly
                        political problem is the one of elections. I foresee nothing but bad results
                        stemming from the holding of another set of elections in this country within
                        the next year, given on the one hand the manner in which elections probably
                        have to be held and on the other our belief that two national elections in a
                        six-months period contributed greatly to the upset situation which brought
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> into power. The problem
                        that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> faces is how to stave
                        off elections for a considerable period without thereby generating equally
                        bad results. It seems to me that his problem will become particularly acute
                        when the University is back in session a month or two from now, considering
                        the extraordinary role which the University students can be stimulated to
                        play in contemporary Iranian politics. I can only conclude, tentatively at
                        least, that the situation thus demands increased activity in the
                        anti-corruption front and active preparation for progress in the field of
                        land reform as a means of directing the attention of the University students
                        somewhat from the issue of elections. Putting it more broadly, although I
                        believe that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> tamped down
                        some of the almost revolutionary fervor of the first days of his
                        administration for what seemed sound practical reasons, I think he should
                        now make further efforts in these two particular <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0300"/>fields, in order to gain wider support and to divert
                        attention from the election problem.</p>
                    <p>I plan therefore in the near future to discuss this matter of potential
                        student trouble over elections with the Prime Minister and thereafter if
                        necessary and desirable with the Shah. Although I doubt the advisability of
                        a role for the United States in such matters beyond that of moral support
                        and friendly advice, this should be not without value to a man as sorely
                        beset as Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> or taken amiss by
                        the Shah.</p>
                    <p>“To play for time and hope for the best” is certainly an acceptable policy in
                        certain desperate circumstances. While no one knows what is going to happen
                        in countries like Iran and there will probably be no time in the foreseeable
                        future when we can afford to feel relaxed about the situation, I do not
                        think that circumstances here should as yet be described as desperate. After
                        less than three months here I would venture to say that the Persians have a
                        better than even chance of keeping their society intact while concurrently
                        making such adjustments as are required by changing circumstances both
                        outside and inside. They are quite capable, of course, of destroying
                        themselves, but my guess is that they will not.</p>
                    <p>I am forwarding separately our comments on the <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> study which accompanied your letter.</p>
                    <p>The remainder of your letter dealt with economic problems, especially the
                        budget, and asked for my comments. I understand your viewpoint to be that in
                        the months ahead the Iranian economic situation will be sufficiently
                        stabilized to permit <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> to
                        concentrate his energies on political and psychological problems, that
                        German aid will virtually eliminate the need for further U.S. ad hoc
                        financing assistance to complete the Second Plan, and that no real need for
                        budgetary assistance over and above the $15 million already discussed with
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will be necessary. While I do not
                        visualize catastrophes in the economic field, I am somewhat less sanguine
                        about the economic outlook than may be implied by this assessment.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has been heavily troubled by
                        economic problems since the beginning of his administration. His economic
                        inheritance was a mess—the economy was faltering, the foreign exchange
                        reserves were virtually exhausted, prices were moving upward, the budget was
                        in substantial deficit, stabilization goals had been seriously breached, and
                        over-all administrative efficiency was, even for Iran, at low ebb. With the
                        help of U.S. emergency assistance he surmounted the immediate crisis
                        confronting his Government and he has subsequently made some progress with
                        more basic economic issues. This has, however, involved a heavy expenditure
                        of his time and energies.</p>
                    <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0301"/>
                    <p>Iranian economic and administrative problems are too deep-rooted to lend
                        themselves to quick and clear solutions. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> believes, and I share his opinion, that it will take
                        at least 18 months to establish a viable economic and financial situation in
                        this country. The economy is in a soft condition, marked by a sharp drop in
                        investments, some industrial dislocation, and rising unemployment. Economic
                        uncertainty is widespread. Landlords, peasants, merchants, contractors and
                        workers all have reason for dissatisfaction with the policies and
                        performance of the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> Government.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>, in turn, is confronted
                        with a serious dilemma in respect to economic objectives. With his limited
                        foreign exchange reserves leaving little room for maneuver, he wishes to
                        restore balance in the country’s internal and external accounts primarily by
                        means of the credit restraints involved in the stabilization program. This
                        policy, however, has tended to intensify the liquidity problem in commercial
                        and industrial circles and to contribute to unemployment. Relaxation of the
                        stabilization effort would ease the domestic liquidity situation but it
                        would be reflected in further demand pressures on the thin foreign exchange
                        reserves and a further blocking of access to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> standby credits.</p>
                    <p>No single problem has occupied as much of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s time as the formulation of the 1340 Budget which was
                        finally passed on August 16. While the indicated deficit of 2,616 million
                        rials appears over-stated, it is difficult to predict with assurance what
                        the final outcome of the Government’s fiscal operations will be. However,
                        having taken the considerations cited in your letter into account but
                        without going into detail on this occasion, I feel that <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> is likely to have a hard core deficit
                        of at least 1.5 billion rials ($20 million). This subject will be dealt with
                        in a further communication.</p>
                    <p>Earlier information from Bonn in connection with the Federal Republic’s
                        contribution to the financing of the Second Plan gap was, as you have
                        stated, surprisingly favorable. Our enthusiasm on this score, however, has
                        been somewhat dampened as a result of our review of the Protocol signed in
                        Bonn and our conversations with Iranian officials. On the face of the
                        Protocol itself, it now appears that the usable German contribution to the
                        Second Plan period may not exceed $20 million, that the arrangements with
                        the <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> may hurt, rather than help, the
                        1340 Budget position and that problems may arise with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> resulting from the intention of the <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> to push ahead immediately with the $175
                        million new construction program. However, reports of discussions between
                        Embassy Bonn and German officials concerned with the negotiations indicated
                        German understanding of the need to maximize disbursements within the limits
                        of the loan for the Second Plan projects (namely up to $36 million). Until
                        the final position of the Germans on this matter is clarified, we will not
                        know the extent to which <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0302"/>the
                        Iranians will turn to us for further development assistance to complete the
                        financing of the Second Plan.</p>
                    <p>In sum, there appears at this time to be a continuing need for budgetary and
                        development support substantially in excess of the levels indicated in your
                        letter.</p>
                    <p>I am afraid this is a rather long reply, but the questions you raised were so
                        basic that I believed they should be thoroughly treated in the
                            response.<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">On September 9, <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> forwarded to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> at the National Security Council

                        United Arab Republic, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Gamal Abdel
                            Nasser</persName>, which was personally delivered to the Department of

                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>’s call on the
                            Department.<note n="1" xml:id="d103fn1">Neither printed. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s letter is dated August

                    <p>The letter appears to conform to the pattern of the replies from other Arab
                        leaders, viz: (a) the Arabs are appreciative of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>’s letter; (b) in replying,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> felt it necessary to
                        make the usual remarks about Israel; and (c) the Arab countries nevertheless
                        continue to leave the door open as far as movement on the Palestine question
                        is concerned.</p>
                    <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0303"/>
                    <p>The letter is lengthy and rambling. Factually, it appears to be generally
                        accurate. Frequent references are made for [<hi rend="italic">to</hi>] our
                        past support of the Israeli cause in reviewing the history of United States
                        relations with the United Arab Republic. However, the letter broadens its
                        context beyond Israel and places considerable stress on new forces of
                        revolution and nationalism in the Middle East with which President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> believes the United States should
                        accommodate itself. President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        apparently believes that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> is appreciative of these new forces and seems to
                        have considerable hope that, in the future, United States policies will
                        recognize these forces. Recognition is given to United States assistance to
                        his country during the Suez crisis and economic aid in the form of wheat
                        shipments and loans that have been provided since 1958.</p>
                    <p>An expression of gratitude to the Soviet Union for its help in meeting United
                        Arab Republic defense requirements is also included. The forthrightness with
                        which this is asserted is probably in the interest of keeping the message
                        balanced and as a means of answering any Soviet protests that might arise
                        over the message’s otherwise friendly tone.</p>
                    <p>In general, given Arab bitterness regarding Israel and the fact that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> must assume that his
                        letter will eventually be published, we believe that the letter is
                        extraordinarily warm in tone, mild in language, forthcoming, and hopeful for
                        the relations of the two countries in the future. It is quite clear that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> wants to have
                        friendly and continuing contacts with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>. The letter does not refer to the present approach
                        of the Palestine Conciliation Commission but, by its very absence, it does
                        not close the door to further initiatives with respect to the Palestine
                        question.</p>
                    <p>The Department’s recommendations concerning a reply to the letter will be
                        forwarded shortly.<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">On September 8, the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Ros</hi>: We have read with interest your letter of
                        August 14 forwarding an analysis of the probable impact of the acquisition
                        by Israel of a nuclear weapons capability.<note n="1" xml:id="d104fn1">See

                            thereto.</note></p>
                    <p>This is, as you are aware, a subject we have followed with the greatest
                        attention. We have indicated to Israel at a high level on several occasions
                        our opposition to proliferation of nuclear weapons capabilities. As you
                        know, we sought, and eventually gained, the opportunity to examine the
                        Dimona installation. This examination satisfied us that, for the present,
                        the Government of Israel is not actively engaged in programs aimed at
                        nuclear weapons production. We fully intend to press for future examinations
                        of this sort at appropriate intervals. In addition, the President has been
                        assured by Prime Minister Ben-Gurion that Israel agrees in principle to
                        international visits to its nuclear installations by reputable neutral
                        scientists. Arrangements for such visits are being discussed with the
                        Government of Israel.</p>
                    <p>Should future developments make this appear desirable, we would not hesitate
                        to re-affirm to Israel in strong terms our belief that it is not in the
                        interest of Israel or of this country that Israel engage in programs aimed
                        at nuclear weapons production. [<hi rend="italic">2–1/2 lines of source text

                    <p>I am hopeful that our continued close attention to this problem along the
                        lines indicated above will prevent the development of a nuclear weapons
                        capacity by Israel.</p>

                    <p>A meeting of the Iran Task Force was called by the Chairman for 3:00 p.m.,
                        September 7, 1961, to be held in Room 5514, NS. Prior to the meeting, copies

                    <p>[Here follows a list of the 28 officials at the meeting.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> opened the meeting with a
                        description of his recent visit to Iran and his talks with Iranian and
                        American officials. The Shah was ebullient and articulate, but seemed far
                        more interested and excited over military matters than over Iran’s political
                        or economic difficulties. He emphasized the difference in the level of U.S.
                        aid to Iran and to Turkey. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>
                        in reply had emphasized to the Shah the importance of Iran’s balancing total
                        resources against total needs.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister had not been prepared as to details when he was called
                        upon to assume office. He must meet his problems piecemeal. In the immediate
                        future, political threats to the Prime Minister’s objectives are secondary
                        to the economic threats. Apparently his relations with the Shah are good,
                        and <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> hopes to gain even greater
                        support from the Shah on a wide range of issues. He believes that early
                        elections would have catastrophic results; apparently there is growing
                        interest in Iranian official circles in something like Ayub’s “guided
                        democracy” theme. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> does not seem
                        to possess the characteristics of a charismatic popular leader, but he has a
                        good realization of the problems confronting him, is a realist, and is
                        overworked and worried. He does not appear to have a good staff. If he can
                        meet his immediate problems, there is a possibility that a vague body of
                        support can crystallize behind him. He has reduced the military danger to
                        his regime; the possibility of a military coup against him is small, since
                        the military leaders seem now ready to go along with him, and have modified
                        their original <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0306"/>resentment and
                        distrust. Other rightist elements seem somewhat more reconciled to <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> than they were a few months ago,
                        although they still hate and fear Agriculture Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH10">Arsenjani</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has not had corresponding success as regards the
                        opposition of the “left”, the National Front and similar groups. The Front
                        is badly fragmented, and the government’s firm but gentle show of force on
                        30 Tir seems to have disheartened the Front, which is uncertain whether the
                        Prime Minister is “really bad or just ordinarily bad”. In any case there is
                        at present little sign of coalesced organized National Front resistance to
                        the government. The dangers of a serious political break between the Shah
                        and the Prime Minister are lessening. There is little sign of either pro- or
                            anti-<persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> activity.</p>
                    <p>The fiscal and economic situation in Iran is more depressing. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> inherited a confused and inefficient
                        fiscal organization. The Army and the Shah press for more funds for the
                        military; up to $60 million remains as a gap in the financing of the Second
                        Plan; and the recently negotiated German aid will apparently only cover $20
                        million of that gap. The current budget, for the year half over, shows a
                        deficit of between $20 and $40 million, and its preparation has been marked
                        by a great deal of confusion and inefficiency. Better budgetary control
                        requires something in the nature of a Budget Bureau, which the Prime
                        Minister is now driving toward. Perhaps by next year a minimum of fiscal
                        discipline will have been introduced. Local government is weak and
                        ineffective while the Third Plan calls for great responsibility on the part
                        of local government units. There is a vague and confusing overlap between
                        the functions of the Plan Organization and the Ministries. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> seems determined to move ahead with
                        due regard for the law on the problem of corruption in the government, and
                        has been permitted by the Shah to bring up the names of Royal Court
                        officials as necessary in the coming trials. He is genuinely concerned over
                        land reform, but without adequate government services and finance to take
                        over the functions of the landlords, the task will be slow and difficult.
                        Tax reform is moving, but slowly. Iran is not in good health. The U.S. will
                        have to slowly nurse it along, but must avoid creating a sense of dependence
                        on U.S. aid. The Iranian infrastructure, starting from near zero, has
                        improved and is improving. Iran is worth an effort on the part of the U.S.,
                        but no panaceas are in sight, and there are no grand slam solutions to its
                        deeply-rooted problems. Iran, incidentally, appeared to be considerably more
                        modernized and prosperous, both in the city and the countryside, than is
                        India.</p>
                    <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0307"/>
                    <p>On Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>’s request, Mr.
                            Miklos<note n="2" xml:id="d105fn2">Of the Bureau of Near Eastern and
                            South Asian Affairs.</note> briefed the Task Force on the economic
                        situation. Mr. Miklos emphasized that as regards the financing of the Second
                        Plan, we cannot request additional U.S. development lending until we are
                        certain what the final result of German aid lending will be. Our Ambassador
                        is pushing for a government-wide Iranian evaluation of the exact meaning of
                        the German aid protocol, and for a reopening by the Iranians of the
                        negotiations if this evaluation shows the present protocol to be as
                        unhelpful as is presently indicated. At such time, we would be able to back
                        up the Iranian request to the Germans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Welk<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">Of the Export-Import Bank.</note> asked
                        Mr. Miklos why we should not approach the Germans now, and Mr. Miklos
                        replied that we felt it would be improper for us to do so until the Iranians
                        themselves had opened the question.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Miklos went on to say that it now appeared far more likely than it did a
                        few weeks ago that we would have to support the Iranian budget for the
                        current year, but that we could not pinpoint the requirement until after a
                        joint U.S.-Iranian task force in Tehran had completed a detailed analysis of
                        the budget problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> said that he detected in the
                        Task Force a “cycle of concern”. We looked ahead a few months ago with great
                        concern, taking a long-range point of view. Now that we note that Iran is
                        getting along from day to day, coping with its immediate problems, we must
                        keep in mind the long-range prognosis. Perhaps the Embassy, in its reply now
                        before the Task Force, is slightly more optimistic than we have been. The
                        problem is, granting the necessity of full support of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s long-range problem—what can we do?
                        There can be no sudden quick solution. Our actions will probably have to be
                        many and small, and some of them may not work, and even have unfavorable
                        results. I am somewhat reassured by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>’s impressions, and it appears that there is no
                        immediate crisis in Iran. There is the question of lead time, however, both
                        as regards the delays inevitably encountered both in our government and in
                        that of Iran, on the implementation of new action programs. I think we
                        should consider what we should start now which may not come to fruition for
                        a long time but which will assist in meeting long-range problems. If
                        political prospects in Iran are reasonably bright, then a liberal U.S.
                        response to Iran’s economic and financial needs is indicated.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that he felt Iran was
                        definitely in a crisis, but that the crisis was not solely of politics or of
                        economics, but of political economy, and that the current evidences of the
                        crisis are in the fiscal aspects of the political economy of Iran. We must
                        not forget that unless the day-to-day crises are overcome, the long-range
                        chances will be lost, and I still feel <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0308"/>that the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>
                        regime offers the best long-range hope for Iran. The question of political
                        glamorization of the regime is probably not as important as the improvement
                        of the institutional structure, which would provide <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> with better tools and freedom to act
                        on the long-range political problems.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d105fn4">Of the Bureau of the Budget.</note> remarked that he was only in Iran
                        for about eight hours, but he did get to talk at length with several
                        officials. The central problem of the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government is that it did not know the nature of its
                        instrumentalities, such as the abysmally incompetent Finance Ministry. The
                        installation of a Budget Bureau will solve nothing in itself. Will the
                        budget bureau have real control over funds, control based on sound financial
                        and economic plans? Should the Plan Organization control the capital budget
                        or should the hypothetical “budget bureau” act on the basis of a plan?
                        Putting real power into the Prime Minister’s office is no answer until you
                        see who is wielding that power. The key institution is economic
                        planning.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Lardner<note n="5" xml:id="d105fn5">Of the Office of the Assistant
                            Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs.</note> asked if
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> had seen any indication of
                        improved fiscal control measures in the Iranian military. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> replied that it appeared that there
                        was attention being given to the problem and that there was some movement,
                        but few signs of solid progress.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> then distributed copies of
                        a draft memorandum (copy attached)<note n="6" xml:id="d105fn6">Not
                            printed.</note> to the White House from the Department of State which
                        constituted a reply to the White House memorandum of August 7,<note n="7" xml:id="d105fn7"><ref target="#d94">Document 94</ref>.</note> and which
                        was based largely upon the Embassy’s letters of August 27 and invited a
                        discussion of the Embassy’s letters.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> said that the Embassy’s
                        document is essentially a do-nothing approach, advocating no political
                        action but waiting for the dust to settle. The document can only be termed a
                        negative analysis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> said that we must decide
                        whether or not we are doing all that we can. He felt that there were two
                        basic alternative attitudes which we could take. We could either say that we
                        are now doing what we can, or we could take an active attitude by launching
                        further follow-on actions beyond what we are now doing but in the general
                        direction of the Task Force’s earlier actions. The first course is doubtless
                        defensible, but I favor the second.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> remarked that another way
                        of putting it is that we can either shore up <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>, recognizing that he can best solve his own problems
                        in his own way, or we can go in closely with action programs, <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0309"/>sitting down with <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> and telling him that if he takes such
                        and such a specific action, we will take such and such an action. If we take
                        this bold approach it is true that we commit ourselves. But the Embassy’s
                        reply and this draft memorandum reflect negativism and the passive approach
                        to a problem. Could we not direct the students of Iran to positive attitudes
                        and actions? Could we not work actively with moderate middle class elements
                        fighting corruption? Fiscal reform must be a clear condition of United
                        States aid. Are we ready to come to grips with the problem of the military?
                        We should immediately devise a program for land reform legislation, laying
                        the problem of land distribution temporarily aside. The Embassy’s approach
                        is a negativistic defense of the status quo, and conveys no sense of
                        crisis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thurston<note n="8" xml:id="d105fn8">Of the Department of State’s
                            Operations Center.</note> said that it seemed to him a basic question as
                        to whether or not we wanted to build our program around the Shah, or to work
                        for a reduction in the power of the Shah.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that the Task Force
                        had built its original recommendations around Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>, with the goal of broadening the
                        power base in Iran in the direction of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister
                        and away from the Shah.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bennett<note n="9" xml:id="d105fn9">Of the International Cooperation
                            Administration.</note> said that perhaps other financial measures are
                        still unexplored, and that the flight of capital may be a hole in the
                        barrel. Better financial controls in Iran would possibly reduce the demand
                        on our own resources. Perhaps we could force the formation of a committee to
                        manage Iran’s external financial resources and prevent drains on our
                        resources; too little attention has been given to remedial measures.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Spain said that the main pressures on the Iranian government sprang from
                        the Nationalist Left. Without consideration of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s competence in handling financial problems, there is
                        grave doubt that he is capable of handling this opposition, which is only
                        temporarily quiescent. The hypothesis that political problems could be set
                        aside in favor of the solution of financial and economic issues is open to
                        question. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s political base of
                        support is becoming narrower, but can we not take more positive action on
                        remedial measures on the problem of leftist pressures? If I were <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>, I would have gone much further left
                        than <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> did; I would not, for
                        example, have muzzled <persName corresp="#p_AH10">Arsenjani</persName>.
                        Perhaps some degree of increase in the power of the National Front would be
                        useful.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Stoops<note n="10" xml:id="d105fn10">Of the Development Loan Fund.</note>
                        said that each year for years we have talked of fiscal reforms in Iran but
                        we end up by bailing the Iranians out again without any reforms. Unless we
                        can drive home the necessity of reforms, Iran will not be in the Free World
                        for long.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that we are faced with
                        the problem of immediate action in Iran to face an immediate crisis. We have
                        had a gendarmerie mission in Iran for twenty years, but the gendarmerie
                        still takes bribes. The question is not just whether or not to continue
                        subsidizing Iran. The essence of the problem in Iran is one of social
                        discipline and the nature of the political forces there. It is not a
                        question of whether or not we give budget support. It is a question of
                        whether or not we can work at improving the institutional structure while we
                        continue to assist the regime financially. Institutional improvements as
                        they occur will improve the political situation. Political and economic
                        actions are interrelated. Our Ambassador is continually pounding hard at the
                        Prime Minister as to the necessity of action on the malaise of fiscal
                        control, on the demonstration of government sincerity in the corruption
                        cases, and so on.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> said that the Embassy’s
                        comments indicate that it expects little response from these pressures. In
                        the past, we have been credited with huge influence even when we had very
                        little. I advocate our overt association with political change in an orderly
                        comprehensive way with specific prescriptions for positive programs. We must
                        provide the direction for these programs, even to the point of public
                        association with them, in which case we would at least be blamed for what we
                        actually do, not, as in the past, for everything that happens. Desirable
                        action programs would consist of a statement of our objectives, the way in
                        which the program is to be advanced, and a statement of the nature and
                        extent of our assistance in advancing the program. The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> stabilization program is essentially good,
                        and is the kind of thing I am talking about. The Embassy’s response to our
                        questions is extremely disappointing to me.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Welk suggested that if such approaches be tried they be tried in areas
                        least likely to cause a political disaster.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> replied that the action
                        program must be a broad one which would involve risks of all kinds.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Welk suggested that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName>
                        provide the Task Force with a more specific outline of just what he had in
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> said that one can’t make
                        such detailed and realistic plans from Washington. They have to come from
                        the Country Team, and I see in this response little to make me sanguine
                        about realistic planning coming from that source.</p>
                    <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0311"/>

                        suggested four courses of action which might improve the situation and which
                        we have not yet attempted. First, a strong U.S. attempt to influence Iranian
                        students and teachers through influencing international student and teacher
                        groups with U.S. components; Second, to shore up <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> through influencing the intelligence positions of
                        friendly governments; Third, to realign our aid to Iran and coordinate it in
                        the direction of the building of lightly armed military organizations
                        effective in maintaining internal security; and Fourth, to take more active
                        steps on the covert level to find and develop a moderate nucleus of moderate
                        middle class political leadership, since the long-range future lies with the
                        middle class, and we cannot risk truly remaining aloof and aligning
                        ourselves only with the Shah, the Army, and <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that these suggestions
                        were interesting but tricky, particularly the last item. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has survived, and this in itself has
                        been a success. Obviously the middle class must eventually become more
                        identified with the government, but the time scale is doubtful.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                        replied that the two latter points were long-range, but we could at least
                        start them now.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJW3">Bowling</persName> remarked that for years
                        our Mission has been under instruction to attempt to locate, for possible
                        build-up and support, realistic moderate middle class leadership, but it has
                        so far not been able to come up with anything.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                        said that he was contemplating something more direct and specific.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thurston asked if elements of the military could not serve as this type
                        of middle-class leadership.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Spain, quoting from the National Intelligence Estimate, said that there
                        is some potential, but not much, as compared with a country like Pakistan,
                        in the military for real political leadership.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Lardner said that he thought the group was overlooking some unpleasant
                        realities. He pointed out that the Government of Iran was sovereign, and
                        mentioned a previous U.S. Ambassador who had tried to pressure the Shah to
                        specific action and had immediately lost all his influence and
                        effectiveness. There is a limit as to how hard and fast we can push on these
                        things. We must also be more specific. How much can you achieve in a certain
                        period? On the matter of the budget, can you find the men you need in a
                        hurry? We may be ignoring details to a dangerous degree. We cannot continue
                        to talk in generalities. To come to a decision, we must have something
                        concrete to study. Perhaps it would be too risky politically, perhaps not,
                        but we can’t decide on the basis of generalities. Perhaps we on the Task
                        Force are deficient in not working up <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0312"/>more specific proposals for action. Everyone talks in
                        generalities but waits for someone else to come up with specific
                        proposals.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> said that we cannot wait
                        forever, and that our approach must be frankly experimental. In a time of
                        crisis one must take risks, and perhaps play by ear, never knowing exactly
                        what the result would be. We should explore low-confidence options in this
                        type of situation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Lardner said that, for example, we agree that improvement in the
                        judiciary would be desirable—the question remains how one goes about it. And
                        is it remotely achievable in time to affect the political crisis?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Polk<note n="11" xml:id="d105fn11">Of the Policy Planning Council.</note>
                        said that the important thing was comprehensiveness; even uncompleted
                        actions could have beneficial political results.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> said that in the Task Force
                        we established a general line of action. If the Embassy had come back with
                        an affirmative reply, we could have come up with specific plans. But this
                        Embassy response brings me to a halt. If the Country Team is incapable of
                        devising policy it is probably incapable of implementing policy. I’m for a
                        real action program, but much of both the genesis and execution of such a
                        program must come from the field.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that it is clear from
                        the Embassy response that our tentative Washington appraisal of the fiscal
                        problem was over-optimistic. The Prime Minister has a sense of the problem
                        but not a lively sense of it. We must act, when we act, through the existing
                        crisis, which is now expressed in fiscal and economic terms. If we ignore
                        this, we would be deviating from our own recommendations. In the nature of
                        our response to the immediate crisis must be the seeds of longer-term
                        progress which will result in <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>
                        coming out stronger, broader based, and with broader support from the Shah.
                        Our response to this immediate crisis must be such as to provide
                        alternatives to its repetition. The Embassy paper does not seem to me to be
                        do-nothing. The Ambassador is feeling his way into the situation. Our field
                        people have decisiveness and vigor of leadership. The field is now actively
                        engaged in re-evaluating and changing our economic aid pattern.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> said that Task Force could
                        be a useful tool for packaging an effective instrument to meet the crisis in
                        Iran. I see no signs that we are out of the framework of crisis action.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that the crisis is one
                        which has deep and fundamental roots.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bennett noted that the Central Bank was not playing the role that it
                        should in Iran, and that <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> had
                        fired a good chief of that Bank and put in a poor one. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> asked if we could continue to rely on
                            <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0313"/>the normal processes of
                        diplomacy as envisaged in the draft memorandum and in the Embassy’s
                        response, and if we should not move in strongly and immediately on such
                        questions as that of the head of the Central Bank.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> noted that our <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>-approved instructions were to move
                        “positively but discreetly”, and that the word “discreetly” had been
                        inserted after a thorough discussion. We should push actions at the
                        wholesale and not at the retail level.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> remarked that we had
                        assumed that <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> would play in the
                        direction of the National Front, and that he had not done so. We
                        misevaluated him; he is acting as a typical Persian Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> said that perhaps we must
                        choose between too much pressure and presence or none at all.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that we are expecting
                        further information on the nature and extent of the two upcoming
                        financial-economic problems, and that our response will be affected by the
                        final shape of this year’s foreign aid legislation. In about the next three
                        weeks we must all study ways in which we can respond to the present crisis
                        in such a way as to advance toward a solution of basic problems.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> suggested that an “issues”
                        paper be written and that the Task Force then break up into “action groups”,
                        in order to speed up the machinery.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that when we have firm
                        information on the fiscal and economic problems, we can devise the best
                        possible responses. Before closing the meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> directed that a short <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> memorandum be distributed (copy
                            attached).<note n="12" xml:id="d105fn12">Not printed.</note></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> indicated that another
                        meeting of the Task Force would be called within three weeks to consider
                        specific Iranian requirements for additional financial assistance, whenever
                        the necessary information should be available. He asked members of the Task
                        Force to consider in the meantime various alternatives as to the U.S.
                        response.</p>

                    <p>On September 9, 1961, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> in
                        a memorandum to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                        requested the President’s authority to raise the Consulate in Kuwait to
                        Embassy status and head it with a Charge d’Affaires ad interim, but to defer
                        designating an Ambassador. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        indicated that on September 5, the Kuwaiti Government, whose independent
                        status the United States recognized, had requested the establishment of
                        diplomatic relations. The Secretary noted that the newly-appointed British
                        Ambassador to Kuwait was scheduled to present his credentials on September
                        12, pursuant to an agreement between the United Kingdom and Kuwait reached
                        on August 22 to exchange Ambassadors. According to the Secretary, a number
                        of other countries, including several from the eastern part of the Arab
                        world, were expected to establish diplomatic relations with Kuwait in the
                        near future.</p>

                    <p>You have raised the question in regard to Mr. Johnson’s memorandum of August
                        17, 1961 (Tab A)<note n="1" xml:id="d107fn1">In this memorandum to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, August 17, Deputy Under
                            Secretary for Political Affairs Johnson pointed out that the principal
                            objection to inviting <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> at
                            this point to visit the United States during 1962 was the long lead
                            time, because the world situation or <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s behavior might change during the interim. A
                            handwritten notation by <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> on
                            this memorandum reads: “Agree. DR. But if he comes to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>?” (Ibid.) On August 31, Johnson replied
                            to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> that if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> attended the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> General Assembly session he should be
                            treated in a manner similar to that being given to other chiefs of state
                            and heads of government attending the session, that is, that he be
                            invited for a meeting with the President either in Washington or New
                            York. (Ibid., 786B.11/8–3161)</note> as to what should be done regarding
                        an invitation to President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> if
                        he should decide to come to the United Nations General Assembly this
                        fall.</p>
                    <p>While we have as yet no information on whether or not he will come to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, the President has made it clear
                        (National Security Action Memorandum No. 84, Tab B)<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2"><gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No. 84 is a
                            memorandum from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                            to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>, August 28, regarding
                            “Specific State Visits.” The first sentence of the memorandum that deals
                            with six different visits reads: “It seems to me that if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> comes to the General Assembly
                            that he should be invited to Washington to have lunch with me.”</note>
                        that he would want to see <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> here
                        in Washington. This, of course, coincides fully with our own view that the
                        President should meet with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> if
                        the latter were indeed to come to New York.</p>
                    <p>At the same time we believe such a meeting should not be considered a
                        substitute for a more formal and complete visit to this country by the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> President. We feel certain that
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> himself, in spite of his
                        brief stay in New York last fall, would like very much to enjoy the prestige
                        and opportunity for contact with American leaders which a longer visit would
                        permit. Practically every other world figure of comparable stature has been
                        invited at one time or another to be an official guest of the United States.
                        A visit would represent an appropriate evolution in the present relatively
                        favorable atmosphere of our relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>However, the matter of timing is important and, if properly handled, we
                        believe the prospect of the visit, as well as the visit itself, can obtain
                        for us some political advantage. The following method of handling a
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit is suggested: <list>

                            <item>When it becomes apparent that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is not coming to the General Assembly, we
                                should authorize Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> to make a general reference at an appropriate
                                time and in the course of some other discussion with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> President to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>’s hope that it may be

                    <p>We now confront what may be a two-pronged problem in Iran. In addition to the
                        longer-term adverse internal trend, there is now reason to believe that the
                        Soviets may seek to put pressure on Iran in connection with the Berlin

                            and other <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> powers had plans to
                            attack the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_PNM1">Pegov</persName>

                            urgent in the light of competing requirements for <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> and Berlin. How much could we really

                            reaction in event of a Soviet move will have a much greater deterrent

                        the following assessment of the situation in Syria.<note n="1" xml:id="d109fn1">Earlier on September 28, <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> had requested the Department of State Operations
                            Center to initiate a watch on the situation in Syria. (Memorandum from
                            Thurston (<gloss target="#t_SO1">S/O</gloss>) to Johnson (<gloss target="#t_G1">G</gloss>), September 28; ibid.)</note> Major units
                        of the Syrian armed forces have gone over to the rebels and have taken
                        control of military stations and important areas in the city of Damascus. In
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>’s view this places
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in an almost impossible
                        box. If he accepts what has happened in Syria, he will lose whatever status
                        he has achieved not only in the United Arab Republic but also as the leader
                        of the Arab world. On the other hand if he attempts to crush the rebellion
                        he will confront considerable military difficulties in doing so because of
                        the problems of distance and geography. Such an effort would be an admission
                        of the failures of his own policies to integrate Syria into the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Our first preference, if there is any kind
                        of strife or open conflict which develops between <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s troops and the armed forces in
                        Syria, would be to use our influence to limit such strife to civil war. We
                        would thus use our every effort to forestall active interference by third
                        parties. It is the Department’s conclusion from studying biographic
                        reference material on the coup leaders, that the leaders of this rebellion
                        are the same people as those who planned a coup a year ago. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] However, it
                        is the Department’s belief that King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> has been caught completely by surprise by the
                        present coup.<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">In telegram 28 from Amman,
                            received at 3:10 p.m. on September 28, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> reported that he had met with
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> at 3:30 p.m. Amman
                            time and found the King “thoroughly puzzled re what actually happening
                            Syria and, on basis latest radio reports, distinctly pessimistic re
                            success coup effort.” The King said he had decided not to move troops
                            into the northern part of Jordan, and if he decided to do so later, it
                            would be only for defensive purposes. King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> later telephoned <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> to say that, after hearing radio reports
                            indicating the coup had a better chance of success than he had thought,
                            he had decided to move some troops into the northern areas of Jordan.

                    <p>The question now is whether <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        will send troops into Syria and if so whether King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> will order Jordanian troops to come
                        to the assistance of the rebels. If so it seems quite possible that Israel
                        would move troops to the west bank of the Jordan river. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> pointed out that in general the
                        question of movement of troops now is one of pure <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0320"/>speculation and conjecture. However there
                        is a report that <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> has moved
                        some troops to the northern part of Jordan along the Syrian border. There is
                        also a report that Iraq has moved some forces toward the Syrian border
                        although they are sufficiently insignificant to have little effect on the

                    <p>It looks as if Nasr has burned his bridges and is determined to snuff out
                        revolt (this based on his unequivocal speech and intercepts of Amir talk,
                        not any actual movement reports yet).</p>
                    <p>In turn, Syrians have come out squarely repudiating <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and condemning Nasr exploitation.</p>
                    <p>The die seems cast. What do we do? State sees Nasr facing three tough
                        choices: (a) Give up; (b) compromise; (c) attack. State doubts latter but
                        I’m not so sure at all. State is sending out cables urging restraint and
                        non-intervention on Jordan, Turkey, Israel. State feels two sides should be
                        left to fight their own civil war, and that worst course would be to let it
                        become an international war. State feels any Syrian regime likely to be
                        unstable; while present crew may seem all right, who will ride in on their
                        coattails?</p>
                    <p>Again, I wonder. One alternative would be as follows: <list>

                                This to deter Nasr and reassure Syrians they not alone. But, no one
                                should move yet.</item>

                            <item>Above adds up to covert encouragement of new Syrian regime, on

                        </list></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Risks</hi>: If Nasr attacks Syria, and Jordan responds by
                        entering Syria, then Israelis might move to west bank of Jordan. This would
                        really put fat in fire.</p>
                    <p>Nasr’s capabilities, air and amphibious, seem limited if Syrians really
                        united around new crew. He would have to get beachhead or airhead in
                        Latakia-Aleppo area in north, and then move on Damascus. But if Syrians
                        divided and Nasr can pick up considerable support in Syria, his chances much
                        better.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he assumed the Department has received a report from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> of his interim, oral report to the
                        Palestine Conciliation Commission on September 26.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">Johnson reported to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> on his mission during a meeting at
                                <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> in New York on September 26.
                            The memorandum of conversation is in Department of State, Secretary’s
                            Memoranda of Conversation: Lot 65 D 330. Telegram 918 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, September 26, contained a summary of
                            Johnson’s interim report. (Ibid., Central Files, 825.84/9–2661) For
                            text, see Supplement, the compilation on the Arab-Israeli dispute.
                            Johnson submitted his final report to the General Assembly on November
                            24. (<gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> doc. A/4921/Add.1) See <ref target="#d140">Document 140</ref>.</note> On the surface, there has
                        been no change in public attitudes toward the refugee problem on the part of
                        host governments or Israel. The Arabs insist on repatriation as the sine qua
                        non of <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0325"/>any movement; the Israelis
                        insist there can be no repatriation without a change in basic Arab attitudes
                        toward Israel. In effect, each side says action depends on the other. At the
                        same time, there does appear a real possibility—“not a great possibility and
                        certainly not a probability”—that an individual working over a period of
                        several months, exploring, needling, making the parties aware of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and US concern, might achieve some progress.
                        Even so, a hard core of refugees will remain for at least 15 years,
                        requiring a continuation of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> or its
                        equivalent. A substitute in the form of contributions to governments to
                        enable them to care for the refugees is simply not practical.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> remarked that we are very
                        cautious about a hasty extension of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>’s mandate. It is the only leverage we have with the
                        Arabs.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he recognized this to be the case, although he cannot feel
                        our financial support of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> is a very
                        effective lever.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he had not, at first, been convinced of the desirability of
                        appointing an American as Special Representative of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>. His trip had convinced him that the job
                        must be undertaken by an American. Any movement toward solution must at some
                        point involve United States Government action or the parties will have no
                        faith in US willingness to follow through. Dr. Johnson said he believes his
                        own degree of association with the U.S. Government has perhaps been ideal.
                        It is known that he is acquainted with officers in the Department, yet his
                        connection is neither too close nor too visible. Dr. Johnson commented that
                        he believes the decision not to send a Department officer with him as escort
                        was entirely right. The presence of such an officer would have identified
                        him with this Government to an undesirable degree. As it was, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> staff had been a most helpful and well-informed
                        companion. The efficiency of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> administrative support had been
                        extremely gratifying. American diplomatic representatives had also been most
                        helpful and demonstrated a sympathetic understanding of the Special
                        Representative’s need to protect his identity as a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> emissary.</p>
                    <p>Responding to questions from those present, Dr. Johnson said it was clear to
                        him that the Arabs had not coordinated their positions in advance of his
                        arrival. Obviously, Lebanese suggestions that “resettlement” means
                        settlement only within the confines of former Palestine were motivated by
                        special domestic considerations. Jordan showed itself the country most
                        anxious to resolve the refugee problem on realistic terms. Perhaps the least
                        rewarding of the conversations which had taken place was that with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>. The talk with Prime Minister Ben-Gurion was the
                        “roughest”. So harsh did Ben-Gurion become that at one point Dr. Johnson
                        said he had considered <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0326"/>walking out,
                        if only for tactical purposes. Interestingly enough, Ben-Gurion had sent a
                        note of apology: apparently an unusual step for him.</p>
                    <p>Compensation of refugees, per se, constitutes no problem in the minds of
                        people of the area, either Israeli or Arab, since they are convinced the US
                        will foot the bill. It is equally clear that compensation is not enough. It
                        will help only a very small number of the refugees. Something will have to
                        be done for the others to make them feel that they are being “compensated”
                        and that they are receiving something with which to make a new start.</p>
                    <p>In terms of specifics, the “hunch” is that Israel might accept somewhere up
                        to 10,000 refugees per year for an initial period of 2 or 3 years provided
                        there were some movement on the Arab side as well. The refugees must be
                        given a meaningful choice, not just an alternative between remaining in the
                        camps or going to Israel. They must be given a chance to see what Israel has
                        become. When they have the opportunity of meaningful choice, their true
                        wishes must be ascertained, perhaps by something along the lines of the
                        Upper Silesia referendum. In the end, of course, any solution may be
                        rejected by the Arabs on political grounds, as was <persName>Eric
                            Johnston</persName>’s Jordan waters plan; “still, the effort is worth a
                        try”.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he had informed the Secretary, in confidence, that he
                        intends to frame his report to the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> as if
                        he were discontinuing his connection with the refugee problem. It would
                        genuinely be very difficult to disregard his responsibilities to the
                        Carnegie Endowment if, despite the nature of his report, there should be a
                        request that he continue to engage himself in the problem after the Assembly
                        session.</p>

                        force successfully against rebels he would have to move at once. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> did order invasion and pulled back
                        either as result of change of heart or inability of advance force gain
                        foothold. Having failed in attempted use of force <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> now appears to have accepted
                        separation of Syria and danger of military action may have passed.
                        Instructions to Amman in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> therefore
                        superseded by events. What course <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will follow in effort recover prestige not yet
                        evident. We hope that his non-aligned colleagues, without suggestions from
                        us, will persuade him in direction of restraint. Department desires pursue
                        normal relationships with him and with his government. We do not propose to
                        offer him counsel. Should new regime in Syria request our recognition and
                        should it meet tests for recognition we would wish accede to request within
                        reasonable time. However we desire avoid hasty action that would be held
                        against us in Cairo. Syrian regime may ease our problem by not seeking early

                                at the airfield of Dumayr, north of Damascus. The Egyptians are
                                reported to have 3,000–3,500 troops at their disposal, mostly at the

                                announced a formation of a Syrian cabinet, headed by Ma’mun Kuzbari

                                empowered the cabinet to govern by decree. Although the term Syria

                                not deterred Jordan from quickly extending recognition and Iran from

                                of the military junta which carried out the revolution remains
                                somewhat unclear, although some, such <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0329"/>as Colonel Haydar Kuzbari, a cousin of the newly
                                named Prime Minister is clearly rightist. Ma’mum Kuzbari, himself,
                                is something of a political enigma. He comes from a conservative
                                land-owning family which was affiliated with Col. Shishakli’s
                                so-called pro-Western regime of 1952–54. However, he also
                                participated in subsequent Syrian governments which were controlled
                                by anti-Western military juntas. Aside from the fact that he seems
                                capable of changing his political orientation at will, he is not a
                                particularly forceful or colorful figure nor are others in the
                                cabinet, though some seem considerably competent in their respective
                                fields. It seems clear that the members of the all-civilian cabinet
                                which has been named will be, as in the case of all Syrian civilian
                                politicians since 1949, the instrumentalities through which the
                                military junta will carry out its policy rather than the creators of
                                policy themselves. It will be difficult to determine, therefore,
                                what the future direction of the regime’s policy is likely to be
                                until more is known about the background and intentions of the
                                military officers who carried out the coup. It should be emphasized,
                                however, that the Syrians have traditionally been highly
                                individualistic and undisciplined people and that Syrian political
                                movements, no matter what the coloration or how well unified at the
                                inception, have always degenerated into squabbling factions and
                                rivalries, turning Syria itself into a dog-eat-dog political jungle,
                                which the communists are better equipped to deal with than we are.
                                We thus cannot take too much comfort from the relatively
                                conservative complexion of the new government. Additionally, for
                                reasons that are not yet entirely clear to us, the important post of
                                Minister of Interior in the new government, with its implied control
                                of the Internal Security apparatus, may have been given to a
                                pro-Communist (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_alDM1">Adnan
                                    Quwatli</persName>) and would seemingly afford an effective
                                point of penetration by the communists into the otherwise rightist
                                regime. There is another <persName corresp="#p_alDM1">Adnan
                                    Quwatli</persName> of less political prominence; therefore, we
                                are seeking clarification as to which one has been named Minister of
                                Interior and also an evaluation of him.</item>

                                internally, and it seems to us likely that, unless he can recoup

                                position in the area and at home will gradually deteriorate. He is
                                believed well enough entrenched in Egypt to survive for the time
                                being, but he has many enemies who will be sharpening their knives
                                in anticipation of the day when his crown falls. The danger is that
                                his increasing feeling of desperation may cause <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to lash out in some other
                                direction in an effort to restore his stature in the eyes of the
                                Arab people. He has turned defeat into victory in the past by such
                                methods and will be sorely tempted to try to do so again. Already
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is endeavoring to
                                blame <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0330"/>the events in Syria
                                on imperialist machinations. The speed with which the Jordanians and
                                the Iranians acted to recognize the new Syria revolutionary regime,
                                together with the rightist leanings of at least some of the cabinet,
                                tend to lend credence to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s charges. Further fuel would be added to
                                this fire, if, for example, such Syrian exiles as former President
                                Adib Shishakli, Mikhail Ilyan (Nationalist Party leader now in exile
                                in Turkey) and a number of other Syrians who were banished because
                                of their alleged pro-Westernism should return to the Syrian
                                political scene. One of the basic problems we faced is that of
                                discouraging any rash action on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s part and in endeavoring generally to
                                stabilize the Egyptian political position. It would thus seem
                                essential, even though recognizing that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s position is likely to decline, that we
                                continue our policy of reasonable cooperation with his regime in the
                                hope of influencing him toward moderation. With that thought in mind

                                We believe that most of the Arab governments will be inclined
                                viscerally to react in favor of the restoration of independent
                                Syria. Since most Arab leaders either overtly or privately have long
                                distrusted <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and feared
                                that the latter, in pursuit of his ambitions for Arab unity, would
                                attempt to undermine their positions, they are likely to shed very
                                few tears about the fact that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s prestige has been dealt an apparently vital
                                blow. Some of these governments may well have second thoughts,
                                however, about the prospects of having a shaky, unreliable Syria in
                                their midst and of possibly having to face up to the prospect of an
                                unstable Egypt in the near future. Additionally, although the
                                relations of the new Syrian regime with Saudi Arabia, Lebanon,
                                Jordan, and perhaps Turkey are apt to be good, its relations with
                                leftist-oriented Iraq are likely to be unharmonious at best.</item>

                    <p>Israel naturally also welcomes the blow to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s prestige, but it will have to face up to the
                        prospect that an independent Syria may again become activist in its

                    <p>The Department’s conclusion is that on the whole the defection of Syria from
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is not necessarily in the U.S. best
                        interests, and in the unlikely event that there is an opportunity for

                        we should welcome it. However, from one point of view, the complexion of the

                        abortive military effort to land in the north, recalled his forces when he
                        found that north Syrian garrisons had joined the revolt. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s speech indicates that he accepts
                        the inevitable.<note n="1" xml:id="d115fn1">In telegram 600, September 29,
                            the Embassy in Cairo reported that during a speech <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had said that he had started to
                            send 2,000 paratroopers as well as additional forces to quell the
                            rebellion in Syria but had ordered these forces to return when it became
                            apparent that the rebellion could not be crushed without bloodshed.

                    <p>He is now in a real bind, having suffered a major setback. Three alternatives
                        are open to him: (a) provoke a crisis with Israel so that he can rally all
                        the Arabs (including Syrians) around him; (b) attempt to undermine new
                        Syrian regime by combination of inducements, e.g. regional autonomy leading
                        up to a counter-coup; (c) do nothing and suffer further erosion of his
                        prestige. Some observers feel Nasser’s position in Egypt itself may now be
                        in peril, although I doubt this.</p>
                    <p>The new Syrian regime is conservative, anti-Egyptian, and probably reasonably
                        pro-Western outfit. Its natural ties will be to Jordan and Iraq. Not much
                        prospect of communist infiltration (Syrian <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>
                        is very weak), although new Interior Minister<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_al1">Adnan Quwatli</persName>.</note> had
                        some pro-communist associations. If past experience is any guide, however,
                        such Syrian regimes are notoriously unstable and subject to a succession of
                        coups.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Are the developments in Syria a net plus or minus from US
                            standpoint?</hi>
                        <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> seems to think that any Syrian regime
                        will be feeble and unstable; though the present crew seem moderately
                        pro-Western, much less savory characters could ride in on their coattails.
                        Moreover, the blow to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
                        prestige may drive him back into the arms of Moscow, or at any rate lead him
                        into high risk policies to recoup the blow to his prestige. Thus a new and
                        unpredictable element has been injected into the already volatile <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> situation.</p>
                    <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0333"/>
                    <p>On the other hand, the effects of this blow to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s position may not be adverse to our interests. His
                        role as a charismatic leader has been seriously circumscribed, which may
                        make him more tractable in the future. The net result may be to turn his
                        energies inward, toward the internal development of Egypt. The position of
                        the conservative, and relatively pro-Western Arab leaders has been enhanced.
                        The trend toward Arab unity at the expense of Israel may have been reversed,
                        at least temporarily.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">What should the US do?</hi> Officially nothing. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may yet seek to blame US or <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> for coup. We should avoid giving him any
                        pretext for doing so. This means evading early recognition of new
                        regime.</p>
                    <p>But if we wait too long we may lose initial advantage of being forthcoming
                        with new regime. Perhaps we could have it both ways by conveying discreet
                        assurances through third countries that we not hostile to new crew. Jordan
                        and Turkey are obvious bets.</p>
                    <p>Now is also the time to be extra nice to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. In his present cast-down mood he may be responsive
                        to any friendly overtures on our part. It might not be too obvious to come
                        out now with firm invite to US, or indicate approval in principle of <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loan application for $32 million to
                        construct grain storage facilities in Egypt. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>-Moscow relationship seemed to be cooling recently; we
                        don’t want to let this trend be reversed by default.</p>
                    <p>In sum, my recipe would be public posture of hands off, discreet, indirect
                        encouragement of new regime, and nice noises to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>

                    <p>181. Met with King at latter’s request afternoon 30th. King’s purpose was to
                        urge prompt USG recognition new Syrian regime. Stressed <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0334"/>that in his judgment regime now in definite
                        control situation and, on basis his knowledge of individuals involved,
                        believed new regime would be more pro-Western than predecessor. Believed
                        prompt recognition by USG and other states was final step needed insure
                        against irresponsible counter-move by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Then said wished me clearly understand that if
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> did make such a move
                        against new regime, Jordan would be with new regime and would go to their
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>While recognizing Department telegram 120<note n="1" xml:id="d116fn1"><ref target="#d113">Document 113</ref>.</note> superseded Department
                        telegram 116,<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2"><ref target="#d111">Document
                                111</ref>.</note> I did not think statement immediately preceding
                        sentence could be left without comment. I therefore spoke to King along
                        lines outlined paragraph 2 Embassy telegram 178.<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">The relevant portion of paragraph 2 of telegram 178 from Amman,
                            September 29, reads: “Therefore suggest as alternative that I see King
                            and point out USG’s serious concern that if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> makes military move regain Syria, every effort
                            should be made confine hostilities to two principal combatants. Would
                            also state that while understanding <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>’s natural sympathy insurgent group, USG believes any
                            intervention by any Syria’s neighbors could well trigger conflagration
                            whole Middle East and quite possibly World War III. Therefore, as
                            Jordan’s closest partner and as the nation carrying principal
                            responsibility for maintaining peace in world, USG requests opportunity
                            consult and fully exchange information on actual situation as it
                            developing before <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> plans intervene
                            Syria in any way.” (Department of State, Central Files,
                            786B.00/9–2961)</note></p>
                    <p>With regard to recognition I repeated point I had made previously to effect
                        that precipitous embrace of new regime by USG might not be helpful. Said I
                        furthermore suspected new regime itself not particularly anxious that USG be
                        in first wave of recognition. Also said that when <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> down, I did not think it either wise
                        or useful to give him gratuitous extra kick. Seemed to me precipitous USG
                        recognition could be construed as such.</p>
                    <p>King countered with argument that if USG really concerned re consequences of
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> military move and
                        Jordanian reaction, time to head this off was now, and means was by
                        extending prompt recognition which would deter <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> from making such a move. Once <hi rend="italic">Nasser</hi> moved, it would too late to contain situation.</p>
                    <p>I asked whether King thought <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        could in fact make countermove now unless there was some uprising within
                        Syria itself to whose support he could go. King said he thought this was
                        only basis, for present, on which <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> could launch countereffort. In response my further
                        question, King said he thought such an uprising was unlikely in view of firm
                        control new regime appears have of situation within Syria.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> King for moment sees Syrian developments as
                        mixed blessing and naturally is anxious have new regime supported as
                        promptly and fully as possible. While he understands reason why USG <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0335"/>not rushing into recognition, he
                        nevertheless feels somewhat let down by fact we not willing move as rapidly
                        as he in situation which he regards to be favorable to our interests as well
                        as his. (He also aware his immediate action re recognition being criticized
                        in number of quarters and obviously would like to be vindicated by having
                        others promptly follow his course.) Subtleties re handling <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> during this difficult period do not
                        interest him as he believes <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        probably up against situation about which he can do nothing. He also recalls
                        fairly prompt USG recognition of new Baghdad regime 1958 under circumstances
                        far less advantageous. In addition believe he is concerned re trouble Syrian
                        Communists may eventually cause for new regime and fearful this problem
                        could be accentuated if Soviets grant recognition prior to Western
                        powers.</p>
                    <p>My own view is Department is correct in not extending precipitous recognition
                        but on other hand believe recognition should not be denied unduly long
                        period. I concur in comments Damascus 129 to Department<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">In telegram 129 from Damascus, September 30, <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName> recommended recognition of the
                            new Syrian regime “reasonably soon.” (Ibid., 786B.00/9–3061)</note> and
                        would hope USG would be in fairly prominent place in second wave of
                        recognitions. In meantime Department may wish consider desirability now
                        extending privately to new regime indications USG support will be
                        forthcoming at appropriate time.</p>
                    <p>With regard to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>’s intention
                        come militarily to aid new regime if necessitated by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> countermove, I do not believe he
                        thinks this will in fact be necessary. Furthermore, King aware what USG
                        reaction would be to such move. Nevertheless, as long as there any
                        possibility of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> countermove,
                        danger of <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> intervention
                        remains. As Department aware, while <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> more deferential to USG views than those of any
                        other state, he is stubborn, full of self-confidence, and capable of taking
                        action against USG wishes if convinced he is right, particularly in
                        situations where he thinks own long-run survival at stake. This could be
                        such a situation, as King has long been convinced his regime cannot survive
                        indefinitely in Jordan unless there is break in link of hostility which
                        surrounds him. He clearly views Syrian developments as such a break and will
                        therefore feel under great compulsion come to aid of insurgents if this only
                        way their position can be maintained. Nevertheless, USG intervention at
                        highest level at crucial moment could have considerable effect on King and
                        remains best chance of deterring him.</p>
                    <p>In meantime, as King continues be in relaxed mood, believing his assistance
                        will not be necessary, recommend I continue handle situation within
                        framework outlined paragraph 2 Embassy telegram 178 with <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0336"/>Department ready to implement highest-level

                        necessary.</p>

                                country had recognized or even given any hint of recognition of new
                                regime whereas thus far only countries which have recognized are
                                closely identified with the West. If this trend continues,
                                suspicions of Western involvement in the Syrian coup, which are
                                already beginning to develop, will spread and prejudice US and
                                Western position in Middle East as a whole.</item>

                                outcome of a free referendum in 1958, which has not been canceled by
                                another referendum. Legally nothing has changed and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> continues to exist. Any hasty
                                recognition by the US would be contradictory to its policy of

                    <p>In reply Department official said he would report views Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> to his superiors. Whereas unable to
                        state what <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0338"/>the official USG
                        reaction would be, he felt obliged make certain comments in order that
                        Ambassador not be misled about US intentions. From a legal point of view the
                        US generally regarded de facto control of the country, acquiescence of the
                        people, and willingness to fulfill international obligations as its criteria
                        for recognizing a new regime. Acquiescence of the people did not necessarily
                        imply that there had to be a positive action, such as a referendum, but
                        merely that public as a whole accepted the existence of the new government
                        and was prepared to cooperate with it. As the Ambassador had pointed out,
                        there had been innumerable coups in Syria prior to union, some of which
                        might have been interpreted as in favor of Western interests and some of
                        which might have been interpreted as against Western interests, but in every
                        case the USG, as well as other governments of the world, had been obliged to
                        accept the realities of the situation and the necessity of establishing
                        relationships with the regimes which came to power, irrespective whether
                        that power had been achieved by constitutional processes. Department
                        official felt that, if the present de facto control of Syria by the new
                        regime could be maintained and its international obligations are respected,
                        there would be no insurmountable legal obstacle to extending
                        recognition.</p>
                    <p>Department official said he agreed, however, that this was a special
                        situation in that it was not a matter of a new regime having supplanted an
                        old regime, but of a new regime having been created side by side with the
                        previous regime. Therefore, it was necessary to take a broad view of the
                        problem and consider all of its aspects in relationship to the feelings of
                        both regimes. Department official said he felt he could assure the
                        Ambassador that the USG would take no hasty action but would consult fully
                        with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in respect to the recognition
                        question and, if and when recognition should ultimately, in our view, become
                        necessary, would ask for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s
                        sympathetic understanding. Department official said he hoped, however, that
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would not take the attitude that any
                        positive action vis-à-vis the new Syrian regime would ipso facto be taken as
                        hostility toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, since this was not
                        our intention. If the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should harden its
                        position to this extent, it might well create an impasse in future US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relationships which would be difficult to
                        surmount. Department official said that if it were <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> desire that USG not proceed unilaterally toward recognition
                        of new Syrian regime without at least informing <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, it was equally essential that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> not proceed to hasty unilateral actions tending to create
                        embarrassments. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> asked if
                        Department official had in mind such actions as the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> having severed relations with Jordan and Turkey, and
                        Department official replied affirmatively.</p>
                    <p>Department official said that he had been impressed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>’s statement that USG should carefully
                        observe what the <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0339"/>other Arabs were
                        doing on the question of recognition. It seemed to him that this is an Arab
                        problem in which the voice of the Arabs ought to be heard. If a majority of
                        the Arab states should decide upon recognition of the new Syrian regime, it
                        would be very difficult for the USG to justify delaying much longer in
                        taking similar action.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> at first agreed with this point
                        of view but later reversed himself and said that he felt the USG should be
                        more concerned with Soviet policy and the advantages the Soviet Union could
                        derive from delaying recognition. Department official replied that actions
                        of the Soviets were of course an important consideration which would be
                        taken into account by USG in making its decision. However, he did not feel
                        that USG policy could necessarily be governed by Soviet actions. Evidence
                        thus far received indicated new Syrian regime wanted friendly relations with
                        all countries including US. Persons included in that regime were not
                        “Chinese Communists” on whom we could turn our backs indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>Department official re-emphasized that any gestures we might make toward new
                        Syrian regime did not imply antagonism toward <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, that we continue desire friendly relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and that this desire sincere and
                        heartfelt.</p>

                        from new Syrian regime he had withdrawn most of Jordanian troops from border
                        area. Also said leaders new regime had informed him their conviction ability
                        handle any <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> military counter
                        effort without Jordanian or other outside help. King emphasized however that
                        if this should prove not be case, Jordan, Iraq and probably Turkey would
                        send troops to aid of regime. Went on state his conviction <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> under present circumstances did not
                        have capability making significant military counter-move against Syria.

                        Syria, had reported situation completely under control and that emissary had
                        been told if he had any doubts this score, he free go any part of Syria to
                        see for self. King also mentioned had just learned curfew completely lifted.
                        Also said had received word from Cairo that sabotage teams would be
                        parachuted into both Syria and Jordan. He was taking necessary internal
                        security precautions this regard.</p>
                    <p>King then renewed strong urgings that USG promptly recognize new regime,
                        using arguments previously reported and particularly stressing (despite
                        earlier indication negligible chances <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> military intervention) that USG recognition would
                        break log-jam holding back other recognitions which in turn would
                        collectively constitute definitive deterrent against <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> counter-move. Indicated moreover his
                        puzzlement re USG delay, believing regime now clearly met normal criteria
                        for recognition. Added new argument to effect he had always understood USG
                        supported principle of self determination, and new independent Syrian regime
                        clearly had support Syrian people.</p>

                    <p>I spoke of my gratification re southward movement Jordanian troops and
                        reiterated USG concern ramifications which would result if Jordan and/or
                        neighboring states moved troops across Syrian border. Also welcomed his view
                        there little likeli<persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName>

                    <p>Re recognition, said I had reported his views in full to USG and knew that
                        these along with other factors were receiving full consideration. Said
                        matter under careful study and USG presently canvassing situation. Noted
                        that current log-jam, to which he had referred, due in part at least to
                        failure of other Arab states to take lead in extending recognition and
                        should not be attributed to USG.</p>

                        not move militarily against Syria, Embassy concurs efforts work through this

                        would hope that recognition be accorded as rapidly as other factors

                        prevented this attack, he will be even less disposed than I now think he

                    </list>
                    <p>Under the aegis of the Task Force on Iran, State and Defense have reviewed
                        political and military contingency planning on possible United States
                        actions to deter Soviet military action against Iran, as well as to meet
                        other possible forms of Soviet pressure direct or indirect. The current
                        status of military contingency plans is discussed in the attachment to this
                        memorandum.</p>
                    <p>In reviewing possible and desirable United States courses of action in the
                        event of heightened Soviet pressures against Iran, it was found that the
                        United States was inhibited in both the military and the political spheres.
                        It has been assumed that Soviet military attack on Iran means general war.
                        There are therefore no plans for United States response to overt Soviet
                        action on less than a general war level. Politically, deterrent actions have
                        been circumscribed by the absence of a clear policy determination on several
                        issues, including whether or not the United States would be willing to risk
                        general war in order to defend Iran against Soviet military attack. If the
                        United States is not, it must be determined whether the United States is
                        willing to engage its prestige in a pretense that we are willing to go to
                        general war, in the knowledge that if our bluff were to be called it might
                        have disastrous results.</p>
                    <p>In an effort to cope with this situation, an informal joint State-Defense
                        Working Group has been urgently preparing a study of those political and
                        military deterrent actions which can be taken under present policies, and a
                        parallel list of those actions which might prove feasible and desirable in
                        the event of certain policy decisions being reached. It is anticipated that
                        this study will be put in final form following the publication on October 5
                        of a Special National Intelligence Estimate on the <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0345"/>Soviet threat to Iran.<note n="1" xml:id="d121fn1"><gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 11–12–61, “The

                                    Soviet Union and the United States in Iran have been reviewed as
                                    a matter of urgency. They consist of general war plans designed
                                    to support indigenous forces and contingency plans covering
                                    situations of a local nature, but not involving Soviet forces.
                                    These plans are based upon former United States policy outlined

                        <item>The recent elections in Israel did not produce any significant change
                            in the political situation. While the socialist Mapai party, <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0348"/>dominated by <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>, lost a few seats in the
                            parliament, it will remain the key political element over the next few
                            years. We foresee no change in the pattern of its forming coalitions
                            with lesser parties to govern the country. Nor do we foresee any
                            significant diminution of Ben Gurion’s power so long as he remains
                            active. His death would precipitate a contest for power in the Mapai
                            party, but we believe the main lines of Israeli domestic and foreign
                            policy would remain essentially unchanged. (Paras. 9–13)</item>

                        <item>Israel’s economy continues to grow at an impressive rate, but its
                            substantial adverse trade balance will continue to keep Israel heavily
                            dependent on private and governmental aid from abroad. The sharp
                            diminution of West Germany’s reparations and restitution payments over
                            the next few years will probably cause some cutback in investment and
                            development, in spite of Israeli efforts to increase the contributions
                            of world Jewry and to attract foreign industrial investment. (Paras.
                            15–17)</item>

                        <item>There has been no improvement in Arab-Israeli relations. Sporadic
                            border incidents are likely. Israel’s plans to divert substantial
                            amounts of Jordan waters to the Negev and the Israeli nuclear program
                            will continue to cause much apprehension among Arab leaders, and could
                            lead to forceful action. If the breakup of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> following the 28 September revolution in Syria does not
                            lead to turmoil on Israel’s borders, we foresee no significant immediate
                            impact on Israel. We believe, however, that Israel will be able to
                            maintain its military superiority over its Arab neighbors—a superiority
                            which the Arabs recognize and which inhibits deliberate attack on
                            Israel. Moreover, reluctance to provoke great power reactions inhibits
                            Israel’s undertaking preventive war. Primarily for these reasons, we
                            consider the chances of a third round of major hostilities to be less
                            than even. (Paras. 27, 33–35)</item>

                        <item>Israel’s foreign policy will remain based principally on its need for
                            strong support from the West, particularly the US and France. With two

                            Israel will endeavor to keep its relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at least correct. It will attempt to
                            preserve good relations with non-Arab Middle Eastern countries, e.g.,
                            Turkey and Iran. Israel will pursue an active program of aid to certain
                            African and Asian countries and will seek US cooperation in this field.

                    <p>The new government in Syria has requested the recognition of the United
                        States. We are confident that it meets the standard requirements for
                        recognition; it is in firm control of the country, has widespread popular
                        support, and has announced its intention to fulfill Syria’s international
                            obligations.<note n="1" xml:id="d124fn1">These criteria were listed in a
                            memorandum from Legal Adviser <persName corresp="#p_CAJ1">Chayes</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>,

                            the compilation on Syria.</note> Although the United Arab Republic has
                        requested that recognition by the United States be delayed, there have been
                        indications in the past two days of increasing flexibility on the part of
                        the United Arab Republic. In a speech on October 5, President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> declared that he had instructed the
                        representative of the United Arab Republic at the United Nations not to
                        oppose Syrian membership in the United Nations<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">A

                            October 6, discussed the various aspects of the problem of Syrian
                            membership in the United Nations. (Department of State, Central Files,

                        that he would not oppose Syrian acceptance by the Arab League, but the
                        United Arab Republic would not recognize Syria until “a free Syrian will”
                        had expressed itself. The way to recognition of Syria by Arab states and
                        others may, therefore, have been opened. We have informed the United Arab
                        Republic that we desire to consult with it prior to granting recognition to
                        Syria, and we would wish to do so in the relatively near future.</p>
                    <p>While we believe that in deference to the desirability of preserving an
                        acceptable state of relations with the United Arab Republic, we should not
                        hasten under present circumstances to recognize Syria, we desire stand-by
                        authorization to proceed with recognition (a) should the Soviet Union modify
                        its cautious posture and extend recognition, or (b) whenever other Arab
                        states have recognized, or (c) whenever the Department finds that it is in
                        the interest of the United States to grant recognition and that it can be
                        done without serious strain on our relations with the United Arab
                        Republic.</p>

                    <p>Therefore, we recommend (1) that you grant stand-by authority for the
                        extension of de jure recognition to the Government of Syria, (2) that you
                        authorize the Department to establish an Embassy at Damascus concurrently
                        with the extension of de jure recognition, and (3) that you authorize the

                            to <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_JJE1">Joseph
                                Johnson</persName> was very encouraged by recent conversations with
                            Takla and <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> in New York and
                            planned to meet on October 9 with Israeli Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>. He would then meet again with

                            report for the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>. The telegram also
                            reported that Johnson said that his most urgent and important request
                            was for the United States to agree to a 2-year extension of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>. (Ibid.)</note> Dept gratified by
                        success which has attended Dr. Johnson’s efforts thus far. While realizing
                        that much can be attributed to initial courtesies, Johnson seems have
                        developed valuable rapport with Arabs and Israelis. He also appears to have
                        instilled a consciousness of seriousness and sincerity of <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> (and USG) endeavors.</p>
                    <p>In view of foregoing, Dept favors long-term continuation of <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss> efforts and hopes current <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> will so resolve. Progress which <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss> will be able to make will, however, depend
                        considerably upon <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss>’s freedom of
                        maneuverability. To preserve this freedom, and in fact to preserve
                        possibility that <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> will endorse
                        continuation of <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss>, it is in Dept’s view
                        important to avoid to extent possible providing Arabs or Israelis with
                        specific issues or specific proposals which could become bones of
                        contention, particularly during forthcoming <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss><gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> debate. Thus Dept
                        would prefer no published substantive report by Johnson. However, we
                        understand he feels committed. If he makes public report, we would hope it
                        would be relatively unspecific and as non-controversial as possible. He
                        might if he felt impelled to do so make a more detailed and substantive
                        confidential report, preferably orally, only for use of <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>. We do not wish to open Pandora’s box. It
                        is Dept’s impression that as of present Arabs and to lesser extent Israelis
                        are considering forthcoming <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> debate
                        with some equanimity and with an expressed desire not to stir up troubles
                        unnecessarily. If this disposition could prevail through the forthcoming
                            <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> debate we would be more than
                        pleased.</p>
                    <p>As long as present Arab moderation continues Dept believes threats re
                        possible cessation of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> should be
                        avoided. At same time, it is too early categorically to commit USG to <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>’s extension. In any case, before this
                        done full approval must be obtained from various interested parties within
                        USG.</p>
                    <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0352"/>
                    <p>Tentatively, Dept believes best tactic would be for Johnson tell Arabs that
                        he would be prepared press USG to agree appropriate extension of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> if they would support longer range
                        mandate for a special representative, would sincerely cooperate with him,
                        and would not press controversial issues in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> which could prejudice atmosphere conducive to constructive
                        progress on this question.</p>
                    <p>As regards <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> report scheduled be released
                        fifteenth, we are satisfied that present language should go long way deny
                        either party basis for contentious statements. We will wish consider
                        carefully whether a further <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> report will
                        be desirable just prior opening of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> debate.
                        Any final judgment on this matter must be deferred pending completion
                        present phase Johnson mission and reaction of parties. Assuming that
                        Johnson’s findings are received reasonably and favorably by parties
                        concerned, there may be advantage to following up this report with second
                            <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> report which would contain
                        recommendations for continuation of Special Representative on long-term
                        basis, and call for continuation of international assistance to Arab
                        refugees (without specifying <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>If we can proceed on this basis, we may perhaps be able this year to achieve
                        reasonably non-contentious and non-recriminatory debate with action moving
                        along above lines. This will depend, of course on whether all-out campaign
                        for such concepts as custodianship can be avoided.</p>
                    <p>Re Syrian factor, Dept understands <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> being
                        informed by appropriate <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> authorities of

                    <p rend="center">REPORT BY CHAIRMAN OF IRAN TASK FORCE</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>’s memorandum of August 7,
                            1961,<note n="1" xml:id="d127fn1"><ref target="#d94">Document
                            94</ref>.</note> reflected the President’s concern as to whether the
                        United States was doing all that it could or should in pursuit of the
                        policies laid down in the original Task Force report on Iran. Since receipt
                        of this memorandum, the Task Force has met a number of times. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> has returned for
                        consultation to participate actively in the Task Force’s work. There has
                        been a full and free exchange of opinions and analyses, not only of the
                        present situation but of possible courses of action.</p>
                    <p>It has emerged from the Task Force’s deliberations that there is no
                        significant divergence of opinion as regards United States objectives
                        vis-à-vis Iran. To prevent Soviet domination of Iran must be our immediate
                        and overriding objective. This requires the continuance in power of a
                        pro-Western regime, for the ultimate alternative is a weak neutralist
                        government which could not withstand Soviet pressures and maintain Iran’s
                        independence. Maintenance of the pro-Western regime has been achieved and is
                        not immediately endangered. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has succeeded in overcoming a near-crisis situation
                        and thus continuing Iran’s pro-Western policy. He has, however, been unable
                        fully to pursue his program of vigorous reform measures designed to lead to
                        a more permanent resolution of the political weaknesses of Iran.</p>
                    <p>He has had to take into account the necessity of retaining the confidence and
                        support of his somewhat reluctant monarch. He has been faced with political
                        pressures from the fanatical Mosadeqist opposition, <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0354"/>and the sniping of ambitious and
                        discontented conservative leaders. The implementation of the economic
                        stabilization program has intensified these difficulties by infringing the
                        interests of various special groups. The basic inadequacy of the
                        administrative tools available to him, which can be improved only slowly,
                        have further limited his freedom to action.</p>
                    <p>The first Task Force report stressed that the United States must actively and
                        vigorously, albeit discreetly, press for political, economic, social and
                        institutional reforms in Iran which will provide the indispensable
                        foundation for true and lasting political-economic development. It is
                        generally agreed that the Third Development Plan scheduled to begin in
                        September 1962 must be the primary vehicle to initiate the fundamental
                        political and economic progress needed in Iran. It is equally agreed that
                        the intervening period will be one of critical importance in laying the
                        necessary foundation for the implementation of this third Five-Year
                        Plan.</p>
                    <p>I have found a consensus within the Task Force that additional United States
                        resources will be required to enable the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> Government, or a like-minded successor, to surmount
                        the political and economic difficulties which it will face between now and
                        the initiation of the Third Development Plan.</p>
                    <p>We have agreed with the Agency for International Development on the general
                        levels of United States financial resources required for this purpose, and
                        action is going forward to make them available through appropriate means and
                        at the necessary times. The Ambassador, with the advice and assistance of
                        the Country Team, has worked out a Military Assistance Plan for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962–67 which he believes to be militarily
                        and economically consonant with basic United States interests and through
                        which we can hope to maintain our influence with the Shah and hence be in a
                        position to attain our objectives. The plan is currently being studied by
                        State and Defense in the context of a review of our over-all <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> policies.</p>
                    <p>A great deal of the Task Force’s efforts have been devoted to discussing
                        alternative means to ensure that the introduction of these resources best
                        accomplishes United States objectives, not only our immediate aim of
                        maintaining a pro-Western government but our longer-term goal of laying the
                        political and economic groundwork for the successful implementation of the
                        Third Plan. Basically, two schools of thought emerge: One advocates an
                        openly activist role for the United States; this would involve the tying of
                        United States aid to formal and perhaps public commitments on the part of
                        Iran to perform certain actions designed to correct specific deficiencies
                        and weaknesses in the political and economic fabric of Iranian society. The
                        countervailing view holds that the same objectives, given the complexities
                        and fragility of <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0355"/>Iranian society,
                        would be better accomplished by the private and discreet exercise of United
                        States influence and pressure.</p>
                    <p>As Chairman of the Task Force, I have carefully considered all of the
                        arguments presented by the members of the Task Force, and have carefully
                        weighed the potential implications of each against the realities of the
                        Iranian scene as presented by our Ambassador, the other members of the
                        Country Team, and our own Iranian experts. I have consulted closely with the
                        Secretary and my other colleagues in the Department. I have concluded that
                        the risks to the maintenance of a pro-Western regime in Iran posed by
                        insisting upon formal and overt United States conditions for the giving of
                        aid are greater than we could prudently accept. Either approach is fully
                        consistent, in my opinion, with the philosophy of the new aid program.
                        However, the first, by seeking the long-term objective through too direct an
                        approach, runs too great a risk of upsetting the delicate balance which
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has succeeded in
                        creating and maintaining. Given the framework within which the Iranian
                        Government must operate, counter-pressures would be produced which could
                        easily result in the loss of Iran to the West.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, the correct course for the United States to follow under the
                        present circumstance is to move towards its goals by combining vigorous but
                        discreet political and economic advice with the minimum economic assistance
                        essential to enable the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>
                        Government, or a like-minded successor, to survive and to move forward. The
                        judicious and vigorous application of encouragement, support and pressure
                        through multiple channels can be effectively directed to influencing those
                        areas where progress is realizable at any given moment rather than relying
                        on formal assurances or promises which may prove to be empty. In this
                        context, United States or international assistance will be utilized to
                        stimulate self-help moves on the part of the Iranian regime. Influence
                        exerted in this way can be far more effective than open threats that we will
                        cut off aid to Iran.</p>
                    <p>As Iran moves towards the implementation of the Third Plan, we will wish to
                        draw in multilateral influences which can be brought to bear through an
                        international consortium of lenders. We hope by then there will have been
                        enough progress to permit the more overt exercise of outside influence,
                        perhaps to the point of establishing some public contract arrangement with
                        the Iranian Government in return for the major international assistance
                        which will then become necessary. In the interim, our influence in the
                        direction of helping Iran move from the present delicate stage to a position
                        of readiness to enter upon the Third Plan can best be brought to bear
                        quietly. Now we must act unilaterally and discreetly.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> fully concurs in
                        this course of action, and believes that the additional instruments of
                        pressure and influence which <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0356"/>we
                        have worked out with the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, and which he
                        has requested in the field of Military Assistance, will be the best means to
                        make further progress toward our objectives.</p>
                    <p>Set forth as Annex “A” are the basic elements of the action program which the
                        Ambassador has pursued in consequence of the Iran Task Force recommendations
                        of May, and which he proposes to intensify during the period between now and
                        the end of the Second Development Plan. In doing so he proposes specifically
                        to address himself to the goals set forth in Annex “B”.</p>

                            of the continual encouragement, support, and pressure exerted by the
                            United States Government through all its various instruments:</p>

                        <p>The new government has survived all the early challenges to its power. It
                            has halted a twenty-year trend to disunification and is actively laying
                            the groundwork for meaningful political, social, and economic advance.
                            The guidance, support and pressure of the United States have been an
                            indispensable element in these developments. What remains is to reverse
                            long-term divisive trends and lay the foundations for a new political
                            synthesis.</p>

                        <p>Although the Shah continues to exercise direct control over defense, he
                            has come to share with the Prime Minister control over foreign <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0357"/>affairs, the internal security
                            functions of the Ministry of Interior and the secret police, and in all
                            other fields of policy-making and administration has gone along with the
                            Prime Minister. The Prime Minister exercises more freedom of action than
                            has any of his predecessors since Mosadeq, although he has frequently
                            admitted to the Ambassador that the Shah sometimes acquiesces only with
                            reluctance. Largely as a result of United States representations the
                            Shah has withdrawn publicly and privately from the politically exposed
                            position which he has occupied for many years.</p>

                        <p>When <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> took office, he was

                            Shah’s support, as well as the opposition of the military and urban mob.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> is not a charismatic
                            leader, but he has not only gained the support of the Shah, but has
                            averted the danger of a military coup and has earned the cautious
                            cooperation of the conservative and landowning elites. Although the
                            Prime Minister is under continuous attack from some ambitious
                            conservative leaders and some prominent business men who have been hurt

                            to enlist the support, or at least the toleration, of this embittered
                            opposition grouping. However, the Mosadeqist leadership is still
                            unwilling to settle for anything less than a controlling voice in the

                            Provision of this assistance is required if current progress affecting

                    <p>In telegram 318 from Tehran, October 17, 1961, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> warned that recent developments in
                        Iran might seriously affect Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s tenure in office. <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> called the Department’s urgent attention to despatch
                        186 sent via pouch on October 16, which contained his analysis and
                        recommendations as to what the United States should do. (Department of
                        State, Central Files, 611.88/10–1861)</p>
                    <p>On October 21, Acting Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Armin
                            Meyer</persName> forwarded despatch 186 to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and called the Secretary’s attention,
                        in particular, to the summary and Recommendations A, B, and C. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>’ proposal was in line with current
                        policy guidance toward Iran as set forth in the May 19 Task Force
                        Recommendations. He added: “<persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>
                        has consistently displayed caution with respect to United States actions
                        which might involve the United States too deeply <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0364"/>in domestic Iranian political problems. His analysis and
                        recommendations undoubtedly reflect a serious situation requiring early
                        United States action.” <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> also
                        submitted the text of draft instructions to Tehran, which the Secretary
                        approved. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> Files: Lot 72 D

                    <p>The summary of despatch 186 from Tehran reads as follows:</p>
                    <p>“Summary. This despatch summarizes key developments of approximately the past
                        two weeks on the subject of the relationship of the Shah and the Prime
                        Minister, sets forth the Embassy’s analysis, and makes recommendations as to
                        the course of action that should be followed. Briefly, we believe that the
                        Shah may be succumbing to the temptation to undermine the Prime Minister’s
                        position, that the Shah is seriously considering the assumption of personal
                        rule, and that the Shah may be about to give in to pressures for elections
                        in the near future, not because he wants elections per se but because he
                        considers this a means of curbing or even of getting rid of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>. I recommend that I be authorized to
                        advise the Shah against assuming personal rule at this time, to speak to him
                        in a negative sense with respect to holding national elections in the near
                        future, and to make clear that we desire the present government to continue
                        to be given the opportunity to carry out its program.”</p>
                    <p>Sections I–IV of the despatch describe recent developments and contain the
                        Embassy’s assessment of the situation. Section V contains the following
                        recommendations: <list>
                            <item><p>“A. That I be authorized to tell the Shah that our Government
                                    does not believe that he should assume personal control at the
                                    present time.</p>
                                <p>“It seems to me that this is the easiest of the courses to knock
                                    down because it can be done by a combination of objective
                                    analysis and flattery: to wit: because the Shah is the bedrock
                                    of the Iranian political system, he and the institution he
                                    represents should not be risked except in extremis; the present
                                    situation is not desperate enough by any means to warrant such a
                                    risk. If he assumes power in a less-than-emergency situation, he
                                    would have no place to retreat if his rule was not crowned by
                                    marked and continuing success from then on.</p></item>
                            <item><p>“B. I recommend that I also be authorized to speak to the Shah
                                    in a negative sense with respect to his idea of holding
                                    elections in the near future.</p>
                                <p>“There are several dangers in such a recommendation. First, the
                                    United States might well be publicly labeled as opposing
                                    elections. I suggest that the answer to this is that we are
                                    already credited with being against elections and it would not
                                    be immeasurably more difficult to deny the actuality than the
                                    rumor.</p>
                                <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0365"/>
                                <p>“Secondly, the Shah can always seem to accept our advice and then
                                    make our recommended course impossible of achievement. This is
                                    the most difficult criticism of our recommendation to answer
                                    because it is the most likely outcome. We nevertheless believe
                                    that an attempt should be made to turn him from all three
                                    courses and concurrently encourage him to support Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>. We cannot see that the
                                    interests of the United States would be any worse off than if we
                                    did not try. Nor do we believe, whatever the probabilities, that
                                    success is inevitably impossible.</p>
                                <p>“I recognize that even if our advice were sincerely followed by
                                    the Shah there would still be some continuous clamor for
                                    elections, the most difficult source to handle being the
                                    University. The answer to that comes in two parts. First, we
                                    believe that the University will continue to be a trouble spot
                                    regardless of the probable courses of any government. Secondly,
                                    if the objective political situation in Iran—as opposed to the
                                    situation which those who want to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> pretend to see—worsens
                                    because of increased pressure for elections or the failure of
                                    Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s program, we
                                    will have to reassess the situation and perhaps come to a quite
                                    different conclusion than we have reached today.</p>
                                <p>“Finally, it is our assessment that the Shah’s preferred course
                                    is clearly the assumption of personal rule and that he probably
                                    has no great desire to hold elections in the near future except
                                    as a means of getting rid of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>.</p>
                                <p>“My idea would be simply to tell the Shah that in our opinion a
                                    time of economic crisis is not the most propitious for holding
                                    elections and we believe it would be preferable to delay any
                                    announcement of elections for a period of perhaps at least six
                                    months. At the same time, as a means both of driving home this
                                    point and probing the Shah’s thoughts on the matter, it might be
                                    a good idea to confront him with a number of questions, some of
                                    which are set forth below: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                                development to hold elections without any government

                                paper, and much of the Task Force discussion of it, raises a serious
                                question whether we are in fact receding from the Task Force
                                conclusion of last May that “we, ourselves, can no longer afford to
                                rely so heavily on the Shah.” The position taken at that time, which
                                was considered by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and the
                                President in adopting the new policy recommended by the Task Force,
                                was based on a realistic appraisal of the Shah’s inability or
                                unwillingness to provide the leadership required for progress which
                                is crucial to U.S. interests in Iran. At best he will only
                                acquiesce—under pressure—to rapid and fundamental reform; and his
                                strategy for maintaining his power and the base on which the power
                                rests will undoubtedly remain in conflict with objectives that the
                                U.S. must seek in Iran over time.</p>
                            <p>It has been recognized by all members of the Task Force, throughout
                                our work beginning in May, that the Shah is still the center of
                                power in the present Iranian regime. It was also understood that the
                                Shah did not especially like <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> and that U.S. efforts to bolster <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> and his program would have to
                                swim upstream insofar as the Shah was concerned. It was with this
                                understanding of the problem that the Task Force, and the U.S.
                                Government under the new policy, determined that the outlook in Iran
                                required us to “take vigorous action to assist [<persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>]<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">Brackets in the source text.</note> in stabilizing the
                                situation and then in building a new political synthesis through a
                                broad program of moderate reform,” and that “In so doing, we must
                                discreetly help to protect him against … the Shah’s traditional
                                predilection for undercutting prime ministers as potential threats
                                to his own power.”</p>

                            <p>Much has happened since May. The U.S. has taken some vigorous actions
                                which have helped <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> to
                                stabilize the situation. Whether the downward trend has actually
                                been permanently halted or reversed is another question which I
                                would like to comment on below. But if we adopt the apparently
                                prevailing assumption that there has in fact been a reversal, the
                                thrust of our policy toward Iran would require that we then proceed
                                with “vigorous action … in building a new political synthesis.”</p>
                            <p>It is clear to me from all discussions that everyone concerned is
                                dedicated to accomplishing this task at the earliest time and by all
                                means that appear feasible. It is clearly a difficult task. But I am
                                basically concerned that the overriding emphasis of the October 9
                                paper on the obstacles to action arising from attitudes of the Shah,
                                tend seriously to shift our focus from the recently-declared need
                                for action in achieving significant progress through the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> program, back to the previous
                                preoccupation with the dangers of displeasing the Shah.</p>
                            <p>Long experience in dealing with the Shah and his historical manner of
                                directing the dialogue toward every type of real and imagined
                                problem except the lack of development and reform, suggests that we
                                are unlikely to achieve our objectives in Iran unless our own
                                internal policy considerations stay focused sharply on the question
                                of what we can and must do rather than what we cannot do. We must
                                still look, of course, to our Ambassador and his country team for
                                judicious adaptation of the necessary actions to the situation as it
                                evolves on the ground in Iran. No one can fail to recognize that
                                their job is an especially difficult and delicate one in Iran, which
                                cannot always proceed with the same degree of clarity and directness
                                which should characterize the basic policy guidance from which they
                                work. Recognizing the severe difficulties we face in dealing with
                                the problems in Iran, the thrust of our own policy statements should
                                focus heavily on our striving to make what is possible correspond to
                                what is desired, rather than vice versa.</p>
                            <p>It is in this light that I am uneasy about the heavy emphasis of the
                                current paper on the primacy of the Shah in determining our approach
                                to Iran.</p></item>

                                October 9 report does not clearly characterize for the President our

                                be consistent with the requirements in Iran and with the thrust of
                                our existing policy.</p>
                            <p>Given the apparent need of the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government for assistance (financial and
                                political) in overcoming some of its critical weaknesses, we have
                                asserted that it would be desirable to place the next tranche of
                                economic assistance on a basis which will give the maximum push to
                                the fundamental economic actions which must be pursued soon. This
                                would mean bringing other sources of aid into the picture at this
                                stage and placing some open and explicit conditions of an economic
                                nature on whatever assistance we provide. It means also a stepped-up
                                effort in the political field. We urge, in essence, a package action
                                program which would require vigorous U.S. leadership to succeed.</p>

                            <p>The revision of the Stabilization Program is viewed as a prime
                                vehicle for economic aspects of this “package” approach.</p>
                            <p>The proposal to dramatize this approach—to make it overt—and to make
                                it multi-national was intended to underscore the seriousness which
                                we wanted the Iranian Government and other countries to attach to
                                U.S. expressions of interest and to the assistance rendered. We are
                                concerned about the possibility of falling back to a “bail-out”
                                approach, which might buy a few more months of time in a manner
                                which sacrifices a crucial opportunity for pushing ahead on the
                                fundamental problems.</p>
                            <p>The high-level team visit to Iran is not necessarily indispensable to
                                this new approach. While it was our impression from the information
                                at our disposal that such a course might be desirable, there is no
                                real reason why the necessary actions cannot be taken under the
                                leadership of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> and the country team. The important thing, in
                                our view, is to develop and vigorously pursue a program of joint
                                action in which the efforts of the U.S., Iran and other parties
                                concerned come to grips with the basic problems underlying the
                                recurring crises.</p>
                            <p>As was mentioned in the last Task Force meeting, the country team is
                                clearly expected to initiate proposals for policy action and to
                                evaluate the risks of alternative actions. The decision, however, as
                                to the degree of risk to take is a function of evaluation and
                                determination by the Chairman of the Task Force, and ultimately by
                                the President. Therefore, an action program which calls for imposing
                                conditions on the Iranian Government as a requisite to additional
                                financial assistance, and the promulgation and urging of a political
                                action program involving some uncertainties as to efficacy and risks
                                vis-à-vis the Shah, could appropriately be recommended by the Task
                                Force on the basis of a real need for such action.</p></item>

                    <p>The characterization of the action program underway, while it reflects
                        progress, indicates that this action will be continued on the basis of
                        “persistent discreet political and economic advice with the minimum economic
                        assistance essential to enable the Government to survive and move
                        forward.”</p>
                    <p>No one can argue convincingly against using discretion in the manner in which
                        we seek to achieve our basic objectives in Iran—it is like arguing against
                        sin. On the other hand, discretion need not rule out placing some difficult
                        but legitimate conditions on continued economic assistance; and it need not
                        rule out coupling these actions with explicit advice and overt assistance in
                        the political area to the extent this is acceptable to the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> regime, which must still be
                        characterized as the “best, even the last, opportunity for a moderate
                        evolution in Iran.”</p>

                    <p>The action strategy proposed should not merely consist, as pages 11 and 12 of
                        the draft report indicate, of a middle ground between hypothetical extreme
                        situations. The extremes to be avoided, as they are described on these
                        pages, appear to me to be “straw men.” (This applies particularly to the
                        last full paragraph, which so substantially over-characterizes what has been
                        proposed that it loses most of its value as a part of the analysis.)</p>
                    <p>Therefore, with regard to the Immediate Requirements part of the paper, I
                        would suggest a substitution of this with the economic and political action
                        programs in our memorandum of October 3, deleting, however, the proposal to
                        send a special <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> team to Iran and
                        substituting therefor a proposal that the country team, in concert with an
                            <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> team and in coordination with the
                            <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, institute the program delineated
                        under that paragraph.</p>
                    <p>I would further revise the recommendations to provide $40 millon of grant and
                        loan aid to include a proposal to the effect that the Iranian Government be
                        urged to explore (with U.S Government support) the possibility of further
                        interim assistance from the West Germans, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and the oil companies preparatory to the inauguration of
                        the Third Plan.</p>
                    <p>The above comments would call for a significant recasting of the draft report
                        (which I hope will occur whether or not you accept all of the specific
                        proposals we have set forth or embrace the reorientation to country team
                        activities that we propose).</p>

                    <p>On October 19, 1961, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and
                        South Asian Affairs <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> sent
                        through Chairman of the Policy Planning Council <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> a memorandum to Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> recommending that the Secretary seek
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>’s approval for
                        extending an invitation to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to
                        visit the United States the following spring. A memorandum from Francis E.

                        that Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Johnson remained
                        opposed to extending an invitation to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> at that time, preferring instead to issue an <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0372"/>invitation early in 1962 for a
                        visit shortly thereafter. (Department of State, Central Files,
                        786B.11/10–1961)</p>
                    <p>On October 22, Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Hubert H.
                            Humphrey</persName>, who was visiting Cairo, held an extended
                        conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>,
                        whom the Senator had first met during a trip to Egypt in 1957 (see <ref target="frus1955-57v17#pg_587"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>,

                        the conversation, which among other points, noted <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s anti-Communist views, his interest
                        in better relations with the West, his disinterest in restoring previous
                        ties with Syria, and his concern over Egypt’s development needs.

                        trip to the Middle East is in Department of State, Central File

                    <p>On October 26, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> sent <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>’s memorandum to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> with a note indicating
                        that it was “worth your reading.” <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> also advised: “The time has come for us to make a
                        gesture toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> designed to
                        reassure him that we are not really sitting back and chortling over his
                        discomfiture in Syria. Despite this, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> remains the most powerful leader in the Arab world.
                        Moreover, disillusionment over Syria may lead him to turn inward and try to
                        make a success of ‘revolution in one country’, while relaxing his efforts to
                        achieve tight political union among the Arabs. Both developments would be to
                        our interest.” <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> also recommended
                        that the best gesture would be to invite <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to visit the United States the following spring. He
                        noted that the Department of State was on the verge of making such a
                        recommendation. (Kennedy Library, National Security Files, Country Series,
                        United Arab Republic, 7/61–10/61)</p>
                    <p>A memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_SRC4">Strong</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>, dated October 31, that discusses
                        developments during <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>’s absence
                        from the Department of State indicates: “We pulled back our memo on the
                        invitation to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, but Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> has recommended an
                        immediate invitation. Alex Johnson still thinks an invitation for a visit
                        next March should not be made until January.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_NEANE1">NEA/NE</gloss> Files: Lot 63 D 33, Chron. Asst

                    <p>You will recall the controversy last fall resulting from the discovery that
                        Israel, aided by France, had been secretly engaged in the construction of a
                        nuclear power reactor at Dimona. You will recall, also, that our concern led
                        us to arrange, through diplomatic channels, for an unpublicized visit to the
                        new reactor by two eminent American scientists. They reported that, for the
                        time being at least, the reactor seemed designed for the peaceful purposes
                        the Israelis claimed for it. [<hi rend="italic">4–1/2 lines of source text
                            not declassified</hi>] While placing reliance in the assurances of the
                        Israel Government as to its present peaceful intentions regarding use of the
                        Dimona reactor, we cannot ignore this possibility.</p>
                    <p>Should Israel contemplate weapons manufacture, one inhibiting factor, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                        would be its lack of weapons designs. Such designs, if available, might be
                        obtained from the French. However, there are indications of some cooling in
                        French-Israel relations. Indicative of this are unevaluated reports that
                        French technicians have been instructed by their government to suspend work
                        on the Dimona reactor. It is conceivable, therefore, that the Israelis might
                        seek to acquire weapons designs from sources in this country.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of well-considered policy, we remain opposed to acquisition by
                        Israel of a nuclear weapons capability. To this end, and as a follow-up to
                        the secret visit made by our own scientists, we are considering means of
                        arranging an open visit to Dimona by “neutral” scientists. Prime Minister
                        Ben-Gurion assured President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                        he agreed to this when the two met in May.<note n="1" xml:id="d132fn1">See

                            indicated his intention to inform the Prime Minister at the appropriate
                            time that the United States wished to obtain written assurances of his
                            intention to take the requisite steps to balance next year’s budget and
                            to set the stage for the successful launching of the Third Plan.

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> stated that he felt the Task
                        Force favors aid for Iran, and that it concurs in the necessity of rallying
                        to the support of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> politically
                        and economically. However, it might be better for the Ambassador to rely
                        primarily on economic assistance in influencing the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, since the prospects for military assistance along the
                        lines recommended by the Ambassador appear unfavorable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> also felt that in view of recent
                        political developments in Iran and in view of the Ambassador’s message
                        suggesting that written assurances be obtained at the time <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 aid is announced, the Ambassador might
                        now have modified views as to the nature of the Task Force report to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>, and that the Ambassador
                        should be given an opportunity to present such views.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> stated that <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> would convey these points to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> in separate telegrams or
                        other communications.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> asked if the $5 million
                        mentioned in the original Task Force report is still being held in reserve,
                        and Mr. Miklos replied that the $5 million is a part of the present aid
                        tranche.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> also predicted that it
                        would be extremely difficult if not impossible for <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> to find suitable areas in the Second Plan for the extension
                        of project loans, and suggested that perhaps some other and more practical
                        basis for development lending in Iran could be found.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Miklos agreed, but said that a general program loan was most difficult,
                        and that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> wants to try once more to find
                        acceptable projects.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> remarked that this telegram
                        should be cleared through the 15/50 procedure. Mr. Miklos said that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> did not believe it required such procedure,
                        but that he would mention it once again to <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> officials.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> suggested that the telegram
                        be amended to provide that as a condition precedent to the extension of the
                        contemplated assist-ance, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> be
                        required to work out a revised stabilization program with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> within two months.</p>
                    <p>After some discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName>
                        promised to make reference to the stabilization program in an amendment to
                        the text of the telegram conveying information as to our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 assistance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Hansen</persName> asked whether our
                        supporting assistance was tied to the Iranian military budget. Mr. Miklos
                        replied that it was in response to the Prime Minister’s request, which was
                        non-military.</p>

                    <p>341. <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> and I had more then two
                        and a half hours with Shah Saturday evening.<note n="1" xml:id="d134fn1">October 28.</note> He began by speaking in broad terms of need for all
                        members free world strengthen themselves to meet growing power and
                        belligerency Soviet Union. He emphasized key strategic position Iran and
                        Middle East oil whose continued supply necessary for Western Europe
                        industrial strength. Iran, having no population pressure and good human and
                        natural resources, could be made showcase SE Asia and brought rapidly to
                        internal strength. Shah then expounded on his preoccupations as set forth in
                        Embassy despatch no. 186 and enclosures,<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d129">Document 129</ref>.</note> saying that although
                        he was concerned with internal problem, he felt that close alliance with US
                        and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> justified consultation and an appeal
                        for understanding and assistance.</p>
                    <p>Shah then said what is needed for rapid progress is a plan and a dedicated
                        “team” to carry it out in such manner as to give hope and promise to Iranian
                        people. He reminded us he is the repository of stability and power, that any
                        government must have his support to succeed and that being obliged thus to
                        “give of his person” own government’s program should be consistent with his
                        plan for the improvement of the nation and should be carried out in
                        effective and loyal manner to accomplish his goals for the country. He
                        described his plan in general terms which contained only one innovation: to
                        use surplus army conscripts in construction projects such as irrigation,
                        schools, etc. It included decentralization of government with emphasis on
                        municipal councils, reforms in the administration of justice
                        (anti-corruption) laying great stress on independence of judiciary,
                        improvements in education, civil service and administration, land reform,
                        strong measures for tax collection, etc. He had not reduced this plan to
                        writing.</p>
                    <p>Shah then raised question of elections saying that free elections in the
                        Western sense out of question at present time in Iran with no responsible
                        political parties and no real parliamentary tradition. The results would be
                        irresponsible Majlis composed of self-seeking politicians, many dangerously
                        inclined toward neutralism. The choice then lay between elections of the
                        traditional Iranian Govt or rule by decree without Parliament for two or
                        three years while reforms went forward. He asked <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0377"/>our advice as to which of these choices would be the wiser
                        and what our governments’ attitude would be toward them. <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> and I both replied that in our
                        judgment, which we believed would be shared by our governments, government
                        without a Parliament for two or three years would be preferable to another
                        rigged election provided that economic and social reforms were energetically
                        pursued during the two or three year period.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> and I both came down hard on
                        dangers of personal rule and advantages to sovereign of having responsible
                        Prime Minister and Cabinet. <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName>
                        spoke emphatically on ministerial responsibility and Shah’s need for
                        protection from public criticism of necessary but unpalatable acts of
                        government. I seconded these remarks by citing fact that much of criticism
                        of present Prime Minister came from those who disliked his austere economic
                        measures and that <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> served Shah
                        well as a lightning rod. He was obviously impressed by my statement that he
                        should keep himself and his final power in reserve in order to meet any real
                        emergency that might result from subversive acts directed from the
                        outside.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question the Shah said that his idea of a “team” was in fact
                        a Prime Minister and Cabinet with his full backing. He then spoke of
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> saying that he would not
                        object to latter continuing as Prime Minister provided he was willing to
                        develop an integrated Cabinet and to work wholeheartedly with Shah in
                        carrying out latter’s program of reform and progress. He said that he did
                        not dislike <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> although latter was
                        weak in some respects, talked too much and acted too little. On the other
                        hand, he praised Prime Minister’s attitude on foreign affairs particularly
                        as he was completely opposed to neutralism. He felt also that <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> had made progress in economic-fiscal
                        front but that in these matters he had high competency. I reminded Shah of
                        extremely bad economic and financial situation which <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> had found on coming to power, that he
                        had taken stringent measures to stop runaway inflation, etc. I said that to
                        achieve economic and fiscal order water had to be squeezed out of the
                        economy, a balanced and consolidated budget established looking toward a
                        firm base for the financing of the Third Plan which should hold real promise
                        for Iran. I said that in my recent visit to Washington I had recommended
                        economic aid which was geared to <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s program in an effort to assist in achieving this
                        good base for the Third Plan. The Shah agreed that <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s economic and fiscal program was
                        necessary and would not be abandoned. He expressed concern as to continuing
                        economic stagnation during the winter with resulting unemployment and
                        possibility of unrest. <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName>
                        replied that in his view the situation was not as dark as Shah described and
                        suggested that those persons who had talked to him in this regard had
                        emphasized unfavorable factors for their own purposes. The Shah agreed.</p>
                    <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0378"/>
                    <p>I asked whether or not Shah had spoken to <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> in the sense he was then speaking to us and he replied
                        that he had done so only in general terms. That he had told the Prime
                        Minister that he would have to make a decision during this week as to
                        whether elections would be held now or whether there would be government
                        without Parliament for two or three years. He then wondered whether he
                        should speak to <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> in specific
                        terms concerning his plans now or wait and make his decision in the spring
                        after the next budget is completed. This was not a direct request for our
                        opinion and we offered none.</p>
                    <p>The audience concluded with the Shah stating that he presumed we would like
                        to consult our governments concerning their attitude with respect to
                        elections. We replied that we naturally wished to report our conversation
                        and would do so at once. The Shah said that if the governments had any other
                        views or observations than those which we had expressed, he would like to
                        have them before the end of this Persian week which will be November second.
                        I should therefore like to have a confirmation of the opinion I expressed
                        concerning elections by November first. I should not convey an official
                        approval of USG to the Shah but would simply telephone the Minister of Court
                        saying that I had no need to see Shah again on matter we had discussed
                        Saturday. <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> is making the same
                        recommendation. <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> and I agree
                        that we made all of the points included in our instructions either directly
                        or indirectly and we believe with substantial effect.</p>
                    <p>I had another conversation alone of about one and a half hours Sunday morning
                        with the Shah resulting from my original request for an audience. This
                        consisted of general discussions of the visit to France, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s attitude, Soviet acts, etc.,
                        which was followed by another strong plea for additional military material
                        to modernize Iran’s armed forces. I told the Shah that this was under
                        consideration in Washington, that the appropriations available for military
                        assistance were less than expected, that the demands were very great and
                        that work was in progress to determine the wisest allocation in view of the
                        many requirements around the world. I said that I did not expect to have an
                        indication of the results of these allocations before last week
                        November.</p>
                    <p>The Shah returned to our conversation of Saturday saying that he had been
                        thinking it over and that he probably would speak to <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> in the specific terms concerning his
                        plans within the week. He added that he did not see why <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> would not accept. He then said, half
                        to himself, that of course there are others who could do the job and looked
                        up quickly adding “but not a military man.” In response to my question, the
                        Shah said that if he decided now to have a government without Parliament for
                        a two or three year period, he would make a public statement to this effect
                        and that he was confident that he could stop agitation for early
                        elections.</p>
                    <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0379"/>
                    <p>The Shah is a complicated man, full of changing moods and uncertainties. I am
                        unable to predict what course he will follow but I am convinced that what
                            <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> and I had to say to him
                        will make him approach his decision in a more thoughtful and careful manner
                        than that he has exhibited in recent conversations.</p>

                            Israel be allowed to review the report before it was made public.
                            (Ibid.)</note> She went on, however, to stress that one thing Israel
                        could never accept was inclusion of “free <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0381"/>choice” in whatever recommendations might be made. Realized
                        US would not deliberately support any program clearly inimical to Israel’s
                        security, but “good intentions not always enough”.</p>
                    <p>I stated assumption that even if phrase “free choice” omitted report could be
                        expected at least to contain more generalized reference to pertinent <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions and expressed hope such reference
                        would not evoke negative Israeli reaction. Without giving clear-cut answer,
                        Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> stressed objection to
                        sifting out and concentrating on individual passages in resolutions.

                    <p>As the first Departmental visitor to the reconstructed Syrian Arab Republic I
                        was given the full treatment in Damascus. Some symbolic meaning was read
                        into the choice of the State Guest House which for three years was <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s home in Damascus and which had
                        never before been used to entertain foreigners, as the locale for the
                        luncheon given me by the Minister of Finance.</p>
                    <p>From the US point of view, the new Syrian regime, if it demonstrates staying
                        power, represents a promising opportunity. The Ministers call this the first
                        liberal revolution among the Arabs. They point out rapidly that it is not
                        reactionary, but for the first time offers Arabs an opportunity for vigorous
                        social advance under non-totalitarian conditions. Themselves surprised at
                        their speedy success, the leaders of the <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0382"/>coup are now trying to create a government that Syria will
                        accept as better than <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
                        combination of bright promises and a tight rein. They want to relax some of
                        his stringent measures without awakening fears among workers and farmers
                        that gains made under <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will now
                        be lost. This is what involves them in such measures as denationalization or
                        compensation for businesses that are to remain nationalized, 25% shares of
                        corporate profits to be distributed among workers and (hopefully) currency
                        convertibility.</p>
                    <p>I got no indication of current relations between the army and the civilian
                        Cabinet. The Cabinet itself looks technically strong and politically weak.
                        It needs to resist efforts by land owners and businessmen to pull it far to
                        the right. Kuzbari is aware of this and a long-range threat from the left.
                        The Cabinet meets practically daily, from late afternoon or early evening
                        frequently until midnight. So far it has been moving in generally sound
                        directions. I think we should approve its decision to keep Communists in
                        jail, to widen its political base through early non-partisan elections, and
                        to restore financial order out of the remains of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s policies.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister told me in almost so many words that he wants Syria to be
                        neutral—on our side. He cannot immediately strike down the major economic
                        and military relations with Bloc countries developed during the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> period. He knows the Bloc is eager to
                        maintain these relations, and that the US cannot easily replace the Bloc as
                        a market for Syrian cotton or as a provider of military equipment.
                        Nevertheless, Kuzbari claims to want closer political and economic relations
                        with the US than Syria has permitted in the past. His Ministers have already
                        asked us about an aid agreement, which of course Syria never previously was
                        willing to negotiate.</p>
                    <p>Partly as a protection against efforts by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to infiltrate and subvert his regime, Kuzbari wants
                        good relations with his Arab neighbors. Arab nationalism must still be a
                        strong talking point. Having broken [with] the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> the coup leaders talk vigorously of a wider Arab unity
                        based on “brother<persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> and equality
                        rather than on domination.” Kuzbari believes Syria can develop good
                        relations with several Arab countries, especially since <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s predominance has been reduced. I
                        came away feeling that the survival and stability of the Kuzbari regime (or
                        something like it) are strongly in the U.S. interest. It exists and its
                        failure will doubtless be followed by something more extreme. It professes
                        public and political values that are closer than either <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s or <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>’s to our general posture. If it succeeds, it could
                        provide a rallying point for liberal—as contrasted to extreme—Arab politics.
                        With Jordan, Lebanon and possibly even Iraq and Kuwait it might form a
                        fraternal grouping resulting in greater security and peace in the Fertile
                        Crescent <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0383"/>area. At best, a
                        successful Kuzbari regime could shift the balance in the Near East a little
                        more in our direction.</p>
                    <p>If it is to survive effectively, the Kuzbari regime probably needs various
                        kinds of political and economic support. Straight aid is not the only
                        answer. I believe we should go to work intensively to discover ways in which
                        we can help the Kuzbari effort and can encourage others to help as well.
                        This will involve several difficult questions. More than any other, I am
                        concerned about what we should do when—as it soon must—the Syrian armed
                        forces begin to feel the pinch of shortages of spare parts. Considering all
                        of our other commitments and involvements in the region, we need to
                        calculate carefully how far and in what ways we and our friends can get
                        involved with the Syrian military. Would one way be for us to help the
                        regime meet its public safety needs by a broadly conceived program of
                        assistance to police and gendarmerie forces? The main thing is for us to be
                        ready with a program that is sufficiently flexible in political and economic
                        support, so that we can respond quickly when the plea for assistance
                            comes.<note n="1" xml:id="d137fn1">In a status report covering several

                            must simultaneously reinsure ourselves with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, lest embracing Kuzbari drive <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> back toward the Bloc. From a
                            strategic point of view, is it more important to cozy up to five-million
                            volatile Syrians or to make our peace with the largest and most
                            influential country of the Arab world? Hopefully we can avoid this
                            dilemma, but let’s not ignore it.” (Kennedy Library, National Security

                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Governments would approach any decision made by Shah with
                                sympathy.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Expressed belief that any criticism of delay in holding elections
                                would to some extent be offset by progress seen to be made in
                                intervening period with development and reform.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>I added suggestion that any public announcement that elections would be
                        postponed for a long period might endanger stability. Shah agreed with this
                        statement. He then thanked us and said that reply of our governments was an
                        intelligent one; that he wanted it clearly understood that he had no
                        intention to seek sharing of responsibility; that he felt our association
                        sufficiently close for friendly consultation but that decision to be taken
                        would be his alone.</p>
                    <p>Shah then repeated arguments against hold “free” elections now, adding a new
                        point in that the so-called opposition and those clamoring for immediate
                        elections were almost without exception in favor of neutralism or
                        nonalignment. He felt that in some cases this represented sincere conviction
                        but that in most it would be a rallying cry in an electoral campaign.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> and I believe this
                        assessment to be substantially correct.</p>
                    <p>The Shah then returned to his concept of a “plan and a team” making it very
                        clear that his idea of a team was a Prime Minister and a Cabinet with whom
                        he would work out the details of a broad plan of development and reform and
                        that Ministers would be enjoined to select dedicated and honest staffs to
                        assist them. He said that in the absence of a Parliament his was the only
                        real constitutional power and that it would be necessary to promulgate laws
                        by decree which would be subject to eventual ratification by a Majlis. It
                        would be his intent that when circumstances made it possible to hold
                        elections, a principal issue would be ratification of acts of the
                        interregnum. In response to questioning he agreed that new laws would be
                        prepared by the government and would then be promulgated by the sovereign.
                        At this point <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> and I again
                        pointed out the dangers of the Shah’s involvement in day to day operations
                        of the government and his need for a Prime Minister and Cabinet who would
                        assume responsibility vis-à-vis public. The Shah <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0385"/>agreed to this and said that it would require a Prime
                        Minister with courage to take this responsibility. We pointed out that the
                        present Prime Minister had demonstrated his willingness and capacity to fill
                        this role and the Shah agreed.</p>
                    <p>The Shah stated that failure to hold elections was, in fact, a violation of
                        the constitution and that the present situation is illegal and that as long
                        as this was so, a vigorous effort should be made to get on with reforms and
                        improve the condition of the country, without the handicap of an interfering
                        and unproductive Majlis. He felt that a change should be made without delay
                        as it was dangerous to allow the present situation to continue thru the
                        winter. I emphasized the need for the present economic and fiscal program to
                        go forward looking toward a balanced and consolidated budget and the
                        establishment of a good economic base for the Third Plan. The Shah agreed
                        and said that more should be done to produce an imaginative and popular
                        program which would improve public morale and help get through the next few
                        difficult months. He thought action should be taken without delay to begin a
                        real campaign for improvement with a reconstituted government or a new one.
                        He did not feel that the intervening months between now and the spring
                        should be wasted. The Shah expressed the view that once it was publicly
                        known that he was personally engaged in broad and genuine reform, agitation
                        for elections would dampen down. In response to questions he appeared
                        confident that he could persuade many of those now clamoring for elections
                        to be silent.</p>
                    <p>At this point Shah reverted to his concept of a plan and, although it was in
                        similar general terms as he expressed a week ago, he added a few scattered
                        details. One element would be the creation of commissions in every ministry
                        to purge its administration of undesirable elements, saying that even if no
                        dishonesty could be proved, these elements could be dismissed with payment
                        of two or three years salary in lieu of pension rights. This would require a
                        new law and extra temporary expense but it would eventually prove to be an
                        economy. He said that the land reform law would have to be amended and that
                        provision should be made that workers remaining on the properties of
                        landlords must have their status converted from peasants to that of
                        agricultural employees with rights equivalent to industrial workers. The
                        educatorial system should be revamped and fees should be charged at the
                        university level for those able to pay while scholarships should be provided
                        for promising students with no means. The situation had to be changed which
                        permits a student to receive a diploma that he has not earned and which he
                        thinks entitles him to a high government position.</p>
                    <p>The Shah said that he would talk with the Prime Minister about his intentions
                        but did not indicate whether or not he would offer Doctor <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> the opportunity to remain in office.
                        He did not mention any other <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0386"/>persons whom he might be considering as Prime Minister. I asked him how
                        soon he expected to take action and he replied within the week.</p>
                    <p>I think it is clear that the Shah has definitely made up his mind to postpone
                        elections indefinitely and to sponsor a new program of reform which he hopes
                        would be imaginative and dynamic with an appeal to the public. I am unable
                        to tell whether or not he will keep Doctor <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> in office provided that the latter is willing, or
                        whether he expects to appoint an entirely new government. <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> agrees with this assessment and we
                        both are inclined to think that the chances of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> continuing are somewhat less than we thought a week
                        ago. We both feel that we have made all of the points contained in our
                        instructions and that the Shah understands very clearly our views and those
                        of our governments. I feel that I have used every means in Doctor Amini’s
                        favor that I could appropriately employ without going so far as to tell the
                        Shah whom he should have as Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> has been very helpful in this and has gone even
                        farther in support of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> and his
                        program than I had expected he would.<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">In a

                            Staff summarized developments concerning the Shah’s desire to assume
                            personal rule, noted that this would jeopardize U.S. efforts to achieve
                            a more effective pro-Western power base, and asked whether there should
                            be one strong, final appeal to the Shah against this course. (Kennedy

                            the reform program, at least until well into 1962. There will be no
                            elections before the Iranian new year in March and probability they will
                            be postponed further.” (Department of State, Central Files,

                        the Department is apprehensive about the effect on the Arab refugee problem
                        which may result from Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>’s address to the Israel Knesset and the Knesset’s
                        resolution rejecting the principle of Arab repatriation.<note n="1" xml:id="d139fn1">On November 6, the Israeli Knesset adopted a
                            resolution, introduced by the Mapai Party, that approved a position on
                            the Palestinian refugee question, presented initially on October 11 by
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> and
                            reiterated by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> on November 6. The position, which was to serve as
                            guidance for the Israeli Delegation to the United Nations, stipulated
                            that the Palestinian refugees should not be returned to Israeli

                        consideration of the problem are still guided by the President’s
                        conversation with Prime Minister Ben-Gurion.<note n="3" xml:id="d139fn3">See
                                <ref target="#d57">Document 57</ref>.</note> Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>’s speech and the resolution are a
                        different tack. The resolution does not make Dr. Johnson’s labors easier and
                        may be a complicating factor in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss>
                        Despite these developments, however, the Department still assumes that the
                        United States can rely on the Prime Minister’s remarks to the President as a
                        foundation from which to plan further steps. He recalled that a number of
                        conversations between Ambassador <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0388"/><persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> and State Department
                        officials, including Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>, had encouraged the Department to believe the
                        Prime Minister’s position as outlined to the President remains
                        unchanged.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> commented that the
                        Knesset is a sovereign body whose actions he could only report, not presume
                        to analyze. However, two years ago he had made clear that Israel could not
                        be expected to hold its tongue, in the interests of avoiding controversy, if
                        the Arabs insisted on making political capital of the issues. The
                        President’s message to Arab heads of state and its reference to the refugees
                        had been a prelude to a series of hostile statements by Arab politicians. He
                        mentioned, among others, a September pronouncement by President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that if the Arab refugees returned
                        Israel would cease to exist. He cited as particularly noxious statements by
                        Jordan Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TB3">Talhouni</persName>, by
                        King Saud addressing a group of pilgrims to Mecca, and by Emile Ghoury. In
                        his view nothing in Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>’s
                        address to the Knesset conflicts with the viewpoints she expressed to Dr.
                        Johnson either in Jerusalem or New York. He drew attention to her
                        reiteration of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>’s willingness to
                        discuss compensation outside the framework of a general settlement and her
                        statement that the problem is not the question of the return of “not a
                        single refugee” but of resettlement.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said his Government
                        is deeply concerned with the apparent evolution in the status of the
                        Palestine Arab delegation, which seems to be uniting diverse elements that
                        the Arab states are prepared to sponsor as one group for the Political
                        Committee debate. He emphasized that last year a somewhat smaller group had
                        been presented as “a” Palestine refugee delegation; this year’s version is
                        described as “The” Palestine Arab delegation. He implied that Israel fears
                        the United States is according the group more recognition than in previous
                        years. If this trend is encouraged, he declared, he sees little chance for a
                        quiet debate in a minor key, which he understands is a United States
                        aspiration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said he shares Israel’s
                        fears that prospects of a quiet discussion are diminishing, observing he is
                        not certain he knows either Arab or Israel intentions. The Knesset
                        resolution and the Ambassador’s own remarks suggest a hardening of the
                        Israel position. Moreover, both the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> and
                        its Special Representative see evidence that Israel is less flexible than
                        earlier hoped. He recalled Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>’s often repeated desire for eschewing a “numbers
                        game” approach to the question of Arab repatriation, commenting he thinks
                        Israel’s categorical rejection of the concept of return is a “numbers game”
                        of a different variety.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said study of Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>’s speech convinces him that
                        it was no more than a summation of her public position as expressed <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0389"/>in the past. He cautioned against
                        reading too much into the Prime Minister’s remarks to the President. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> would recall the Prime
                        Minister expressed a great deal of skepticism about the steps proposed by
                        the United States, but had added if the United States felt obliged to go
                        ahead Israel would be as receptive as possible.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_SA12">Shukairy</persName>’s<note n="4" xml:id="d139fn4"><persName corresp="#p_SA12">Ahmad Shukairy</persName>, Saudi
                            Arabian Representative to the United Nations.</note> inscription as
                        first speaker in the debate is not a hopeful augury for moderate
                        consideration of the problem. He reported that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> is arriving in New York on November 19,
                        hoping that the debate will have been completed in its major aspects by the
                        first week of December, inasmuch as she goes to Tanganyika for its
                        Independence Day on December 9. He concluded by saying that he hopes to see
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> again at an early time to
                        discuss other elements of the problem, including the status of the
                        Palestinian “delegates”; and Israel’s belief that a positive resolution
                        might be the best way to counter undesirable Arab proposals. He referred to
                        the African suggestion of a resolution calling for direct confrontation of
                        the principals.</p>

                    <p>On November 15, 1961, in New York, <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>
                        Special Representative <persName corresp="#p_JJE1">Joseph Johnson</persName>
                        submitted his draft report for comment to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Delegations of Israel and the concerned Arab states. The
                        first two sections of the draft report dealt with Johnson’s terms of
                        reference and described conversations held during his September visit to the
                        Middle East and subsequently in New York. A third section entitled “findings
                        and conclusions” indicated that the mission had been limited to the
                        exploration of possibilities for progress on the refugee problem; noted that
                        despite appearances of intransigence and bellicosity, statesmen on both
                        sides wanted peace and expressed a willingness, with much reservation and
                        skepticism, to consider a step-by-step process for progress; and concluded
                        that although there was no prospect for an early resolution of the
                        Palestinian refugee question, careful consideration should be given to the
                        appointment of a Special Representative to serve until the autumn of 1962 to
                        determine whether progress could be made through a step-by-step approach.

                        (Department of State, Central Files, 325.84/11–2061)</p>
                    <p>On November 20 and 21, Johnson met with a committee composed of
                        representatives from the United Arab Republic, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan to
                        receive their comments on his draft report. The Arab comments were highly
                        unfavorable, particularly in regard to the historical section, which the
                        Arabs claimed had a strong Israeli bias. After reflection, Johnson decided
                        to alter his report by substantially reducing the historical section.
                        (Telegram 1712 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, November 20;
                        ibid., 321.1/11–2061) Israel then launched a vigorous high-level effort to
                        force Johnson to return to the original text, but he refused. (Circular
                        telegram 1004, November 25; ibid., 325.84/11–2561) Although <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> members Turkey and France objected to the
                        alteration, the U.S. Representative noted that the changes did not affect
                        the report’s conclusions. (Telegram 1759 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, November 22; ibid., 325.84/11–2261)</p>
                    <p>On November 24, the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> transmitted the
                        report to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Secretariat under cover of
                        a letter stating that <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> members wished to
                        avoid passing judgment on the report’s historical sections but warmly
                        endorsed the report’s conclusions. For text of the transmittal letter and

                    <p>In response to your request, we have prepared the following comments upon the
                        question raised in National Security Action Memorandum No. 105:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I. United States Policy Toward the United
                            Arab Republic</hi></p>
                    <p>Our approach rests on four basic assumptions that appear valid at present,
                        namely, (1) <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is firmly enough
                        established to retain power in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>
                        for the time being; (2) were <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        to be overthrown soon (he is more vulnerable now than in the past several
                        years) the government which would emerge might well be less stable and more
                        troublesome for us; (3) despite the blow to his prestige from the loss of
                        Syria, continuation of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
                        considerable political influence in the Middle East and Afro-Asian world
                        generally is shown by the caution of the governments in those areas in
                        recognizing the new Syrian regime and in appointing ambassadors thereto; and
                        (4) the leadership in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> is striving
                        to strengthen its ties with the West.</p>
                    <p>Given these assumptions, and given the undoubted geo-political importance of
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>, it appears obvious that we must
                        continue to do business with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> and make the best of it. The
                        virtues and vices of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, nine
                        years after the Egyptian revolution, are well known. One virtue, the ability
                        to profit from experience, taken in conjunction with the fact of the
                        importance of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the U.A.R,
                        would appear to justify an effort on our part over the next few years to
                        endeavor to restore our relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> to
                        something resembling the pre-1955 period and to concentrate the attention of
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> more generally on internal
                        development.</p>
                    <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0392"/>
                    <p>While we are not enchanted by what <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> appears to have in mind with regard to both internal

                        publicly a statesmanlike attitude during the Syrian crisis, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has recouped some of his prestige; a

                        devote more attention and effort to internal development (and to securing

                        must be undertaken with utmost care. Not only are there our support of
                        Israel, a deep-seated Egyptian suspicion of our objectives and motives, and
                        serious divergences of U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>
                        policies, action and attitudes in Africa, in Latin America, and in the
                        Middle East itself which periodically lead to strains in our relations, but
                        also there are emerging the clear lines of the type of state <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is trying to establish in Egypt as
                        well as the nature of the political base he is seeking to create, and his
                        intention to abet the creation of similar states and similar power bases in
                        the other Arab states (except, perhaps, Iraq where these already exist to a

                        property, including that of hundreds of minority groups, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has precipitated Egypt into an “Arab
                        socialism” that eliminates private enterprise, domestic and foreign, from
                        any meaningful role in the Egyptian economy, that denies participation of
                        the ablest members of the Egyptian society in the development of the
                        country, that concentrates all economic power in the hands of the state, and
                        that perpetrates injustice in the name of “social justice”.</p>
                    <p>The political power base <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is now
                        seeking to create is not exactly attractive, resembling Peronism and
                        including some features of Mussolini’s corporate state. One foot is planted
                        in the Army, the other in the masses of dispossessed. In between are such
                        intellectuals and young people as can be persuaded to go along. The
                        structure of the monolithic <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0393"/>supporting political organization will be based on a selection of
                        membership according to occupations. What degree of enthusiasm will be found
                        in the general population remains to be seen as does the effect on the
                        loyalty of the Army. While we would not wish to imply that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s house will soon collapse about
                        him, we would question a policy of moving rapidly to shore him up or of
                        becoming too deeply committed to something in which we cannot believe and
                        with which cooperation is tenuous at best.</p>
                    <p>We also think it would be incorrect to assume that the energies of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> will be devoted entirely to internal affairs. While
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may reduce his activity in
                        Africa and in world-wide neutralist circles, he is unable to abandon or even
                        slacken in his self-assigned mission of leading and uniting all Arabs. Into

                            713, October 17. (Ibid., 786B.11/10–1761)</note> we read not only a need
                        to apply stern measures domestically but also, both to protect his program
                        at home and to achieve his wider ambitions in the Arab arena, to seek to
                        undermine and destroy the ruling elements in the other Arab states, with
                        most of which we have friendly relations, and who generally oppose his
                        ambitions and to create the image of the new Egypt in each one of them,
                        relying on those classes that most avidly desire “Arab unity” and worship
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. In pursuing the
                        experiment of seeking to draw closer to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> by
                        stressing assistance to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> plans for
                        development we must bear in mind that we shall in effect be strengthening a
                        leader and a state against other Arab states as well as against Israel.
                        Hence we may find it both desirable and necessary to increase our economic
                        and/or political support to certain other states of the area to the extent
                        required to preserve stability. A careful balance and impartiality in our
                        words and actions is essential.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Soviets, we believe that if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> requirements for developmental assistance are met
                        sufficiently (which may be difficult), it would seem unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would again wish to face eastward.
                        We would not rule out, however, a tacit unholy alliance between <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> agents and local Communists plus other
                        elements in the Arab states with a view to overturning existing regimes.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the negotiation of a multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 agreement with provision for annual review, selective
                            <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> and Export-Import Bank financing and
                        possibly a new approach to a stabilization program under <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> guidance, all of which we believe
                        appropriate in the circumstances, perhaps the only slight hope we have for
                        turning <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> in the direction we wish them to go is
                        personal diplomacy by <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0394"/>President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>. In the next few weeks we
                        may recommend to the President that in the absence of seriously adverse
                        public relations factors an invitation for a state visit be issued to
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> very early in the new
                        year, the visit to occur no later than early in March 1962. At that time the
                        President could bring to bear his great prestige and persuasiveness with a
                        view to heightening <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s sense of
                        statesmanship and bringing new perspective to his approach to domestic
                        development.</p>
                    <p>In putting forward briefly our views and our proposals above, we consider
                        that certain additional cautionary remarks are required. For more than three
                        years we have conducted our affairs with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> largely on the basis of “quiet diplomacy”, seeking to
                        avoid violent pendular swings in the state of our relations, to emphasize
                        those areas in which a satisfactory relationship is possible and to avoid
                        public controversy when we disagree. The fact that we may undertake to
                        expand economic assistance and to tighten our bonds will not lead the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> to lessen its fundamental hostility
                        toward Israel nor to adopt positions satisfactory to the U.S. on issues on
                        which our interests diverge. Further, it is essential in working out with
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> any given program that Egyptian
                        officials understand clearly at the outset the obligations they must assume
                        and the limits of the assistance within which we must work. In negotiating
                        programs with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> and in implementing
                        them, we must not seek to push too far too fast. A step by careful step
                        approach is called for. For years to come we expect the U.S. to bear most of
                        the obligations while giving the barest minimum in return. We must not
                        expect from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> more than its
                        circumstances permit, we must have infinite patience, we must not fluctuate
                        frequently in our policy and actions, and we must be prepared to deal in a
                        steady, consistent and understanding manner with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> despite the provocations we may be called upon to
                        endure. To do so will require a maturity and a constancy that will test our
                        statesmanship and the political sophistication of our public.</p>

                            Present Syrian Government and Implications for United States Policy
                            Toward Syria</hi></p>
                    <p>In respect of the question regarding the staying power of the present Syrian
                        regime there is enclosed a study prepared by the Department’s Bureau of
                        Intelligence and Research entitled “The Outlook for Stability in
                            Syria”.<note n="4" xml:id="d141fn4">Attached to the source text but not
                            printed.</note> As will be observed therein the prospects for political
                        stability are poor and hence our present principal political objective in
                        Syria is to strengthen the present friendly regime and to discourage
                        internal realignments detrimental to our interests. Actually the problem is
                        external as well. An unchanging fundamental in the Syrian equation is <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0395"/>practically unanimous Syrian fear
                        of Israel and widespread distrust of the principal Western friends of
                        Israel. This heritage we cannot escape, nor can we ameliorate it
                        satisfactorily. A further external complication is that historically Syria
                        has been a focus of area rivalries, the Egyptians pressing from one
                        direction, the Saudis from another, Iraq from the east, and Turkey from the
                        north. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>, of course, is in a
                        position to exert pressures both from without and from within Syria,
                        exploiting Syrian fear of Israel and the rivalries of other contenders, and
                        facilitating penetration by internal Communists. Further, the British and
                        French in the past have interfered in Syrian affairs. To the extent that
                        these pressures (including that of Israel) can be eased, Syria’s prospects
                        for stability will be enhanced. At the same time, to the extent that we
                        ourselves place pressure on Syria or interfere in Syrian domestic affairs we
                        shall not only reduce our influence but also shall hasten the process of
                        internal political deterioration we seek to impede.</p>
                    <p>We believe that our approach to the problem of Syria must be from several
                        directions concurrently: <list>

                                a more natural attraction for Syria than does Egypt other than the

                                security against Israel. Both Jordan and Iraq are believed to wish
                                to work out eventually a closer association with Syria, and many
                                Syrians believe that Syria should seek such a relationship with Iraq
                                and Jordan. While such a development, roughly the Fertile Crescent,
                                would probably be in our interest in tending to create a better
                                equilibrium in the Arab world and to concentrate the energies of the
                                three states for some time on the development of institutions and
                                operational frameworks, we believe that its stimuli must come from
                                within and that over-pressure in this direction would be
                                counter-productive not only in creating a negative reaction within

                                view the U.S. should in no way oppose such a development and upon

                                American countries to establish representation in Syria. Selected
                                Syrian political figures should be invited to the U.S. and Western
                                European countries should be encouraged to issue such invitations.
                                Other forms of educational and cultural exchange should be
                                encouraged. As appropriate, Syrian leaders should be assured that
                                the U.S. continues to be prepared to prevent aggression in the area.
                                Carefully selected anti-Communist intelligence and propaganda should
                                be disseminated by appropriate means. Efforts should be made to
                                direct Syrian arms requests to Western European countries and to
                                encourage those countries to satisfy such requests within reason (we
                                believe that ultimately the direction from which arms are supplied
                                to Syria will influence significantly the political stability and
                                political orientation of Syria.) We would seek an adequate but
                                unostentatious presence in Syria, limiting our personnel to the
                                extent compatible with requirements. Any form of intervention in
                                internal Syrian politics would be avoided. We firmly believe that
                                Syria, given half a chance, will prove both willing and able to
                                prevent Communist domination if Western nations conduct a sound
                                overt policy even though Syria may at times appear to be approaching
                                the brink. Further, we believe that Western intervention in Syrian
                                internal affairs would in fact only serve to strengthen the internal
                                Communists as well as Soviet Bloc influence. We should avoid seeking
                                to identify Syria with the West and equally should avoid public

                        with the West must be avoided yet a clear and beneficial political and

                        Syria and interference in Syrian internal affairs must be avoided. Since
                        achieving independence in 1945 the Syrians have been unable to rationalize
                        their internal affairs and we cannot do for them what they are unable to do
                        for themselves. Means must be found to satisfy such arms requirements as the

                    <p>Excluding Export-Import Bank loans, U.S. economic aid to Israel during the
                        past four years has been as follows: <list>
                            <item>1958—63.5 million</item>
                            <item>1959—50.8 million</item>

                            <item>1961—59.4 million (of which 10 million was actually received in
                                fiscal 1962)</item>

                    <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0399"/>
                    <p>This aid was made up of special assistance, <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480, and Development Loan funds. In addition,
                        Export-Import Bank loans, made at irregular intervals, have averaged 12.5
                        million per year in recent years.</p>
                    <p>Since special assistance is no longer available, economic aid to Israel
                        during 1962 must take the form of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480
                        aid, Development Loan type funds, and Export-Import Bank loans. The Israeli
                        government has indicated that it would prefer to have its Export-Import Bank
                        loans considered solely on their merits as bankable transactions for the
                        assistance of American industries, rather than as assistance to Israel, and
                        therefore excluded from any computation of aid.</p>
                    <p>The State Department is planning to recommend for 1962 about the same level
                        of aid to Israel as it has received in the past—between 60 and 65 million
                        dollars. It would, however, make up this sum by including <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 shipments of 26 million, Export-Import
                        Bank loans of approximately 20 million, and only 15 to 20 million in
                        Development Loans. Israel is very disappointed. It does not consider the
                        Export-Import loans as aid of the same nature as the other assistance.
                        Moreover, it argues that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, under the previous Administration, promised a level
                        of aid 30 million dollars higher than previously advanced to Israel in order
                        to compensate for lack of military assistance. (You will remember that Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> raised this
                        matter at his meeting with you.) Israel requests 25 to 27 million of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 assistance and 35 to 40 million of
                        Development Loans to equal the assistance it received in prior years
                        (excluding the 10 million it received early in July under a continuing
                        resolution which it regards as part of its fiscal 1961 aid). In addition, it
                        has asked for 30 million promised by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, making a total of about 90 million dollars, for
                        fiscal 1962.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that Israel receive assistance equal to that of prior years,
                        based on its own computations. That means, basically, that it should get
                        Development Loans of 35 to 40 million dollars in fiscal 1962.</p>

                                    with President David Dako. At that time President Dako had been
                                    regarded as veering strongly toward the Soviet Bloc because of
                                    (1) his conflict with the French on a number of issues, and (2)
                                    the fact that his country had been visited by many delegations
                                    from Soviet Bloc countries. The situation was of particular
                                    concern in the light of the Central African Republic’s important
                                    strategic position between Chad and the Congo. As a result of
                                    their discussions, President Dako asked for 15 advisors from
                                    Israel, together with 57 Central African Republic trainees to
                                    serve as supervisors of the various government programs. In
                                    addition, he asked for three people from Israel to serve as
                                    personal advisors to himself and nine people to serve as
                                    regional development officials. Although without funds, Mr.

                                <p>Between January and October 1961, 91 Tanganyikans were brought to
                                    Israel to participate in various projects. Among these were
                                    people designated to serve as permanent Secretaries of
                                    Ministries and in other similar posts. In October, immediately
                                    after his return from Great Britain, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Julius</persName> Nyerere met with Mr.

                                    unsuccessful in Great Britain in his search for assistance and
                                    talked about turning to Moscow and Peking.</p>
                                <p>He revealed his intention to create in Tanganyika a revolutionary
                                    youth movement that would develop his country in the way China
                                    and the Soviet Union had been developed.</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AE3">Avriel</persName> succeeded in
                                    pointing out that Tanganyika was less in need of a leadership
                                    that could mouth revolutionary phraseology than it was in the
                                    need of a trained youth that could put to use a spirit of
                                    dedication. Following the conversations Israel sent to
                                    Tanganyika the Director of a rural training institute to help
                                    establish a youth leadership and training center. In addition,

                        this problem. For a combination of reasons we believe (a) that for some time
                        to come, if not indefinitely, Israel can expect to enjoy relatively good
                        security despite the hostility and gradually increasing strength of her
                        neighbors; and (b) there is no good reason for the United States to change
                        its arms policy toward Israel. Our reasoning follows:</p>

                            <p>We understand that last spring Defense reviewed Israel’s situation
                                thoroughly from a military viewpoint and concluded that, while
                                    <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> (then including Syrian)
                                capabilities have increased relatively in recent years, there is
                                still a considerable Israeli advantage over-all and that acquisition
                                of “Mirage” aircraft by Israel should give Israel a clear edge in
                                the air. Informal advice from the Pentagon assures us that there
                                have been no developments since then that would alter this
                                assessment, nor does the Pentagon support the Israeli assertion that
                                in certain categories of ground equipment the combined Egyptian and
                                Syrian forces outnumber them. In terms of leadership, morale,
                                organization, training, logistics, maintenance and intelligence the
                                Israelis enjoy clear superiority. There is no sign of an abnormal

                                    sure, for they do not trust the West. So long as the West

                                    Arabs and Jews, there has not been a major Arab military action
                                    against Israel. Whereas perhaps a large majority of Arabs would
                                    like to destroy Israel by military means, they show no early
                                    intention (not to mention capability) of trying to do so despite
                                    Israeli claims that the Arabs plan a major attack in 1963. No
                                    Arab leader can run the risk of sustaining serious military
                                    defeat, nor is the domestic situation of any Arab state so
                                    desperate as to drive it to foreign aggression. We simply cannot
                                    accept the Israeli thesis.</item>

                            <item>That Israel not come to feel politically isolated and/or in grave
                                military jeopardy, lest she be tempted to engage in pre-emptive

                                Syria, or both. Hence our need to give adequate heed to Israel’s
                                political interests and particularly to her requests for economic

                        <item>The U.S. must not take the neutralists too seriously or let their
                            position on world issues annoy us. It is a major asset of this
                            Administration that it is believed to be prepared to help the
                            neutralists maintain their independence, despite disagreements on some
                            world issues; and this asset should not be lost. In particular, he hoped
                            that we would not break off our connection with Tito who, on balance, is
                            a major Free World asset. U.S.-Yugoslav relations are taken as a
                            touchstone of U.S. policy by some of the neutralists.</item>

                        <item>Arab-Israeli relations in the Middle East are quiet; in his view they
                            should be left alone for a time. The possibilities of a more basic
                            settlement will gradually emerge as domestic progress is made by all

                        <item>The U.S. should try to bring the Arab states together on a
                            constructive basis; but if that is not possible, it should avoid setting

                            leadership within the Free World or we are being devious in letting our

                        refugees is scheduled to begin shortly after November 27. We have done
                        considerable spadework to persuade both Arabs and Israelis of the wisdom of
                        avoiding an acrimonious debate like that of last spring. Nevertheless, the
                        debate promises to be a rough affair, with the United States getting at
                        least as many brickbats as thanks for our efforts. The Arabs will probably
                        press for several proposals designed to embarrass and hurt Israel, including
                        appointment of a United Nations custodian of former Arab properties in
                        Israel, reconstitution of the Palestine Conciliation Commission (<gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>), appointment of a Commission to inquire
                        into the status of the Arab minority in Israel, and official recognition of
                        a delegation of Palestinian Arabs who have come to New York for the coming
                        debate. On its side, Israel is preparing itself for vigorous counterattack.
                        Armed with a Ben-Gurion statement and Government-sponsored Knesset motion
                        openly contradictory to United Nations resolutions which would permit some

                        to float for tactical purposes a resolution calling for direct Arab-Israel
                        peace negotiations. We do not regard any of these possible proposals as
                        helpful in terms of a practical advance on the refugee problem.</p>
                    <p>You will recall our sponsorship earlier this fall of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>’s appointment of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_JJE1">Joseph E. Johnson</persName> (Carnegie Endowment) as
                        Special Representative to undertake an exploratory mission to the Middle
                        East on the refugee problem. Dr. Johnson reports three basic conclusions:
                        (1) there is a very guarded willingness on the part of both Arab and Israeli
                        leaders to consider some gradual step-by-step process towards solution of
                        the refugee problem, (2) the Special Representative function should <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0407"/>be continued for about one more
                        year to permit more thorough examination of the possibilities of a
                        step-by-step solution, and (3) it will be necessary even under the most
                        optimistic assumptions to continue international assistance to the refugees
                        for at least a decade.<note n="3" xml:id="d145fn3">Johnson submitted his
                            report on November 24; see <ref target="#d140">Document

                    <p>Our objectives at the General Assembly are clear-cut. In terms of a
                        resolution, we will seek support for two main elements of Dr. Johnson’s
                        findings: (1) the continuation for one year of the unobtrusive diplomatic
                        effort already initiated by the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> (i.e.,
                        the Special Representative), and (2) assent to a limited extension of the
                        mandate of the United Nations refugee relief agency (<gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>) now scheduled to expire on June 30,
                        1963. We believe this path offers the best hope for progress in an
                        admittedly unpromising situation. We intend to press resolutely for our two
                        proposals. Our general posture will be to examine other proposals from any
                        quarter with an eye to their probable effect on the advancement of the
                            <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> effort. This may entail opposition
                        to Israeli as well as Arab initiatives, but we are anxious to avoid a role
                        that would identify us as the special pleader for the partisan
                        considerations of either side. Only thus can we hope to fortify our position
                        as an objective party seeking constructive action in the interests of the
                        refugees and area stability.</p>
                    <p>Our proposed positions on the proposals which may be introduced by the Arabs
                        and Israelis, respectively, are as follows:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Custodian of Former
                            Refugee Properties in Israel:</hi> We are opposed to this proposal,
                        which is impractical, has dangerous implications for the future of Israel,
                        and is based upon erroneous legal assumptions. We will vote against the
                        proposal if necessary. We do not believe the complicated legal issues
                        involved can properly be resolved by a body such as the <gloss target="#t_SPC1">SPC</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.
                        Privately, we regard the ICJ as an appropriate institution to which such
                        legally contentious issues can be referred, and would not oppose such
                        referral if it is urged by others.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Israel-Sponsored Motion for Direct Arab-Israel
                            Negotiations:</hi> Since there is not the slightest prospect of the
                        Arabs agreeing to sit down with the Israelis, we think this proposal could
                        offer no practical result in advancing the interests of the refugees or a
                        solution of the problem. (We recognize, however, that its introduction later
                        as a counter to equally unhelpful Arab proposals might serve our interests.
                        This would be the case if, by opposing it as well as Arab proposals, we
                        could enhance our posture as a non-partisan supporter of progress along
                        realistic lines.) For the foregoing reasons, we propose to vote against the
                        Israeli proposal if necessary.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> Reconstitution:</hi>
                        The <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> is now made up of France, Turkey,
                        and the United States, a composition with which the Israelis are satisfied
                            <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0408"/>and the Arabs suspicious. While
                        ultimately some benefit might derive from the addition of a few responsible
                        neutrals less open to accusations of pro-Israel bias, efforts at this
                        session to reconstitute the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> would not be
                        helpful to that body’s current initiative, and might raise the specter of
                        application of the Soviet “troika” principle in a Near Eastern context. We
                        have made this clear to all concerned but are prepared to re-examine our
                        position should broad support for the proposal develop. However, we consider
                        it unlikely to be pressed seriously by the Arabs.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Inquiry into Status of Arabs in Israel:</hi> Israel
                        representatives have tentatively indicated Israel might welcome a United
                        Nations inquiry into the situation of Israel’s Arab population. A greater
                        probability, in our view, is that Israel would counter such an Arab
                        proposal, if made, by demanding a parallel investigation into the status of
                        Jews in the Arab countries. Should this issue arise, we would decide our
                        position in the light of the tactical situation then prevailing.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Palestine Arab Delegation”:</hi> As in previous years, our
                        position remains that membership of any Palestinian group should be heard by
                        the <gloss target="#t_SPC1">SPC</gloss> as individuals only and not
                        officially recognized as “The” delegation representing all Palestine Arabs.
                        This helps preclude an “Algerianization” of the Palestine problem. Should a
                        proposal that the <gloss target="#t_SPC1">SPC</gloss> hear “The Palestine
                        Arab Delegation”, as such, be pressed to a vote, we would vote

                    <p>The Foreign Minister apologized for taking time from the Secretary’s busy
                        schedule, but said that consultations seemed indicated on matters which
                        Israel deemed vital. The Secretary replied that he was always happy to see
                        the Foreign Minister.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> stated that, in Israel’s
                        view, there were four major issues with respect to the General Assembly’s
                        current consideration of the Palestine refugee item. It was her
                        understanding that the United States and Israel had identical positions on
                        three of these issues; namely, those concerning “The Palestine Arab
                        Delegation,” the Arab property custodian proposal, and reconstitution of the
                        Palestine Conciliation Commission. On the fourth issue, that of strategy and
                        tactics in the Special Political Committee, there seemed to be differences
                        of opinion.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister described how the proposal calling for direct
                        negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors was initiated. The idea
                        stemmed from visits to Israel by several presidents of African countries.
                        They had expressed concern about the lack of international understanding of
                        Israel’s position on the Palestine refugee question, and they had indicated
                        a desire to do something about this situation. Recently Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> had suggested that Israel put
                        forward a positive proposal of its own, rather than merely to react
                        negatively to Arab proposals. <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0410"/>Even
                        without any support from the United States, the “peace negotiations” draft
                        resolution favored by Israel already had about 26 supporters.<note n="1" xml:id="d146fn1">The possible draft resolution called for direct
                            negotiations between Israel and the Arab states. A similar draft
                            resolution, sponsored by 14 nations, most of them from Africa, was
                            defeated by the Special Political Committee of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> General Assembly on December 19.

                            321.1.</note> Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> asked the
                        Secretary if he could not see a positive element, at least in the tactical
                        sense, in there being on the table a “constructive” draft as a counter to
                        “destructive” Arab proposals. She expressed understanding of the U.S.
                        position which favored the continuation of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>-Johnson initiative, but maintained that the tabling of a
                        resolution calling for negotiations would help rather than hinder the
                        attainment of the United States objective in the General Assembly. It would
                        be useful in demonstrating considerable Afro-Asian support for a moderate
                        approach. For the Afro-Asian countries which were not ill-disposed towards
                        Israel, it would be much easier to support a positive resolution than merely
                        to oppose Arab demands.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that if it were possible, he would prefer there be no
                        debate this year on the Palestine refugee problem. There had been too much
                        talk on this issue in the public forum. However, as usual, a debate appeared
                        inevitable. We would be happy if this Assembly’s consideration resulted in
                        no resolution, for none was needed. Our position was motivated by a desire
                        to insure adequate resources for the refugees and to move forward on this
                        problem as much as possible. We considered the Johnson approach to be the
                        best one in the circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Noting that “The Palestine Arab Delegation” had bitterly attacked Dr.
                        Johnson’s report, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> stated
                        that her Delegation would not speak against the Johnson effort. Given the
                        Arab attitude, there was no hope whatsoever for a moderate debate. Would it
                        not be better to have something on the table from both sides? The Secretary
                        wondered if the negotiations proposal favored by Israel would have any
                        practical result. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> said that
                        even if it were not voted on, or if voted on and defeated, it probably would
                        not have been a fruitless exercise. She recalled that the Arabs and other
                        elements in the General Assembly had been pounding away on the theme of
                        negotiations to solve various disputes; for example, those between the
                        Netherlands and Indonesia and between Austria and Italy. Israel was not
                        requesting active U.S. support for the proposed resolution. It was asking
                        that the United States Delegation to the United Nations be instructed to
                        inform other delegations that the U.S. did not oppose the floating of the
                        negotiations proposal, and, moreover, considered it to be of tactical
                        utility.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary observed that our problem was not so much with the content of
                        the Israeli proposal. However, there were two or three Arab proposals which
                        the U.S. must oppose. Our opposition to these would result in considerable
                        oratorical blood-letting. This sort of situation created problems in our
                        relations with other states; such was the case last spring. The Secretary
                        reiterated that currently our major effort was directed towards the
                        continuation of the Johnson Mission.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> said that even if the United
                        States did not particularly want a resolution, the Arabs certainly would
                        press for custodianship and probably other unacceptable proposals, so why
                        should there not be on the table something constructive from the other side?
                        She expressed willingness, if the United States so advised, to ask Israel’s
                        friends to defer tabling their resolution until after the Arab resolution
                        was tabled. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> noted that
                        while the proposed Israeli resolution might have some value as an element of
                        tactical balance, its value to the United States would lie in our not being
                        for it. The Foreign Minister said that she would be pleased if, when asked
                        about the negotiations proposal by such delegations as the Norwegian or
                        Swedish, <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> indicated understanding of
                        its tactical advantage. However, if the United States were to indicate a
                        negative position on the proposal, the extremist Arab demands might win
                        Assembly approval, for other delegations would conclude that the U.S. was no
                        longer concerned about Israel’s basic interests in the United Nations
                        context. She stated that if such Arab proposals as custodianship or a
                        radical overhaul of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> were endorsed by
                        the Assembly, this would bring to an end all of Israel’s attempts to
                        cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that he would not wish other delegations to draw the
                        inference, from comments <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> might make
                        regarding the Israeli proposal, that the United States might vote in favor
                        of it. He stressed that it was much more important to insure that
                        custodianship was not approved, and the United States would appraise the
                        various tactical alternatives with this in mind. In response to the
                        Secretary’s inquiry, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>
                        speculated that the custodianship proposal might be approved again by the
                            <gloss target="#t_SPC1">SPC</gloss>, but that two-thirds approval in
                        Plenary was probably not as likely.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister noted that something which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PFTP1">Plimpton</persName> had suggested earlier in the day
                        in New York had worried her considerably. She said the Ambassador had
                        proposed that Israel try to prove that property abandoned by Arab refugees
                        and taken over by the state had, in fact, been condemned by the Israeli
                        Government for “public <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0412"/>use” in
                        accordance with the 1947 Partition Resolution.<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">Reference is to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> General
                            Assembly resolution concerning the future Government of Palestine that
                            provided for a plan of partition with economic union, adopted by the
                            General Assembly on November 29, 1947. For text, see Official Records of
                            the General Assembly, Second Session, Resolutions, 16 September–29
                            November 1947.</note> The Foreign Minister described this as a very
                        dangerous idea. Israel was, after all, a sovereign state. It stood ready to
                        pay compensation for former Arab property and was willing to cooperate with
                        the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> efforts to effect compensation
                        arrangements. This was quite enough; Israel was not prepared to go further
                        and help to set the stage for Arab demands for a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> investigation regarding the “public use” of the properties
                        in question. (Note: What Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PFTP1">Plimpton</persName> actually suggested was that Israel be prepared to
                        defend itself against possible contention that its condemnation of property
                        abandoned by the Arabs was not in the “public use” category.)</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> reported that “The Palestine
                        Arab Delegation” had already asked for its nameplates in anticipation of
                        being seated in the <gloss target="#t_SPC1">SPC</gloss>. Although the
                        Bulgarian Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_SPC1">SPC</gloss> had informed
                        Mr. Chai of the Secretariat that he was willing to have this problem handled
                        more or less as it had been in the past, the Saudi Arabian Delegate,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA12">Shukairy</persName>, probably would ask for
                        a vote. Thus it was important that other delegations knew well in advance
                        where the United States stood. The Foreign Minister said that if the
                        Committee were to recognize this “Delegation”, the Grand Mufti would
                        undoubtedly organize a provisional government of Palestine and the Arabs
                        would be greatly encouraged in their efforts to destroy Israel. At the
                        least, they would seriously attempt to revert the situation back to the 1947
                        Partition Plan.</p>
                    <p>Going back to the question of possible resolutions, the Secretary said there
                        were two considerations. One was the matter of our attitude towards the
                        introduction of resolutions on this item at this session, and the second was
                        the matter of our position regarding such resolutions as might be
                        introduced. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> held that the
                        effect of a U.S. stance of disfavor vis-à-vis both the prospective Arab and
                        Israeli proposals would be to weaken the tactical value of the Israeli
                        proposal. Certainly U.S. opposition to custodianship was not going to deter
                        the Arabs from introducing that proposition. The Secretary said that it
                        appeared better to him for the United States to take the position that it
                        did not like either the Arab or the Israeli proposals. Of course, we could
                        not very well ask the Israelis to put in their resolution so that we could
                        vote against something besides Arab proposals.</p>
                    <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0413"/>
                    <p>With further regard to the Johnson Mission, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> stated flatly that Israel believed nothing would come
                        of this endeavor. The reason was simply that the Arabs would not cooperate
                        in any constructive approach. The Arabs did not wish to have progress made
                        on the refugee problem except in a manner that would harm Israel. Israel was
                        continuing to go along with the Johnson approach only because the United
                        States felt so strongly about it.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> noted that in 1952
                        the United States supported a resolution calling for direct negotiations
                        between the Arabs and Israel. The Secretary said that we must all try to
                        keep our eye on the big problem; to keep trying to make tiny steps towards a
                        solution. In this context we must try to keep as much fever as possible out
                        of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of the problem. If
                        the United States were to oppose Arab proposals, and then vote in favor of
                        an Israeli proposal, the fever would be augmented. On the face of it, he
                        said, who could oppose a call for negotiations? Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> asked how the U.S. could conceivably
                        vote against such a proposal. The Secretary reiterated that inasmuch as we
                        were opposing some things the Arabs want, it would needlessly add to the
                        anger in this situation if we voted for an Israeli resolution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> noted that the Israeli proposal
                        might appear to be a logical challenge to the Arab position, but asked if it
                        would serve to advance the problem. The Foreign Minister said that the Arabs
                        had already secured too much support for the proposition that peace was a
                        good thing except in the Near East. She speculated that even if Dr. Johnson
                        were to secure from King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, for
                        instance, a promise to cooperate, the King would not dare publicly so to
                        indicate. The Johnson approach and all of the other quiet efforts designed
                        to achieve “underground understandings” would have no effect as long as the
                        above ground realities of Arab politics remained as they were. The refugees
                        were above ground, not underground, and the Arab leaders apparently feel
                        they cannot politically afford to compromise on this issue.</p>
                    <p>Reverting again to Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>’s request,
                        the Secretary emphasized that he was extremely reluctant to open the
                        possibility of any misunderstanding by other delegations regarding our
                        attitude towards any resolution that would render more difficult the job
                        that had to be done after the debate. He noted that the very debate might
                        torpedo the Johnson Mission. The Foreign Minister’s request was not
                        something to which an <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0414"/>automatic
                        answer should be given. The Secretary said that we would like to consider it
                            overnight.<note n="3" xml:id="d146fn3">On December 1, the Department
                            transmitted to <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> a summary of the

                            regarding custodianship, <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>
                            reconstitution, and recognition of the Palestine Arab Delegation; b)
                            having considered <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>’s comments,
                            now intended to submit a moderate draft resolution which would support
                            practical moves for progress; and c) would tell other delegations in
                            regard to the Israeli direct negotiations resolution that it did not
                            encourage submission of proposals by either side that would tend to
                            undercut the quiet diplomatic approach exemplified by the Johnson
                            mission, but expected the Israelis to pursue their tactics as they saw
                            fit. (Telegram 1413; Department of State, Central Files,

                            meeting, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> made clear: “We
                            were to understand this as a major political move by Egypt with respect
                            to the U.S. and the West. Forces were moving very rapidly in Egypt and
                            if we wished to keep Egypt out of dangerous hands we should respond as
                            promptly as possible. Specifically, he asked that these two matters be
                            taken as promptly as possible to the highest levels of the government.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> also noted that he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>, who also attended the
                            meeting, “concluded that Egypt is in bad shape; desperately needs help;
                            and is prepared to pay some substantial political price in terms of
                            Western orientation for prompt and sustained economic assistance.”
                            (Kennedy Library, President’s Office Files, Staff Memoranda, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow, Walt W.</persName>, 6/61–12/61)</note> In
                        this connection the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> also hoped that
                        the U.S. would accede to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> ’s
                        previous request for a multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador stated that he felt the U.S. was being offered a unique
                        opportunity to strengthen its position in a country which has considerable
                        influence in both Africa and the Middle East and thereby to help prevent the
                        penetration of communism into this area.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> indicated he would
                        communicate this information to interested U.S. Government officials.</p>
                    <p>In a subsequent conversation the Ambassador admonished Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJR2">Barrow</persName> to endeavor to prevent anyone from
                        creating the impression that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> is
                        unstable. He said that the U.S. Government could be sure that the present
                        Government of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> would be in
                        existence for a long time to come, but even if it were not, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> had been and would continue to be a
                        country of utmost geopolitical importance. He therefore felt it was in the
                        U.S.’s own best interests to take advantage of the opportunity being
                        offered, irrespective of its attitude toward the present <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> Government.</p>

                    <p>As Embassy aware, we seized with unanswered request by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> for consideration multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 sales agreement including wheat and other
                        commodities. Multi-year program request from Israel also pending. Under
                        present circumstances we believe <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        multi-year agreement, if undertaken, should precede any other in <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> area. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s
                        present efforts execute coordinated plan appear qualify it as possible
                        candidate for multi-year sales arrangement under general criteria announced
                        by U.S. In interest of stabilizing relations with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> we should not turn down their request without having very
                        sound, comprehensible reasons for doing so.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that in making long term commitment of this nature some short
                        term bargaining power might be lost but consider that multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 arrangement could provide basis for
                        greater confidence for conduct relations and reinforce existing favorable
                        trends.</p>
                    <p>We had hoped development of stabilization program for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> through consultation with <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> might provide appropriate setting for negotiation

                    <p>In introducing subject with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>,
                        you may wish note with satisfaction improvement in US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations that has attended expanded
                        economic cooperation of past three years and confirm our sympathy for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s sound economic development. You may
                        recall that we were asked conclude single-year arrangement to meet <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s urgent requirements for wheat and other
                        commodities pending study of possibility of multi-year program and we
                        agreed. You may wish point out that to date only limited number of longer
                        term arrangements made, such as that with India in which significant
                        contribution to India’s third five-year plan and other essential economic
                        considerations were identified. Establishment of Agency for International
                        Development emphasizes and affirms our interest in using our available
                        resources including food to support well designed and executed programs of
                        economic development. You should stress we prepared in principle work out
                        multi-year arrangement with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> but have
                        only most general understanding as to extent such major undertaking on our
                        part, amounting perhaps to several hundred million dollars, would be
                        justified on economic grounds. You would propose, therefore, that
                        arrangements be made for technically qualified representatives of both
                        governments explore matter in detail as basis for possible subsequent
                        negotiation of multi-year arrangement. This connection you might wish
                        indicate in general terms such relevant questions as (1) specific economic
                        development projects to which Egyptian pound proceeds would be allocated,
                        and (2) projections over next several years of foreign exchange shortfall
                        occasioned by economic development spending. As necessary should be made
                        clear that in proposing this review U.S. does not seek inject itself into or
                        interfere with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policy and planning
                        processes. Rather we seek identify what manner and what extent our food
                        resources will support <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s own development
                        effort. May be useful mention that in other connections <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> officials have indicated interest in
                        technical cooperation with respect planning and we of course desire be
                        helpful as possible in this area. In conclusion you might indicate to
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that, if this procedure
                        meets his approval, we would be prepared commence these exploratory

                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. As you’ll see, I feel
                        that now is the time to move, and suggest how.</p>
                    <p>Am sure Walt at least agrees, particularly in light of his latest chat with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Phil Talbot</persName> may still counsel waiting till January when
                        we’ll have a better idea of whether <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will still be Mr. Big. However, this is already
                        December, so unless we get decision now we won’t be ready then.</p>
                    <p>What I’m proposing is really little different from State’s own thinking. The
                        chief difference is one of style. I’d like to see us give <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> the impression we’re opening a new
                        chapter, using as bait the very substantial aid we’re probably going to give
                        him anyway. Otherwise we’ll tend to dole out this aid in little packages,
                        without getting as much leverage from it as we might reasonably expect.</p>

                        <p>A Shift in Policy Toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName></p>
                        <p>Attached are two State Department papers bearing on what your staff has
                            regarded from the beginning as one of the major foreign policy problems
                            confronting your Administration. The first is in response to <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> #105 asking what policy we should
                            pursue toward Egypt in the aftermath of the Syrian coup,<note n="1" xml:id="d149fn1"><ref target="#d141">Document 141</ref>.</note> and
                            the other draft State Department policy guidelines toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2">Reference
                                is to one of a series of policy guideline papers initially prepared
                                in the Department of State under the overall coordination of the
                                Policy Planning Council, and then circulated to other agencies for
                                comment and revised accordingly. A master set of the drafts and
                                commentaries, organized alphabetically by country, is in Department

                        <p>In both, State cautiously suggests a somewhat more forthcoming policy
                            towards <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>—a policy of
                            limited objectives but one which will set us on the path toward a more
                            constructive relationship resembling that of the pre-1955 period, and
                            break the vicious circle of aloofness in US/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations which has persisted since the Aswan Dam
                                fiasco.<note n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">Reference is to U.S. withdrawal
                                on July 19, 1956, of an earlier offer to explore funding for the
                                construction of an Aswan High Dam.</note> State stresses, however,
                            the basic conflicts of interest which sharply limit the feasible extent
                            of any rapprochement. Of course, dealing with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> partakes of all the problems of
                            dealing with a charismatic neutralist leader whose ambitions and
                            interests in many ways run athwart our own. In particular, the
                            Arab-Israeli vendetta and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s ambitions in Africa and the Near East create
                            special difficulties in our relationship.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, we are processing a whole series of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> aid requests of one sort or another, arising largely
                            from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s current desperate economic
                            straits: (a) the multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480
                            request; (b) a grain storage project for which a $72 million <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loan is requested; (c) a request for
                            350,000 bales of short-staple cotton; (d) a probable request for rice;
                            (e) the Nubian monuments; (f) the insecticide request; and (g) <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>’s recent approach requesting
                            economic planners as preliminary to a US-backed consortium. State would
                            apparently continue to dole these out gradually without any fanfare, as
                            an exercise in quiet diplomacy.</p>

                                    mood after the Syrian debacle. This, plus serious domestic
                                    economic difficulties and some concern over his internal
                                    political position, is leading him to turn more inward, in an
                                    effort to revivify the Egyptian revolution. To help him do so
                                    would be quite in our interest. And Egypt’s near bankruptcy,
                                    which has led to his new aid requests, creates a real
                                    opportunity.</item>

                                    is hard to separate out how much this is based on <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>’s own desire to promote a

                                <item>Meanwhile Soviet/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations
                                    are uneasy, with obvious divergencies over Syria and Iraq,
                                    creating an opportunity we can exploit. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has already reoriented
                                    his policy to a significant extent: (a) he has put the Israeli
                                    issue on ice, at least for the moment; (b) he has apparently
                                    decided to rely primarily on the West for new development aid if
                                    he can; and (c) he has been shifting Egyptian cotton trade back
                                    toward Western markets after some unhappy experiences with the
                                        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Moscow’s veto of
                                    Kuwait’s <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> application is merely
                                    the latest indication of divergent Soviet and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> aims. Both realize this, but
                                    Moscow is making new aid offers in an effort to keep Cairo from
                                    moving even farther away. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will feel compelled to accept them if he
                                    has no other recourse.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>On the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
                            current domestic difficulties may make it premature to attempt a major
                            approach to him now. Who knows, he may not survive. This may be the
                            case, though most Arab specialists doubt that he’s as shaky as all that.
                            In any case, if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            disappeared, he would probably be succeeded by one or another of the new
                            military elite who would be equally susceptible to a more forthcoming
                            U.S. policy. I <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0422"/>doubt that
                            withholding greater support from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> because of the possibility he may fall is a very
                            useful playing of the odds.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">What could we accomplish?</hi> As State points out, the
                            best we could achieve from a more forthcoming policy toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would be a strictly limited
                            marriage of convenience; our interests run sharply athwart each other at
                            too many points. At least in the early phases, moreover, we would be
                            giving a lot more than we would get in return. Nor can we woo <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> away from being a neutralist and
                            nationalist (any more than Moscow could).</p>
                        <p>But what we might hope to achieve through a more professedly forthcoming
                            policy is to create a vested interest on his part in better US/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations, which would in itself
                            inhibit him from taking actions which would upset it. Let us remember
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> could cause us a lot
                            more trouble if he were actively hostile—in Libya, North Africa, Sudan,
                            Syria, or on Suez transit and <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> oil, to
                            mention but a few instances. Thus perhaps our greatest gains would be
                            negative; we would not get a great deal from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, but at least we might restrain him from doing a
                            lot of things we don’t like. Finally, let’s not forget we also share
                            certain common interests with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>—he’s as anxious as we are not to see undue Soviet
                            penetration into the Middle East. A more satisfactory relationship would
                            enable us to talk more frankly with him about where we agree as well as
                            disagree.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">This immediately brings up the Israeli problem.</hi>
                            One cannot propose a new initiative toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> without assessing its likely impact on Israel and
                            its supporters in the US. The Israelis have said they would applaud
                            rather than oppose an effort to turn <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s energies inward, but they are not unaware that
                            any strengthening of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> may
                            eventually be at their expense. However, any rapprochement which led to
                            increased US influence over <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would give us more leverage to restrain him to
                            some extent. Indeed, as part of any new policy initiative, we should
                            make perfectly clear to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            our inability to support him against Israel; and, being on a more
                            friendly basis with him, we would be better able to make such noises
                            without generating a sharp reaction. The Arab-Israeli issue is one on
                            which the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and US would simply have
                            to agree to disagree.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Finally, what would this initiative cost us if it
                                failed?</hi> It would not involve spending much more money on Egypt
                            than I daresay we will spend in one way or another anyway (without
                            getting full benefit from it). And if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> rejects our feelers, or if a rapprochement later
                            became unstuck, it’s hard to see how we would be much worse off than we
                            were before. Would it precipitate Egypt any further into the arms of the
                            Russians than if we had not tried at all?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">What Next?—An Action Program</hi>. Since we are already
                            contemplating some very substantial aid to Egypt (especially if we form
                            a consortium), <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0423"/>what is needed
                            is to package and present this in a manner which will signal to the
                            Egyptians the New Frontier’s desire to be more forthcoming than its
                            predecessor (and also what we might expect from them). Thus the chief
                            ingredient to be added would be a new style and tone in our approach.
                            What we might do is package the several aid projects under consideration
                            in such form as to make them cumulatively impressive, and use them as
                            the basis for a new diplomatic initiative, perhaps along the following
                            lines: <list>

                    <p>I believe it is timely to call to your attention and to that of other senior
                        officers of the Department the situation that is developing in Iraq. In
                        brief, prior to late June, 1961, there had been signs of a gradual
                        orientation away from the Soviet Bloc, but since the time that Kuwait, which
                        is claimed by Iraq, began to receive international recognition as a state
                        following the new political and security arrangement between Britain and
                        Kuwait on June 19,<note n="1" xml:id="d150fn1">During a meeting of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Security Council on November 30,
                            the United States and nine other members of the Security Council voted
                            in favor of a draft resolution, introduced by the United Arab Republic,
                            that contained a Security Council recommendation to the General Assembly
                            that Kuwait be admitted to the United Nations. Kuwait was eventually
                            admitted to the United Nations on May 14, 1963.</note> Iraq has moved
                        increasingly toward the Soviet Bloc in the conduct of Iraqi political and
                        economic affairs and in its propaganda position. During this process, until
                        recently, the Iraqi Government gradually increased its repressive measures
                        against domestic communists, to the point that we came to believe that
                        communist ability to threaten the security of the Iraqi state had been
                        neutralized.</p>
                    <p>Now, however, we believe a new phase may have been opened. Perhaps as the
                        tacit price for the recent Soviet veto of Kuwait’s application for
                        membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">The Soviet Union voted against the draft resolution on
                            Kuwait.</note> the Iraqi Government in the past two weeks has taken
                        several steps which appear to permit the internal communists to strengthen
                        considerably their internal position. In addition, Iraq has taken the
                        drastic step of expropriating all of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                        (and affiliates) <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0425"/>concessionary

                            December 11, an Iraqi Government decree nullified the exploitation

                            172,000 square miles. Negotiations between the Iraqi Government and the
                            Iraq Petroleum Company to revise the concession had begun in August 1958
                            and were broken off on October 12, 1961, when <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> refused to accede to several Iraqi demands. Standard

                            Supplement, the compilation on Iraq.</note> The Iraqi action against
                            <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> was more drastic than we had reason
                        several weeks ago to believe would be the case. Again it would appear that
                        the Iraqi action, while calculated to avoid causing <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> to cease or decrease production, may have been more severe
                        than originally intended in order to compensate the Soviet Union for its
                        veto and in order to attract stronger Soviet support against inevitable
                            <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> and Western pressures. It is, of
                        course, possible that further measures against <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> are being contemplated.</p>
                    <p>The situation in Iraq, therefore, appears to be returning to something like
                        the post-revolutionary period in 1958 and 1959, during which there was great
                        alarm that Iraq was going communist. While in that period there were no
                        issues between Iraq and the West other than the communist threat, now two
                        other issues between Iraq and the West are included in the unhappy equation:
                        (1) Iraq’s claim to Kuwait, strongly pressed by Iraq’s present leadership
                        and (2) Iraq’s unilateral violation of a major Western economic arrangement
                        with Iraq, <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>As a result of Iraqi action against <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>, we
                        consider it possible the Department will be urged to retaliate against and
                        place other pressures on Iraq. Likewise, as the Iraqi communists regain an
                        important role in Iraq and appear to threaten Iraqi independence, there is
                        likely to develop within the U.S. a strong feeling that we should intervene
                        in Iraqi affairs. It would appear that Iraqi leadership intends to play a
                        game of brinksmanship in its efforts to gain control of Kuwait and to obtain
                        at least part ownership of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>, utilizing
                        Soviet support and frightening the West by permitting the resurgence of
                        internal communism. That Iraq will use military force against Kuwait cannot
                        be ruled out, although there would appear to be cogent reasons against doing
                        so despite the richness of the prize.</p>
                    <p>From the Iraqi revolution on July 14, 1958 until the new British arrangement
                        with Kuwait on June 19, 1961 the U.S. followed a policy of patience,
                        tolerance, and scrupulous nonintervention toward Iraq. That policy paid
                        dividends in the form of a gradual improvement in the atmosphere of
                        U.S.-Iraqi relations and there appeared to be a prospect of <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0426"/>even more fruitful relations including
                        increased Iraqi importation of U.S. goods and services. However, following
                        our declaration of open support for the independence of Kuwait and our
                        approval of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> military intervention in
                        Kuwait, in both of which we had no suitable alternative, we were informed by
                        the Iraqi Government that we had made a mistake and U.S.-Iraqi relations
                        would suffer. The full ramification of Iraqi intentions is now becoming
                        clear.</p>
                    <p>Short of direct military intervention, whether by U.S. forces alone or in
                        conjunction with others or by Iraq’s neighbors friendly to the West (Turkey,
                        Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia), we lack effective means of achieving a
                        reversal in Iraqi policy. While cessation of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> production would not now appear likely, we believe that, if
                        a decision were made to stop production, it would not necessarily create the
                        desired effect and might well create even greater problems.</p>
                    <p>While it is clear that we must in due course openly object to the Iraqi move
                        against <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> and must consider whether to
                        endeavor to prevent Iraq from gaining from its unilateral breach of an
                        important contractual obligation, we believe that we must exercise due
                        caution in the manner and intensity of our official resistance to the Iraqi
                        action. Further, we believe we must resist firmly all efforts to force us to
                        undertake intervention of any type in the internal affairs of Iraq unless
                        and until it is clear that the domestic communists stand to gain control of
                        Iraq in absence of such intervention. In the present circumstances, for the
                        U.S. and/or its friends to place severe pressure on Iraq or to intervene
                        ineffectively in Iraq would only serve to increase the likeli<persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> of a situation we do not want: a
                        communist takeover.</p>
                    <p>We cannot guarantee that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_QGAK1">Qassim</persName> will not prove to be another Castro, though his past
                        actions in reducing the Iraqi communists to relative impotence would justify
                        the conclusion that he is an Iraqi and Arab nationalist and that he does not
                        wish Iraq to fall under external control whether directly or indirectly. We
                        believe, however, that he is capable of playing a serious game of
                        brinksmanship with the Soviets and internal communists in pursuing his great
                        nationalistic objectives.</p>
                    <p>Our objective is to the best of our ability to avoid pushing Iraq further
                        along its present path and to endeavor to persuade certain of our allies and
                        friends to pursue a similar course. In so doing the Department will be
                        obliged to resist pressures from both within and without the U.S. Government
                        to make statements and undertake actions that would be detrimental to the
                        achievement of our objective. That there is serious risk in this course may
                        be a frequent charge. That there would be serious risk in doing otherwise is
                        our considered opinion.</p>

                        <item>Mike feels strongly that any <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit must be quiet, without undue fanfare. He
                            recalled that the ceremony surrounding King Saud’s visit<note n="1" xml:id="d151fn1">Reference is to the visit of King Saud of Saudi

                        <item>He agreed that proper timing in an election year was vital. A
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit on March or
                            early April (I described State’s timing) would probably be early enough
                            before the campaign season, provided the other conditions he suggested
                            were met. He agreed that a visit in December, after the elections, might
                            be somewhat better from the domestic standpoint but did not seem to
                            think that such postponement was overriding.</item>
                        <label>(3)</label>
                        <item>Another essential was that we must be able to point to some concrete
                            accomplishment from the visit, in order to turn aside any Saud-type
                            reaction. It would look like a domestic defeat for the President to have
                            received a neutralist with a record of hostility without being able to
                            demonstrate that we got something out of doing so. Mike felt very
                            strongly about this, and I quite agree that we must be able to show that
                            any new relationship with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            is a genuine “two-way street.”</item>
                        <label>(4)</label>
                        <item>Mike wanted advance notice of at least a week before the visit,
                            preferably before it was announced, so that he could lay the necessary
                            groundwork. He thought that if we provided him with a good case, he
                            could soften the adverse impact of the visit through his excellent
                            contacts with leaders of the Jewish community (e.g. the periodic
                            conferences of presidents of major organizations).</item>

                            his opinion such difficulty as arose would come more from sensitive
                            amendments to the aid bill in particular, e.g. denying aid to any
                            country which did not allow freedom of navigation through the Suez

                            reason to accuse State of being dilatory. As for <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>, we have ironed out any

                    <p>King Saud has recovered from his illness and is recuperating from two eye
                        operations performed earlier this month with the hope of improving his
                        eyesight considerably. While the doctors recommend that the King remain
                        convalescent in the United States another two months after his release from
                        the hospital on or about December 30, the King may wish to return to Saudi
                        Arabia shortly thereafter.</p>
                    <p>The King has expressed appreciation for your message sent to him at Dhahran
                        in early November when his illness became known and for the flowers you sent
                        to his hospital room. However, he has become somewhat concerned that the
                        United States Government has not paid more attention to him. Word has
                        reached him through others that the speeches of the chief Saudi delegate to
                        the United Nations, <persName corresp="#p_SA12">Ahmad Shuqairi</persName>,
                        and the negative response the King made to your letter to him of June

                        to do with this.</p>
                    <p>According to confidants of the King, he served notice to Shuqairi four or
                        five months ago that he would tolerate no more anti-American speeches on his
                        part at the United Nations. The King is reported to have said that if it is
                        true that Shuqairi has not heeded his instruction, he will dismiss him. The
                        King has reportedly requested translations be made of Shuqairi’s recent
                        speeches in order to determine for himself.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the King’s response to your letter of June 25, the King is
                        said to have informed confidants last week that he did not draft the letter
                        and did not read it carefully upon affixing his signature. The King appeared
                        to be genuinely disturbed to learn that the letter had displeased you. We
                        should add that Saudi Arabia supported us in the “important question” vote
                        on Chinese representation in the United Nations.</p>

                                    luncheon on a mutually convenient date, and offered to send his

                                        the King’s hope, which he had expressed privately, that
                                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                                        would visit him in the hospital while he was convalescing in
                                        Boston. The Ambassador explained that it was customary in
                                        the Arab world that such a call be paid. In response, U.S.
                                        officials made clear that pressure of work and the illness
                                        of the President’s father prevented him from paying such a
                                        call and that, in any case, such a visit did not conform
                                        with usual U.S. protocol practices. (Ibid.,

                        would inevitably affect his ultimate decision. US does not regard present

                    <p>286. It appears to me that in leaving initiative to <persName corresp="#p_QGAK1">Qassim</persName> we are in grave danger being drawn
                        into costly and politically disastrous situation over Kuwait. As Department

                        cannot long be maintained in Kuwait in face of unrelenting Iraqi pressure.
                        Reliance on British military protection can be no more than desperate last
                        resort. From military, financial and political viewpoints British themselves
                        can hardly view prospect of renewed occupation of Shaikhdom with other than
                        concern. Thought of British troops fighting Arabs on Arab soil with moral
                        and political (if not military) support of US particularly disturbs me as I
                        am sure Afro-Asian world will fail to appreciate distinction which we so

                        independence. Reentry of British would also be politically retrograde step

                        Arab League responsibility for protection Kuwait and would place Jordanians
                        and Saudis in even more invidious position than they now occupy. <persName corresp="#p_QGAK1">Qassim</persName> moreover would be taken off hook of
                        his own making and saved from loss of face in delaying promised action under
                        such circumstances. But how long would British keep garrison in Kuwait, or
                        how often could they afford to send the fire brigade for <persName corresp="#p_QGAK1">Qassim</persName>’s false alarms?</p>
                    <p>Only alternative I can see to this dreary prospect is for Kuwait to become
                        genuine concern of other Arab states, and specifically of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>

                        situation. He can be fairly sure that British will for present keep Kuwait
                        out of <persName corresp="#p_QGAK1">Qassim</persName>’s clutches but will
                        himself be free to castigate them as “Imperialists” for doing so and it is
                        essential in my opinion that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        and other Arab leaders be given real incentive to involve themselves in fate
                        of Kuwait. Too much is at stake politically (future shape and coloration of
                        Arab world), economically (combined oil resources of Iraq and <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0435"/>Kuwait) and psychologically (another

                        Bedouin Shaikhs. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> appears to be
                        key to problem, and it is past time Ruler is told he must find <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s price and pay it if he does not

                        crass bribe will be necessary. His pride and prestige will also have to be
                        engaged if he is to stay interested. A device designed to give him both
                        protective responsibility and some measure of claim on funds for development
                        will have to be found. Similarly Jordan will have to be given tangible
                        inducement to maintain political, and particularly military, commitment to
                        preserving Kuwait’s independence. Whether such arrangements are best worked
                        out in series of bilateral agreements or whether problem better approached

                        which Iraq too could benefit) is question obviously requiring careful study.
                        Ruler of Kuwait must, however, be made to realize that nothing less than
                        major and continuing fin contribution to develop other Arab states
                        (particularly oil have-nots such as Jordan and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>) will in long run save Kuwait from total absorption by one

                    </list>
                    <p>Intense British concern with their large stake in Kuwait and their apparent
                        determination to pursue a policy of firm response to the slightest
                        indication of aggressive Iraqi intentions, led them in the last few days to
                        order an aircraft carrier and small vessels from Kenya to the Persian Gulf
                        area. The British Air Transport Command has been placed in an alert status.
                        By giving these moves plenty of publicity, the British have sought to
                        exercise a deterrent effect on Prime Minister Qasim of Iraq. The
                        intelligence items on which the British acted did not seem to us to indicate
                        any real danger.</p>
                    <p>These British steps may well have had the desired effect in impressing the
                        Iraqis. Other results, however, are not so helpful. Iraq has sent a letter
                        of protest to the President of the United Nations Security Council
                        describing the British moves as an “aggressive, imperialistic” exercise in
                        “gunboat policy”.<note n="1" xml:id="d155fn1">December 28, 1961; <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> doc. S/5043.</note> We have unconfirmed
                        reports of a statement from the Arab League, currently supposed to be the
                        guardian of Kuwait’s security, criticizing the British moves. Unconfirmed
                        press stories report <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-Iraq “secret talks”
                        aimed at “resolving their differences over Kuwait”. Whether or not these
                        reports prove true, they underline the fact that the recent British actions
                        tend to erode the principal political bulwark to Kuwait’s security, namely,
                        Arab League support for Kuwait’s independence. Arab League intentions have
                        been demonstrated by the stationing in Kuwait of some 2,000 troops,
                        principally of the Jordanian and Saudi armies. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> support for the Arab League position on Kuwait has shown
                        some sign of weakening with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s recent
                        withdrawal of its 150-man contingent.</p>
                    <p>We are inclined to believe that it would be extremely difficult for Qasim to
                        launch a surprise attack on Kuwait. However, in public statements he has
                        committed himself over and over again to the “recovery of Kuwait” and there
                        is no doubt that a successful quick conquest would <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0437"/>greatly strengthen his hand in the uneasy
                        internal situation he now faces. He may be tempted also by the impunity with
                        which India seized Goa.</p>
                    <p>Against these advantages and pressures Qasim must measure the strong
                        possibility of a military defeat at British hands and possible open
                        hostilities with the Arab League. Regarding the latter, Qasim may feel that
                        “Arab will not fight Arab” and that there is little real determination
                        behind the League’s intention to defend Kuwait, particularly in view of the
                        recent withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> troops there. Qasim
                        must also be aware that he probably could not occupy Kuwait without
                        seriously disrupting the entire structure of oil production, sales and
                        royalty payments which make Kuwait a valuable prize. Qasim may be playing a
                        cat and mouse game with the British, hoping to wear them (and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> treasury) down by a series of scare gestures
                        which will make it increasingly clear to the rest of the world and the Arabs
                        in particular that Kuwait is, after all, only a British colony.</p>
                    <p>The British have indicated they will not further intensify at present their
                        precautionary measures with regard to Kuwait.</p>
                    <p>I propose to discuss with the British Embassy here some of the considerations
                        set out above and we have asked our Embassies in Kuwait and London to
                        discover the extent to which the British are encouraging the Kuwaitis to
                        maintain Arab League support.<note n="2" xml:id="d155fn2">Telegram 366 to

                        regimes” in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. We have suggested that our Ambassador in
                        Jidda seek an assessment from the Saudi Arabian Government of the present

                    <p>Two other contingencies might, however, have to be dealt with with regard to

                                our estimate of the imminence of an attack and theirs. Should there

                                British requests of the type we received last summer, i.e.,
                                assistance in obtaining permission for overflights of Iran, Turkey

                                be prepared to reaffirm publicly, if it would seem helpful, our
                                acceptance of Kuwait as an independent, sovereign nation. While
                                British determination to defend Kuwait must be clear at all times,
                                we believe that a positive US affirmation of an intention to
                                participate in this defense would be unnecessary and would probably
                                strengthen Iraq’s case for greater Soviet assistance and weaken
                                Kuwait’s posture as an independent Arab country. Thus we should
                                refrain from public military gestures, such as the dispatch of naval
                                vessels in support of the British position. Given substantial
                                evidence of an Iraqi intention to attack, we should be prepared to
                                support fully Security Council consideration of Iraq’s aggressive

                                developed in planning talks in London some understanding as to the

                            are that one might occur at any time. If it does, we face problem of
                            attitude to take toward new regime—I’d say we should be quite
                            forthcoming in effort to counteract Soviet influence and get Iraq back
                            on more neutral keel.</item>

                            Sale of Cotton</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In response to an inquiry from your office regarding the status of the Title
                        I <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 cotton request from the United Arab
                        Republic, I am able to report that it is under consideration among the
                        agencies concerned. The Department believes it is politically important to
                        respond favorably if at all possible. However, the Egyptian request comes at
                        a time when a serious problem of availability has already arisen in
                        connection with earlier requests for cotton from a number of countries, some
                        of them heavily dependent for many years on United States assistance in
                        securing cotton.</p>
                    <p>Because of heavy crop losses from the severe leaf worm infestation of its
                        current cotton crop, the United Arab Republic has requested <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0441"/>350,000 bales of United States Upland
                        cotton of 1 to 1–1/8 inch in length under Title I of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 to meet a shortage of cotton needed for the production
                        of mass-consumption textiles. The United Arab Republic would continue to
                        export its long and extra-long staple cotton but has given assurances that
                        it (1) would refrain from exporting its own medium staple during the current
                        year (other than deliveries on sales made before the extent of the crop
                        damage was understood) and (2) would not export yarn or textiles produced
                        from the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 cotton.</p>
                    <p>There is no question that the United Arab Republic’s economy has suffered a
                        severe loss from the leaf worm infestation. About 35% of the cotton crop was
                        destroyed. Export prospects are down sharply and the loss in export earnings
                        alone is expected to exceed $100 million. In addition, the availability of
                        cotton varieties for local consumption is substantially reduced, posing the
                        alternative of diverting more expensive longer staples from export markets,
                        or causing consumption of textiles by the mass of the people to be reduced.
                        The United Arab Republic’s weak foreign exchange position does not permit it
                        a third alternative of purchasing medium staple cotton from abroad.</p>
                    <p>Although the request is for 350,000 bales, we consider this excessive in
                        relation to domestic needs and believe a much lower figure would be more
                        appropriate; i.e. in the range of 50,000 to 100,000 bales. Anything much
                        less than 100,000 bales might be politically unacceptable to the United Arab
                        Republic, while a larger amount might stimulate export pressures. We would
                        expect to include in any agreement with the United Arab Republic on <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 cotton appropriate limitations on exports
                        of raw cotton and cotton yarns and textiles.</p>
                    <p>We have already informed the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> that the
                        quantity of cotton presently available for Title I programming is entirely
                        committed and that it has not been possible since mid-October to consider
                        additional requests. We have urgent unfilled requirements involving a total
                        of 376,500 bales for Korea, the Republic of China, Morocco, Ethiopia and
                        Bolivia, where for the past several years we have been supplying cotton
                        under Section 402 of the Mutual Security Act. Although the requests of these
                        countries must receive first priority attention, there are also compelling
                        foreign policy reasons for giving favorable consideration to the requests of
                        such other countries as Viet Nam and India, as well as the United Arab
                        Republic, provided normal Title I program criteria are met.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing, the Department of State is pressing for a review of
                        the over-all question of cotton availability from existing stocks for <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 programming during this fiscal year and
                        has recently sent a <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0442"/>letter to the
                        Department of Agriculture (a copy of which is enclosed)<note n="1" xml:id="d157fn1">The attached letter, from Assistant Secretary of State

                            Agriculture Duncan, dated December 20, 1961, noted that there had been a
                            number of requests for cotton under Title I of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 that exceeded Department of Agriculture October
                            1961 estimates of available surplus cotton, and indicated that the most
                            urgent requirements were for South Korea, the Republic of China,
                            Ethiopia, Morocco, and Bolivia. The letter also advised that special
                            consideration should be given to making cotton available to South
                            Vietnam, India, and the United Arab Republic.</note> in this regard.</p>
                    <p>Our consideration of a cotton program for the United Arab Republic has come
                        to the attention of the press, particularly the <hi rend="italic">New York
                            Times.</hi> A correspondent from this newspaper has raised the relevance
                        of such a program to an unconfirmed report he has received that the United
                        Arab Republic is about to barter cotton for two new wings of Soviet jet
                        aircraft. We have no confirmation of this reported barter which has been
                        denied by the United Arab Republic Embassy here. The United Arab Republic
                        has since mid-1961 been severely restricting its cotton exports to the
                        Soviet Bloc and hopes to reorient at least 60% of its exports to Western
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>It may also be of interest that the Department has just received a diplomatic
                        note from the Peruvian Embassy objecting to the possible sale of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 cotton to the United Arab Republic. The
                        Peruvian Government’s concern is that such a sale would enable the United
                        Arab Republic to export larger quantities of cotton. Peru is sensitive about
                        our <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 cotton sales in general but in the
                        case of the United Arab Republic the sensitivity is sharpened by the fact
                        that the two countries export similar types of cotton.</p>
                    <p>This status report brings out various factors and problems which must be
                        considered in the United Arab Republic’s request for Title I cotton, but we
                        hope that, if Title I availability permits, a cotton program for the United
                        Arab Republic can be developed which will be acceptable to all parties
                        concerned.</p>

                    <p>Following reconsideration of the key position of the United Arab Republic in

                        here, we are proposing a program of coordinated steps in our relations with

                        objective would be to encourage orderly economic development in the United
                        Arab Republic with beneficial consequence for Near East area stability, and
                        to provide significant Western alternatives to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> economic, and possibly political, dependence on the
                        Soviet Bloc. We propose no sweeping commitments to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> at the outset and, prior to initiating
                        each step, we would review carefully the nature and extent of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> responses to previous steps.</p>

                        <p>The United Arab Republic’s severe economic plight and its fear of
                            over-involvement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> have
                            led to initiatives to secure more comprehensive U.S. economic
                            assistance. It is clear we have come to another crossroads in our
                            relations with the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regime,
                            similar perhaps to those that confronted us on the arms question in
                            1955, on the High Aswan Dam in 1956 and on the initial request for wheat
                            under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 in 1958. Our purpose is
                            again being tested and how we respond may set the pattern of our
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> for a
                            considerable <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0446"/>time to come.
                            Ironically, we are again in a situation where either a positive or a
                            negative response is fraught with possible dangers. In proposing this
                            program we are aware that the United Arab Republic’s present political
                            posture, its antagonism toward France and the United Kingdom, its
                            seizures of private industry and other property, its attacks on other
                            Arab leaders, its continued (but currently non-activist) hostility
                            toward Israel and its dealings with the Soviet Bloc create an atmosphere
                            which in the short-term inhibits the development of mutual confidence
                            between us. It is not in our interest to condone these policies or to
                            bail the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> out of the difficulties
                            in which it finds itself. Our purposes are principally long-term.</p>
                        <p>In the light of our earlier experiences and to achieve our broad
                            objectives in the Near East, and despite the unhappy policies currently
                            pursued by the U.A.R, we believe a cautiously positive response is
                            indicated. Thus, we have sought to devise a step-by-step plan of action,
                            evaluating results achieved and the over-all atmosphere of our relations
                            before embarking on each successive stage. Our plan is not rigid; its
                            steps can be altered to fit circumstances as we proceed. An essential
                            element is the avoidance of irrevocable commitments.</p>
                        <p>Our general policy toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> has
                            been set forth in a memorandum to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> of November 16, 1961.<note n="3" xml:id="d159fn3"><ref target="#d141">Document 141</ref>.</note> The action
                            program here proposed is consistent with the earlier policy
                            statement.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Objectives</hi></p>
                        <p>An important underlying motive is our desire to capitalize on the
                            opportunity to work in a backward but key geopolitical country which has
                            already adopted many of the reforms sought in the Alliance for Progress.
                            In this context, long-term objectives must be separated from short-term
                            tactical considerations. We do not, of course, seek or expect specific
                            political commitments in return for expanded U.S. interest and
                            assistance. However, by responding to urgent <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> requests we can reasonably expect: <list>

                        <p>There are concrete indications that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> seeks consciously to follow political policies that
                            will enhance its prospects for securing U.S. aid. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s consistently forthright

                            relatively helpful stance at the recent Belgrade Conference is another.
                            During the recent United Nations General Assembly debate on Palestine

                            Casablanca and Monrovia powers has recently been indicated. While
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> publicly inveighs
                            against “reactionary” rulers, at the same time he emphasizes to his
                            people the necessity of concentrating on internal <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> development.</p>
                        <p>We can hope our assistance may exert a subtle influence on the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> internal political structure. Since
                            the Syrian revolt there is evidence that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has been sharing some of his power with former
                            members of the RCC, some of whom, such as Baghdadi and Muhyiddin, lean
                            to the West whereas others lean to the Soviets. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> Ambassador has informed us that
                            current <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> requests originated with
                            Baghdadi, the economic czar. The latter’s position will be strengthened
                            to the extent he succeeds in obtaining Western assistance.</p>
                        <p>On the other side of the ledger we have to recognize that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is not reliable and that his
                            cooperation can only be insured as long as he thinks the stakes are high
                            enough to justify it. Even then unforeseen developments, for example the
                            “Cleopatra” incident, can quickly destroy the good work of many months.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is presently addicted,
                            perhaps incurably, to a radical type of socialism which is inimical to
                            our concepts of free enterprise. Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> believes, on the basis of his recent interview
                            with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, that more exposure
                            to American business methods might tend to moderate <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s doctrinaire attitudes.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> believes that
                            the pragmatic necessity of making his economic program work will temper
                            some of these views. This remains to be seen.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s current obsession over
                            security, his arbitrary arrests and sequestrations and his handling of
                            the French espionage case are not to be condoned. There is a systematic
                            program against foreign minorities who are disliked because of their
                            past dominance of Egyptian business and commerce. Aid for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> —the enemy of Israel and a leading
                            neutral—is not easy to sell to Congress and the U.S. public. In our
                            economic aid we must proceed cautiously to avoid bailing the regime out
                            of the economic consequences of the recent wholesale nationalization and
                            expropriation. U.S. aid must not, of course, be used to enable the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> to purchase arms from the
                            Soviet Bloc.</p>

                        <p>On balance we believe we should seize the opportunity presented us for

                        <p>Aside from maintaining current programs of assistance, we have in mind

                                    agreement (with a provision for annual review) indicating our

                                    about the current level of $120 million annually. Conclusion of
                                    this agreement would be contingent on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> cooperation in providing access to pertinent

                                    for a formal state visit in the spring or fall of 1962 depending
                                    upon your political judgment as to which time would be most
                                    suitable.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In addition, we should keep in mind the need for a financial
                            stabilization program. If the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> is
                            willing to accept a new <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> mission and
                            will undertake to implement its recommendations, the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> may, during the spring of 1962,
                            undertake to work out a stabilization program of $150 million or more,
                            of which upward of $75 million would have to come from non-<gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> sources including the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Other steps such as dispatch of a permanent U.S. Government, private or
                            international economic planning mission, participation in an <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>-financed stabilization program and
                            concerting with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and/or other
                            nations in an organized lending program are dependent upon what emerges
                            from the crucible of exploratory talks, a <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            confrontation, and on the ability of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> to demonstrate to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and other donors its eligibility for such an
                            arrangement. With the exception of possible participation in an <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>-sponsored stabilization program, no new
                            U.S. aid would go to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> until
                            the end of Calendar Year 1962 at the earliest.</p>
                        <p>We believe the multi-year agreement is (a) a means of reaping a political
                            dividend without raising the level of the aid we are able to provide on
                            an annual basis; (b) a modest partial response to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> ’s appeal for closer economic
                            cooperation; (c) genuinely of value to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> planning effort; and (d) from the standpoint of the
                            needs of the Egyptian people, completely justifiable in terms of the
                            basic concepts of the Food for Peace program. We believe it should be
                            concluded prior to an agreement with Israel, for which the Israelis are
                            pressing.</p>
                        <p>We believe the proposed exploratory talks by an economic consultant are
                            desirable (a) as an indication that we take the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> professions <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0449"/>of a desire to cooperate seriously; (b) as a means for testing <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> intentions; and (c) in order to come
                            to grips with the problems involved in a more comprehensive economic
                            association, should it at some later time appear desirable.</p>
                        <p>We believe the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit is
                            desirable (a) to provide an opportunity for a personal confrontation
                            with you; (b) to educate <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            about the U.S. and the West generally (he has never visited a Western
                            country except for his 1960 United Nations General Assembly appearance);
                            and (c) to overcome his sense of ostracism which we believe has
                            adversely affected his attitude toward the U.S.</p>
                        <p>We are mindful of the possibility of these steps appearing to be an
                            endorsement of the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regime,
                            but believe the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> itself will seek
                            to play down any public suggestion of closer ties with the U.S. Any
                            concrete development, such as actual signature of the multi-year
                            agreement or announcement of a <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit would presumably not take place for some
                            months yet, hopefully after the current dust kicked up by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s internal measures has settled.
                            And there is reason to hope that taking these steps might cause him to
                            settle the dust faster than he otherwise might. We are not in a position
                            to judge the effects of domestic U.S. reaction and we are mindful that,
                            from a foreign policy standpoint, there are calculated risks involved.
                            We nevertheless feel that action on these lines would be desirable in
                            considering all circumstances.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>We have had a number of appeals by the United Arab Republic Ambassador,
                            acting, he asserts, on instructions from President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, for closer cooperation with the
                            United States in the economic field. These approaches have been set in a
                            clearly identifiable political context.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of these requests we called Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> back to Washington and worked
                            out with him a step-by-step program designed <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0450"/>to strengthen our position in the United Arab Republic,
                            each step to be carefully reviewed prior to its being undertaken.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> agreed that an
                            appropriate beginning would be to offer <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> exploratory conversations looking to conclusion
                            of the three-year Public Law 480 food sales program urgently requested
                            by the United Arab Republic. It was also agreed the Ambassador would
                            discuss the possibility of your appointing a special consultant on
                            economic planning to join with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> in preliminary talks aimed at delineating such
                            areas of economic planning assistance and economic cooperation as might
                            be practicable and constructive in terms of United States-United Arab
                            Republic interests. In a separate paper we will propose Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Edward Mason</persName> of Harvard University as
                            the candidate for this task. The Agency for International Development
                            has suggested that it might be well to obtain Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName>’s approval in principle to
                            undertake the task before the message is sent since it is difficult to
                            obtain the services of consultants of the caliber required.</p>
                        <p>In order to strengthen our Ambassador’s position in the United Arab
                            Republic, to lend added weight to this approach, and as an opportunity
                            to further develop your relationship with President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, we propose that you authorize
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> to deliver to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> the letter

                            who has been consulting in Washington on matters affecting relations

                            program in the United Arab Republic. Recognizing the importance of
                            economic cooperation to improved living standards, the fostering of
                            political stability and as a factor in promoting good relations between
                            us, we have constantly sought to give sympathetic attention to the needs
                            of your country.</p>
                        <p>“Recently your Ambassador in Washington has discussed with a number of
                            United States officials possible means for developing the United States
                            contribution to the United Arab Republic’s programs for economic
                            planning and economic growth. We asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> to return to Washington to aid
                            us in understanding the objectives you have in mind. A number of
                            possibilities were reviewed.</p>
                        <p>“It is a matter of great personal satisfaction to me that we have now
                            instructed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> to
                            inform you that he is authorized to commence detailed discussions with
                            your Government regarding conclusion of a multi-year agreement for sales
                            of food grains to the Government of the United Arab Republic by the
                            Government of the United States. It is my deep hope that the negotiation
                            and implementation of such an agreement will engender an exchange of
                            information and ideas beneficial to concepts of cooperation between our
                            two countries.</p>
                        <p>“I am aware of the interest of your Government in further intensive study
                            of the problems of economic planning, economic development and trade.
                            Should you wish to explore these matters in further detail with us, I
                            should be happy to seek the services of a well-qualified consultant in
                            economic planning to join with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> in discussing them with you and appropriate
                            members of your Government.</p>
                        <p>“Let me reiterate, Mr. President, my sustained interest in strengthening
                            relations between our countries and my hope for continued close official
                            and personal contacts between our peoples and governments. Ambassador

                            confidence, is prepared to convey to me whatever thoughts you may have

                            United Arab Republic.</p>
                        <p>The United Arab Republic Ambassador has had conversations with Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> (then of the White
                            House staff), Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Eugene
                                Black</persName> of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
                            Development regarding the United Arab Republic’s desire for high-level
                            planning assistance in its economic development. The Ambassador later
                            indicated that a United States planning mission of two to six persons
                            would be desirable, emphasizing, however, that the quality of the
                            planners would be more important than the quantity and that it was
                            important to have only individuals of the most outstanding
                            qualifications.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>, who has been
                            here on consultation, believes that the present Egyptian concept of the
                            role of such planners, their access to information pertinent to their
                            work, and their terms of reference may leave something to be desired. He
                            urged that as a preliminary step an eminent planning consultant go to
                            the United Arab Republic in early February, or if more convenient in
                            January, to discuss with United Arab Republic officials and ultimately
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> the United
                            Arab Republic’s economic development plan, the problem areas in the
                            United Arab Republic planning and economy, the role that a United States
                            planning group might play, the prerequisites for effective collaboration
                            with the United States in the economic field, and the facts of life
                            about a consortium approach to the United Arab Republic problem. He
                            would also make recommendations to us.</p>
                        <p>The name of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Edward Mason</persName> of
                            Harvard, who is well known to you, has been proposed by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> as an excellent choice for such
                            a mission, which need not last more than two weeks. It is believed,
                            however, on the basis of several recent rejections by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName> of consulting assignments, that
                            he would accept only if asked to do so by you. Moreover his prestige and
                            influence would be greatly enhanced if it were made known to the United
                            Arab Republic that he is your personal choice for this task.</p>

                        <p>I should be most grateful therefore if you could ask Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName>, who can be reached by telephone
                            at University 8–7600 in Cambridge or by mail at Littauer, Harvard
                            University, to undertake this mission. If he accepts, the Department
                            would, of course, provide an appropriate briefing prior to his
                            departure.</p>

                            of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> to visit the U.S. has been
                            frequently discussed within the government through the years. Rumors
                            have appeared in the press and hints have been thrown out to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> by various visitors, latterly
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>, that such an
                            invitation might soon be forthcoming. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> himself is believed keenly aware that throughout

                            visiting this country. We think it desirable that we reach a decision

                            are a number of favorable and unfavorable factors which I itemize as

                        <p>On balance we are inclined to believe that the favorable factors which
                            may bring long-term benefits, outweigh the unfavorable factors, many of

                        <p>In view of the domestic criticism that is certain to be aroused by the
                            visit, we believe it is essential to avoid conflict with the 1962
                            Congressional election campaign and tentatively have been thinking of an
                            invitation in February (after the conclusion of the French spy trials)
                            for a visit in April, 1962. This would depend upon your judgment as to
                            the latest time in the spring that the visit could take place without
                            complicating the domestic political situation. Alternatively the visit
                            might occur after the elections in November. As the timing of an
                            invitation and of the visit itself must be coordinated with other moves,
                            it would be helpful if you would inform the Department of your
                            views.</p>

                    <p>Then reviewed current US aid under categories indicating that total aid

                    <p>On my inquiry as to how President saw economic situation and relation US aid
                        to it, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> took off on detailed
                        exposition of lack of progress in rural economy and urgency accelerating
                        agricultural productivity. He noted that <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                        recommended twenty-five percent cutback development plan but claimed this
                        impossible because predicted population increase necessitated expansion

                        Washington enthusiasm generated more by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> than by President. Neither <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> nor I mentioned consortium or any
                        other details US or international assistance. I indicated that future aid

                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s response that such
                        agreement mutually useful and appropriate and that he would direct
                            <persName>Kamel Eddin Hussein</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3">Vice President of the United Arab Republic and Minister of Public

                    <p>I then passed to general discussion current atmosphere in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> expressing concern for apparent growing
                        isolation of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> from Arab world and idee
                        fixe of Western imperialist plots. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> spiritedly responded that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> indeed feeling isolated but this due intemperate attacks
                        from Arab neighbors on regime and Arab socialism. He cited Saudi, Yemeni,
                        Jordanian attacks and said that while <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        never begins attack, would always respond in kind. Seemed especially
                        irritated by accusations Arab socialism anti-Islamic and economically
                        unfeasible. On Western imperialist plots to encircle or overthrow regime,
                        President cited French spy case stating that taped recordings completely
                        proved French plot first to stir up commonality and failing this, to
                        assassinate President. I recapitulated conversations with Muheddin<note n="4" xml:id="d161fn4">Zakaria Muhieddin, Vice President of the United
                            Arab Republic and Minister of the Interior.</note> on this topic
                        emphasizing our concern for general principles diplomatic behavior and fear
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would further strain Western
                        relations to own hurt. This formed occasion to state role played by
                        relations with our allies with emphasis that only under aegis effective
                        Western power could non-alignment exist. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> acknowledged our attitude conveyed to him by Muheddin
                        but re-emphasized certainty French guilt. In my judgment, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> sincerely believes his version
                        affair probably on basis presentation made by own security subordinates.
                        President then passed to Lebanon attempted coup for which he chiefly blames
                        Jordan and British. He cited King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>’s continuing support of Syrian National Party
                        through supplying funds, accusing <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> of being involved in both Syrian separation and
                        Lebanon coup. Much of this he blames on British as power behind Jordanian
                        foreign policy. No mention made of US involvement except to note that some
                        American support for Syrian nationalists through Nuri Said in 1957. I stated
                        categorically that USA not involved in any plotting against Middle East
                        regimes and had nothing to do with Lebanon event.</p>
                    <p>Re Arab socialism, I noted that US press reaction had been moderate on whole
                        with criticism arising less from ideological distastes for system than from
                        doubts as to economic viability and distaste for property seizures. On my
                        inquiry as to government intention re sequestrated property, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said that sequestration undertaken
                        suddenly in response <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0459"/>to success
                        reactionary class in Syrian separation and no plan or decision yet taken as
                        to return property or payment compensation. This confirms my earlier
                        judgment that sequestration mainly pragmatic policy whose outcome as yet
                        unpredictable. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> volunteered
                        statement that no truth whatever in Alexandria Russian submarine base rumor

                        time. To my reference to military costs in general and recent Soviet arms
                        purchases in particular, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said
                        that current armed forces budget 117 million pounds annually and new arms
                        did not cost very much. He did not indicate whether recent arms delivery
                        were under a new arms deal or fulfilling existing agreement. He added that
                        he did not believe arms expenditure would seriously affect <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> developmental ability.</p>
                    <p>In closing President stated that he thought relations with USA showed steady
                        improvement and contrasted current mild newspaper treatment with hostility

                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> showed obvious and continued
                        sensitivity to Western and Arab criticism of Arab socialism to which he
                        ascribed political motives rather than economic judgment. Impressed me as
                        feeling hemmed in by unfriendly and hostile surrounding forces against which
                        he is determined to fight back vigorously. While evincing enthusiasm for his
                        economic program difficult to evoke diffusion of detailed economic problems
                        except in context of outside political pressure and hostility. Apparent to
                        me that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s basic concern is
                        political survival of regime which he links indissolubly with Arab socialism

                                coup attempt was so foolhardy and surprising many Lebanese leaped to

                                in an Arab country; and B) was facilitated by fact that following

                                has been much talk of some sort of fertile crescent arrangement, a

                                or Palestinians. Referring to report that 90 Turkish “Commandos”

                            visit, etc.). State is sending over new letter to replace draft JFK

                        February.</p>
                    <p>In essence, State calls for a cautiously positive response to the recent
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> overtures for greater aid. It has
                        been refined since attached was written to include: (a) telling <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> we agree to a multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 agreement; (b) then sending <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Ed Mason</persName> for a quick planning consultation
                        (your personal intercession seems needed to get Ed); (c) sending <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> to Cairo 13–15 February for a tour
                        d’horizon designed to smell the air; and finally (d) depending largely on
                        results of these preliminaries, an invite for a State visit in April or
                        December. Instead of attached letter to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on economic cooperation, State is now proposing a
                        note from you announcing <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>
                        visit, partly in order to reassure <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>

                    <p>State argues that we’ve come to another crossroads in our relations with
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, similar to that over
                        Aswan Dam. It proposes to seize the perhaps fleeting opportunity created by
                        Egypt’s severe economic plight, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s apparent turning inward after Syrian debacle, and
                        his desire not to become too dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, to open a new chapter in US relations with this key
                        neutralist.</p>
                    <p>Our aim would be to encourage <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> turn inward
                        toward economic development as its primary goal, and to provide <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> with more of a Western alternative
                        to excessive dependence on the Bloc. His current economic difficulties are
                        such that if we don’t help him he may be forced to turn even more to Bloc.
                        Greater reliance on the US would also have some restraining influence on
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policies by creating a vested
                        interest on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s part in good
                        relations with the US.</p>
                    <p>All realize that there are as many risks as well as opportunities in this
                        course. At best we can only expect to pull <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> back toward a more neutral position, and deter him
                        from leaning too far left again. This will only be assured if he thinks the
                        stakes are high enough. Even so, he’ll still buy arms from Bloc because we
                        can’t supply him, and our aid will indirectly help him to do so. Moreover,
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s interests run athwart
                        ours at so many points that periodic frictions are inevitable. But the new
                        policy is based on long-term rather than short-run calculations—that,
                        despite the inevitability of further ups and downs in US-<pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0463"/>Egyptian relations, it is in our long-term
                        interest to encourage Egypt to steer a moderate neutralist course.</p>
                    <p>To protect ourselves, State favors a deliberately cautious and step-by-step
                        approach, without too many commitments (at least in early stages) from which
                        it would later be difficult to withdraw. Actually State would just use aid
                        we’d probably give anyway as trade goods for a political approach.</p>
                    <p>There are three aspects of State proposals which you might wish to discuss
                        with State: <list>

                                and sensitive <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will be
                                just as important as what we give him. Our aim is to take advantage
                                of advent of new Administration to get across to him that we want to
                                let bygones be bygones and re-establish a relationship of mutual
                                confidence more like that before 1955. State paper is weak on
                                all-important niceties required to this end; it is based largely on
                                giving more dough. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>
                                visit will help (if staged right) but you will probably have to bear
                                the main burden of another venture in personal diplomacy. This
                                argues for a <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit
                                early rather than late, while <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> still uncertain and impressionable in the
                                aftermath of Syria. Also any number of things could happen between
                                April and December to upset a later visit. On the other hand,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is anxious for a
                                visit and might be on his good behavior if we kept him dangling.

                                reciprocal gestures (e.g., moderation of anti-US propaganda) to

                                <persName>Mike Feldman</persName> regards such gestures as quite
                                important to enable us to defend what will appear to many as an
                                endorsement of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regime.
                                April or December timing is to put <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit either before or after 1962 campaign
                                season. He also emphasizes the importance of parallel gestures
                                toward Israel. You will want Mike’s own views, but he seems to
                                regard domestic problem as manageable if above conditions are met.
                                I’d argue that increased US leverage with Egypt would help over long
                                term in resolving Arab-Israel dispute (indeed Israelis have hinted
                                that it would help if we could turn <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> inward).</item>

                    <p>But we have to worry about other reactions too. France will be most unhappy,
                        and even <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Turkey may need convincing.
                        Such anti-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>

                        will also need a lot of reassuring as our plans become clearer.</p>
                    <p>Finally, let’s recognize that, even though we’re not giving <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> any more at the outset than some <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 and <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>
                        projects we’ve planned to anyway, we’ll have to get in a lot deeper if the
                        new approach bears fruit. State rightly prefers to avoid further commitments
                        till we see <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> reaction, but the above will
                        be far from satisfying <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> needs. Some $75
                        million might be needed to help out an <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                        stabilization program, and to send a planner will confirm our interest in a

                    <p>In sum, we should try this major experiment in the new Administration’s
                        policy of being more sensible toward the neutralists—recognizing the many
                        pitfalls (we must avoid another Aswan Dam fiasco) and aware that it will be
                        quite expensive without many quick returns, but counting on long-range
                        results.</p>

                    <p>We suggest that if possible you have two discussions with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, the first being a tour d’horizon of
                        our mutual interests and problems in light of the world situation, and the
                        second being an attempt to reach common conclusions.</p>
                    <p>Between the two conversations you might have talks with such people as
                        Baghdadi, Mohieddin, <persName corresp="#p_SA7">Ali Sabri</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d164fn1">Minister for Presidential Affairs.</note> and

                    <p>We believe your visit to Cairo should follow rather than precede our planned
                        offer to explore (without commitment) more comprehensive economic
                        cooperation. We consider it essential that there be no implication of
                        pressure and that your discussions take place in the favorable atmosphere
                        that our offer of economic cooperation should create. Moreover, we think it
                        imperative to make an early response to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> on the economic aspects of our proposed action
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Your meetings with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> might be an
                        appropriate occasion to discuss frankly the question of a state visit.</p>
                    <p>Inasmuch as we are trying to build up Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>’s position, we would suggest he accompany you on your
                        meetings.</p>
                    <p>Bearing in mind that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is highly
                        susceptible to flattery (so long as it seems genuine) but also highly
                        sensitive to criticism, we suggest the tenor of your remarks be such as to
                        draw him toward what we hope he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> do and avoid any
                        direct implication that we’re telling him what he should not do.</p>
                    <p>For that reason, we would suggest avoiding direct discussion of his
                        nationalization and sequestration measures, his handling of the French
                        espionage case, his antagonistic propaganda against the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> or other of his more radical policies.</p>
                    <p>Attached, along with a draft text of a letter from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> to President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regarding your visit<note n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">Not attached but see <ref target="#d176">Document

                        instruction to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>, is
                        an outline of what we would consider the most useful type of dialogue.</p>
                    <p>We believe that in any release here concerning your trip, the stop in Cairo
                        should be mentioned in passing and that in Cairo press conferences should be
                        avoided.</p>

                            <item>Personal situation: President, who seemed relaxed and in good
                                spirits, stressed he had taken office only reluctantly. He is not
                                attached to job, although he is very much devoted to Lebanese
                                independence. In this respect, he mentioned that when he heard
                                plotters were coming to get him he ordered guards not to fire, not
                                wanting to be cause of bloodshed. This was first time guards had
                                disobeyed his orders.</item>

                            <item>Communist tactics: Communists have taken advantage of every crisis
                                in mid-East since Arab-Israel war and were attempting likewise to
                                make most of recent disturbance by sending delegations and messages
                                of congratulations to President. Fortunately mass of well wishers
                                was such that Communists went almost unnoticed. Expressing extreme
                                repugnance for communism, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said confidentially he found even shaking

                            <item>Foreign involvement in plot: President stated on this subject he
                                could as yet neither say “yes” nor “no”. Although he would
                                personally prefer to give negative response, any reply will have to
                                await results investigation. Government has particularly been
                                checking frequent recent travels to other countries by “certain

                                merely being “protocolaire”. He repeatedly emphasized Lebanon’s

                                purposes <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> professes neutrality.
                                In this connection he cited Takla’s good work at Belgrade and at

                    <p>During discussion I handed <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
                        informal paper<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">The text of the note, as
                            transmitted to the Department of State in airgram A–139, January 23,
                            reads as follows: “1. The United States remains Lebanon’s true friend.
                            2. Accusations of Western complicity in the recent coup attempt are
                            obviously being exploited by those who are interested in alienating
                            Lebanon from its most steadfast friends. 3. Lebanon’s friends, who have
                            never failed Lebanon in past times of distress, have every intention of
                            continuing to support Lebanon in the future. 4. The United States, which
                            has admired President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s
                            firm and statesmanlike leadership, continues to have every faith in that
                            leadership.” (Ibid., 611.83A/1–2362)</note> stressing US friendship for
                        Lebanon and admiration for his leadership, pointing out accusation of
                        Western complicity obviously being exploited by those who wish divide us,
                        recalling our past support for Lebanon and reaffirming our intention to
                        pursue like policy in future. President said there had been speculation re
                        US attitude toward plot because US looms so large in Lebanese mind that
                        people could not imagine US would not take some stand. Seen in this
                        perspective, our very silence to some Lebanese seemed strange. President
                        suggested I discuss with <persName corresp="#p_TP2">Takla</persName>
                        possibility some type of declaration re US position which however, would not
                        give grounds for criticism by inimical elements. I will of course discuss
                        this with <persName corresp="#p_TP2">Takla</persName>. My own feeling
                        remains, however, as indicated <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>

                        purpose at this time and I suspect <persName corresp="#p_TP2">Takla</persName> will agree.</p>
                    <p>Re point six, I indicated in my understanding that termination technical
                        assistance program did not rule out occasional US assistance for certain

                        Johnson’s views on continuing the work of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> Special Representative.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he is considerably encouraged as the result of recent
                        informal meetings with Arab delegates in New York who appear to have met on
                        January 15 to determine their common attitude toward continuation of the
                        Special Representative mission. They now believe their governments are
                        disposed to cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> and will
                        not push the issue of <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> reconstitution at

                        Representative’s terms of reference. It is evident that the Arabs are
                        disturbed by references to area economic development in the November 22
                        Special Representative report.<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">See <ref target="#d140">Document 140</ref>.</note> They fear this may be an
                        effort to turn attention away from Paragraph 11 and to place emphasis on
                        resettlement. In this connection, the French representative on the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> has received an inquiry from Paris asking
                        his opinion as to the possibility of omitting mention of Paragraph 11 in the
                        Special Representative’s terms of reference. Such mission would be
                        disturbing to the Arabs and should not be considered.</p>

                            and the Arab host states at both the highest and technical levels.
                            (Circular telegram 1315, January 25; Department of State, Central Files,
                            324.84/1–2562)</note> Dr. Johnson said he is now inclined to play “a
                        little hard to get” to elicit assurances of access.</p>
                    <p>Department officers commented that the proposed <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> notification to
                        governments does not specifically request a reply. (After discussion it was
                        agreed that it would be politic to assume Arab approval of a continuation of
                        the <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss> function and of the <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss>’s access to highest levels unless negative
                        replies are received within the ten days following transmittal of <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName>’s message.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he can continue as Special Representative for one further
                        year only. If by June or July there are signs this work will have to be
                        carried on beyond next fall, thought should be given to his successor.
                        Additionally, he wishes to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> assigned to him for the coming year, with a title
                        appropriate to his responsibilities. As regards a timetable, several
                        questions arise. When the <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss> has accepted
                        appointment by the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> there should be some
                        announcement, for the record, in a very low key. After this announcement
                        there would follow a long period in which hard examination could be given to
                        a series of questions or “studies” directly relating to the <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss>’s second round, to be carried out under the
                        aegis of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>, or perhaps the Special
                        Representative himself, with a competent staff including some
                            non-Americans.<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4">Dr. Johnson said he is
                            interested in obtaining the services of Dr. Bryant M. Wedge, a
                            psychiatrist in Hartford who has shown a real interest in, and an
                            understanding of, the refugee problem, and perhaps also Mrs. Georgiana

                            experience in this problem who is now believed to be on the staff of
                                <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>. Dr. Johnson said that,
                            following a suggestion of the French <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>
                            representative, he intended to call on French officials concerned with
                            the refugee problem during a trip to Europe, in another connection, in
                            February. Perhaps in Paris he might be able to recruit a French expert
                            to help in preparing technical studies. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> Among the matters to be studied would be (a) methods of
                        ascertaining refugee preferences (perhaps by a questionnaire similar to that
                        used in connection with release of refugee blocked accounts), (b) the
                        feasibility of some refugee leaders making an inspection trip to Israel, and
                        (c) the advantages or disadvantages of dealing with refugee movement on a
                        piecemeal basis, country-by-country or camp-by-camp. These studies would
                        serve both to educate the Special Representative and enable him to have in
                        hand a whole series of proposals to fire at the Arabs and Israelis.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Johnson said it seems important to avoid the “numbers game”, aiming
                        instead for limited, parallel movement within prescribed periods.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson said that after completion of extensive technical studies he
                        looked to a second round to begin about mid-April and last four or five
                        weeks. It is better not to try to predict where the problem will stand at
                        completion of the second round.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SRC4">Strong</persName> remarked that the
                        seriousness of our intentions can be questioned if the second round is
                        delayed too long. However, if the states of the area know that studies are
                        going on this will help explain the delay.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he has certain broad questions on which he welcomes the
                        Department’s comments. These are: <list>

                            <item><p>How far is the United States prepared to go in providing
                                    diplomatic support? In this regard, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> had stated on the first
                                    round that Israel is willing to take back some refugees, but
                                    must be “the last not the first”. It seems obvious that things
                                    must be the other way around if progress is to be made, although
                                    the difference between a commitment to take back refugees and
                                    the act of taking them back can be recognized. Israel will
                                    obviously have to be the first country visited on the second
                                    round. Presumably, there will have to be strong U.S. support if
                                    Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>’s view is to be
                                    altered. Support with the Arab governments will also be
                                    necessary, for example, if the <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss>
                                    is to enter refugee camps in safety to obtain indications of
                                    refugee attitudes.</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> commented that
                                    there has been extensive communication between our Government
                                    and both the Arabs and Israelis which illustrates our support of
                                    the refugee initiative. This is “as important a piece of
                                    business” as we have underway anywhere. The degree of U.S.
                                    support provided will, of course, relate to determination of
                                    what is required to get on with the job.</p></item>

                            <item><p>Dr. Johnson noted there are very important financial
                                    considerations in an approach to the refugee problem. There is
                                    the estimate of Mr. Jarvis, the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> property expert, that the value of refugee
                                    property as of 1948 was perhaps 200 million sterling. At the
                                    most, this might mean minimal payments to as many as 125,000
                                    refugee families (500,000 refugees). The 200 million figure
                                    presumably must be adjusted to show some allowance for loss of
                                    intangible property (20%), devaluation of the pound since 1948,
                                    and the absence of any return from property for 13 years. To the
                                    result must be added a minimum figure, perhaps $2,500, to assist
                                    each family in resettlement. Finally, funds for area economic
                                    development to create necessary jobs must be considered. In all,
                                    the financial basis for a meaningful effort to resolve the
                                    refugee problem may exceed $1 billion. Obviously, Israel cannot
                                    pay all of this, although unofficial <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0472"/>statements from Israel diplomats have referred
                                    to the possibility of Israel’s setting up a compensation fund of
                                    $250 million. It will be important for the Special
                                    Representative to have an indication of U.S. Government
                                    willingness to provide financial support to enable him to say in
                                    negotiation that funds to do the job can be counted upon if the
                                    parties agree on specific steps toward a solution.</p>

                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that
                                    the <gloss target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss> mission is in itself a
                                    cardinal element of U.S. policy in the area.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Johnson clarified his question by explaining that the pattern
                                    of U.S. relations in the Near East would have an influence on
                                    the determination as to whether there should be emphasis on
                                    making progress in one particular country. Because of the U.S.
                                    position in Jordan, it would obviously be easy to start there;
                                    Gaza will be the toughest nut to crack.</p>

                                    Even well-disposed states such as Sudan and Tunisia are unlikely

                                    in <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> debates of the Palestine
                                    problem?</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> asked whether
                                    in the long run, if the Arabs feel more isolated, they will be
                                    easier or harder to deal with?</p>
                                <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PFTP1">Plimpton</persName> said
                                    that, thanks to the African direct peace negotiations
                                    resolution, the Arabs certainly realize they will not
                                    necessarily find all Afro-Asians in their camp. However, this
                                    sense of isolation will probably make them frustratingly harder
                                    to deal with.</p>
                                <p>Parenthetically, Dr. Johnson asked whether it would be wise to
                                    have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName>
                                    talk to responsible Jordanian officials. The composition of the
                                    Jordanian Delegation at the last Assembly was very
                                    unsatisfactory in that all delegates save one were refugee
                                    leaders. As a result, the Jordanians were time and again the
                                    most immoderate and unhelpful.</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SRC4">Strong</persName> commented that
                                    the degree to which Jordan can be helpful will depend very much
                                    on what the King feels he can or cannot do in terms of public
                                    opinion.</p></item>

                                <p>Department officers replied that a call for the creation of
                                    resettlement opportunities outside the Near East must be a part
                                    of any program for progress on this problem. It is unwise to be
                                    optimistic in this regard, however, since the same factor which
                                    prevents assimilation of the refugee <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0474"/>in the Middle East—his lack of skills—makes him

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> devoted forty minutes
                        of an hour’s conversation to this subject. He protested in very strong terms
                        the Department’s practice of informing other governments that in accord with
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> resolutions the international
                        community refuses to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and that most
                        governments, accordingly, have located their diplomatic missions in Tel
                        Aviv. His remarks complemented objections voiced by Israel Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Golda Meir</persName> when she summoned
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Walworth Barbour</persName> January 12
                        (cf. Tel Aviv’s telegram No. 348)<note n="1" xml:id="d167fn1">Reference is
                            to telegram 438 from Tel Aviv, January 15. (Ibid., 611.84/1–1562)</note>
                        but differed somewhat in intensity and content. According to <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>, the status of Jerusalem is an issue
                        on which the two <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0475"/>governments had
                        defined their differences many years ago and had tried to accommodate by an
                        elasticity of approach which added up to a modus vivendi. His Government had
                        been under the impression that both sides shared a desire not to “elevate”
                        the problem to an issue. Because this effort has met with considerable
                        success, he said, the Israel Government is distressed by United States
                        initiative in volunteering its views to third governments, most recently in
                        the case of Ethiopia. Does the United States assume, he asked, that it has a
                        United Nations mandate to make the problem an issue of principle? (Note:
                        Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> she had been assured by then Acting
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> on March 9,
                            1959,<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2">See <ref target="frus1958-60v13#pg_151"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                        conversation with much more caution, only hinting that his Government had
                        been led to expect different practices from those pursued with the
                        Ethiopians.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that United States
                        policy has not changed since 1952, when U.S. objections to Israel’s
                        establishing its capital in Jerusalem had been expressed in an
                            Aide-Mémoire.<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3">Dated July 9, 1952; for text,
                            see <ref target="frus1952-54v09p1#pg_960">ibid., 1952–1954, vol. IX,

                            August 4, 1952, p. 181.</note> The juridical position and the United
                        States interpretation of it remain unchanged. He admitted that <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> resolutions, intended only to have a
                        temporary effect pending more permanent settlements, have after the lapse of
                        years produced difficulties and anomalies which would prevail indefinitely.
                        It is difficult to believe, he said, that new governments would not be
                        interested in determining why most diplomatic missions remain in Tel
                        Aviv.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> reiterated his
                        question as to why the U.S. feels it has a mandate to keep people posted on
                        this particular <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> position, describing it
                        as inconsistent with U.S. silence on other <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> resolutions. He referred to a Washington Post report that
                            <persName corresp="#p_AFMAH1">Marshal Amer</persName> of Egypt had
                        suggested that Dutch ships would be denied Suez Canal passage and asked why
                        the United States had not pronounced its views on this statement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that, press
                        comments aside, the United States is just as precise with governments in
                        defining positions on other United Nations resolutions. No government, he
                        said, has any difficulty ascertaining U.S. views on any resolution, and this
                        applies to those on freedom of transit.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that the case of
                        Ethiopia had some special characteristics. It had produced two deviations
                        from what Israel had hoped was United States policy. In the first place,
                        U.S. remarks had not <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0476"/>been solicited
                        and, in the second, U.S. remarks were not expressed as representing its own
                        reasons for maintaining its Embassy in Tel Aviv but as advice to Ethiopia as
                        to how it should decide.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said he could not agree
                        there is any great difference between an expression of U.S. views
                        unsolicited or volunteered. In conversations between officials, a U.S.
                        viewpoint might be expressed in response to an inquiry volunteered for
                        reasons of U.S. interest.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> rejoined that there
                        is a deep, substantive difference. When the United States volunteers a
                        viewpoint, he said, no responsible government would conclude that it is less
                        than serious, urgent, and important.</p>
                    <p>To this Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that the
                        converse is also true.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> introduced other
                        subjects which were discussed for a quarter of an hour, but as he prepared
                        to leave he said he wanted to return once more to the Jerusalem issue,
                        saying he would appreciate assurances by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> that when it appeared other countries are considering
                        where to locate their diplomatic missions in Israel, the United States will
                        not volunteer its views, expressing them only if solicited.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> gave him no encouragement.
                        He said that the problem is a difficult and complex one, and because it has
                        these characteristics he had studied the record of our policy to determine
                        (a) whether our policy had changed since 1952, and (b) on what rationale, if
                        any, would a change be warranted. On a basis of this investigation, he said,
                        he found no evidence of a change or of reason to change. He expressed his
                        general agreement with the position Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> had taken in his conversation with Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>.</p>

                            memorandum of August 7, 1961 regarding the implementation of U.S. policy
                            in Iran as set forth in the Iranian Task Force’s report of May 15, 1961,
                            there is attached a report by the Chairman of the Task Force, Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>, which covers
                            the activities and progress made by the cooperative efforts of the U.S.
                            and Iranian Governments in the intervening period. The report concludes
                            that the appropriate branches of the present Administration have been
                            given sufficient authority to carry out U.S. policy in Iran and that no

                    <p>In the seven months since the initial recommendations of the Iran Task Force
                        were approved, the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> regime has
                        avoided the immediate <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0477"/>political and
                        economic disasters which were then threatening Iran, and has made a cautious
                        start toward carrying out essential social and economic reforms and
                        establishing a political framework more conducive to the emergence of
                        non-extremist leadership.</p>
                    <p>Specifically: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>It has surmounted the immediate political crisis which brought it
                                into office and has fought off extremist pressures from all sides.
                                It has retained the Shah’s support in domestic matters and has
                                supported his pro-Western foreign policy.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>It has taken the first steps to reduce inefficiency and corruption
                                within the government; high-level dishonesty has decreased sharply
                                and dozens of former officials are being tried, punished,
                                investigated, or exposed.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>It has waged an effective but difficult and unpopular fight
                                against inherited problems of inflation and foreign exchange
                                shortages, involving restrictions on imports, bank credit,
                                government spending, and wage increases. It is tooling up for the
                                Third Economic Development Plan, and is widening and accelerating
                                the land reform program.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>These are significant, if limited, gains. They have been achieved through the
                        efforts of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>, the acquiescence or
                        sporadic support of the Shah, and a judicious combination of United States
                        advice, pressure, and financial assistance.</p>
                    <p>These accomplishments have not, however, cured the underlying malady of the
                        country. Iran remains politically sick and economically disorganized, and a
                        synthesis of moderate political forces is not yet in sight. Despite the
                        Shah’s good intentions, patriotism, and intelligence, he remains essentially
                        mystical, vain, and suspicious. As reflected in Annex C some concrete
                        progress has been made but the Shah is either unwilling or unable to take
                        the difficult and, to him, distasteful measures which would enlist the full
                        confidence and enthusiastic support of the majority of his more politically
                        conscious and articulate subjects. At best he can be induced to consent to
                        the efforts of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> or a like-minded
                        successor. At present the political drives of the Mosadeq-oriented
                        “Nationalists” and their immediate following among the <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0478"/>educated and semi-educated are largely
                        destructive and unrealistic, and are directed almost exclusively toward
                        obtaining supreme power as an end in itself. Nor is there in existence or in
                        prospect any effective group which can occupy the middle ground between the
                        Shah on the one hand and the heirs of Mosadeq on the other. With
                        insignificant exceptions the conservative element in Iran is hopelessly
                        short-sighted and is concerned only with its private vested interests. The
                        Iranian military has not produced imaginative political leadership and is
                        not likely to do so.</p>
                    <p>Although there are variants in between, fundamentally, for the foreseeable
                        future, the United States will continue to be faced with the hard choice
                        between two basic strategies: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>To support the National Front as the current embodiment of a
                                revolutionary element which will probably sooner or later come to
                                power. The day may come when the United States could well be forced
                                to this policy as an alternative to chaos or an overt communist
                                takeover of Iran. Were this element to assume power now, however,
                                the almost inevitable result would be the breakup of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, the expulsion of the United
                                States military mission, the loss of Iran as an intelligence base,
                                the denunciation of the Oil Consortium agreement, Soviet economic
                                penetration, and a resurgence of the domestic communist movement
                                which could not be checked by a weak and fragmented power
                                structure.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>To continue to support governments acceptable to the Shah, whose
                                character is such as to make his years as the ultimate repository of
                                power almost certainly numbered. In any fundamental sense the Shah
                                appears unwilling or unable to make the changes necessary to assure
                                the support of the “Nationalists” over the coming decade, if such
                                support is at all possible. His pride, his reputation, and his
                                openly pro-Western attitudes are perhaps insuperable barriers. Heavy
                                pressure by the United States or other friends to force the Shah
                                into a major attempt to compromise with these critics would involve
                                risks of his retiring to Europe or seeking an accommodation with the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, of strengthening the
                                determination of the “Nationalists” to seize power, and of
                                precipitating a conservative coup, thus leading to the developments
                                foreseen in the first strategy alternative.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Faced with these fundamental choices, it is my judgment that United States
                        policies in Iran will be best promoted by continued support of a government
                        acceptable to the Shah, emphasizing in the strongest possible terms at the
                        same time the need to press forward with social and economic reforms. Only
                        by pursuing this course of action can we hope to avoid a major political
                        defeat and concurrently maximize opportunities for a more favorable
                        reshaping of the basic political and economic situation in Iran. This is the
                        basis of our support for the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>
                        Regime and why his program must remain the center of our efforts in <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0479"/>Iran. The test of this policy is
                        whether we have successfully assured, at the lowest political cost, the
                        Shah’s acceptance of the best government in sight (at present the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> Regime) and at the same time found
                        the most effective way to push that government—without shattering it—in
                        directions that could provide cynical and disturbed young Persians with a
                        spark of enthusiasm, hope, and confidence. Every policy decision turns on
                        how we play this game—without overplaying it.</p>
                    <p>Mosadeq-oriented elements will seize on the slightest sign of United States
                        disapproval of the regime to mount massive efforts to undermine and
                        overthrow it. The Shah himself has a breaking point which could mean his
                        abdication and flight, leaving chaos behind him. Relations between the Shah
                        and his Prime Minister are delicate, and could be broken if the Shah were to
                        feel that the United States was supporting a potential threat against him.
                        Ambitious military men and greedy conservatives who are masters of political
                        intrigue will attempt to take advantage of any strain in relations between
                        the United States and the regime. Communist propaganda will exploit every
                        opportunity to convince the public that national sovereignty has been
                        abandoned to a foreign power.</p>
                    <p>Many forceful measures are of dubious value in this brittle situation. What
                        is required is a skillful mixture of enticement and prodding, of periodic
                        involvement and occasional seeming withdrawal, of patience and decisive
                        action. The authority to act must be adequate to the problem. The actions
                        themselves must be shrewdly conceived and flexibly executed.</p>
                    <p>Officials in Washington and our Ambassador in Tehran are functioning
                        according to these dictates. When the day comes that they need more
                        extensive powers than they now possess, these powers will be requested. For
                        the task immediately ahead, the initially approved Task Force
                        recommendations appear still largely adequate. Certain modification in the
                        initial Task Force Recommendations should, however, be noted, as reflected
                        in Annex A to this report. I have concluded, therefore, it is not necessary
                        to request additional authority from the National Security Council at this
                        time. The most effective steps possible to strengthen and broaden the base
                        of the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government and to keep
                        prodding it into forward motion will continue to be taken.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi></p>
                    <p>It has emerged from the Task Force’s deliberations that there is no
                        significant divergence of opinion with the United States Government as
                        regards United States objectives in Iran. To prevent Soviet domination of
                        Iran must be our immediate and overriding objective. This requires the
                        continuance in power of a pro-Western regime, for the most likely ultimate
                        alternative is a weak neutralist government which could not withstand Soviet
                        pressures and maintain Iran’s independence. The pro-Western regime has been
                        maintained and is no longer immediately <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0480"/>endangered, although many longer-term weaknesses remain.
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has succeeded in
                        overcoming a near-crisis situation and thus continuing Iran’s pro-Western
                        alignment. He has, however, been unable fully to pursue his program of
                        vigorous reform measures designed to lead to a more permanent resolution of
                        these basic weaknesses.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister has had to retain the confidence and support of his
                        somewhat reluctant monarch. He has been faced with political pressures from
                        the fanatical Mosadeqist opposition, and with the sniping of ambitious and
                        discontented conservative leaders. The implementation of the vital economic
                        stabilization program has intensified these difficulties by infringing on
                        the interests of various special groups. The basic inadequacy of the
                        administrative tools available to him, which can be improved only slowly,
                        have further limited his freedom of action.</p>
                    <p>The first Iran Task Force Report stressed that the United States should
                        actively and vigorously, albeit discreetly, press for political, economic,
                        social, and institutional reforms in Iran which would provide the
                        indispensable foundation for true and lasting social and economic
                        development. The Third Development Plan which embraces the total economy and
                        takes account of both social and economic requirements is scheduled to begin
                        in September 1962. It must be the primary vehicle to initiate the
                        fundamental political and economic progress needed in Iran. The intervening
                        period will be of critical importance in laying the necessary foundations
                        for the implementation of this Third Plan.</p>
                    <p>In October the Task Force found that additional United States resources,
                        beyond those allocated in accordance with last spring’s Task Force
                        Recommendations, would be required to enable the <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> Government, or a like-minded successor, to surmount
                        the political and economic difficulties which it faced and which it will
                        face between now and the beginning of the Third Plan. Discussions within the
                        Task Force disclosed divergent views as to the means by which the
                        introduction of those resources could best accomplish United States
                        objectives. The possibility was explored of supplementing our continuing
                        diplomatic efforts by developing a package action program with the
                        Government of Iran involving other international sources of economic
                        assistance so that desirable public conditions could be agreed upon for the
                        provision and use of development resources in the context of a joint
                        cooperative and effective effort to solve Iran’s basic economic problems.
                        Alternatively, it was held that the same objectives, given the complexities
                        and fragilities of Iranian society, could best be accomplished by the
                        private and discreet exercise of United States influence and pressure. It
                        was agreed with the Agency for International Development that the provision
                        of the necessary additional assistance, amounting to $15 million in
                        Supporting Assistance and $20 million in development lending, should be made
                            <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0481"/>conditional upon a clear
                        understanding by the Iranian Government that it must undertake seriously
                        certain self-help measures. Our Ambassador has informed the Prime Minister
                        of the additional assistance, and has obtained appropriate assurances from
                        the Iranian Government.</p>
                    <p>A recent and spectacular example of the implementation of the Task Force
                        Recommendations was the finesse with which the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> Ambassadors, working with the Prime
                        Minister, dissuaded the Shah from dumping the Prime Minister or reducing him
                        to puppet status. This course was being urged on the Shah by jealous and
                        apprehensive courtiers, conservative business men, landlords, and
                        reactionary military officers. This effort backfired on its instigators,
                        with the Shah publicly reinforcing his support of the Prime Minister,
                        increasing the powers of the Cabinet, and backing a positive and specific
                        program of reforms. Extremist conservatives are as a result beginning to
                        attack the Shah himself.</p>
                    <p>Our Ambassador in Tehran has recommended that the Shah be invited to the
                        United States on a state visit, in order that His Majesty be informed of the
                        nature of U.S. support for Iran and specifically that he be told of plans
                        for U.S. military assistance for Iran over the next five years. Approval of
                        Country Team Tehran’s recommendations as to the nature of this program was a
                        precondition of the state visit as recommended by the Ambassador; a final
                        decision has not been made and approval of the Country Team’s plan is
                        doubtful. Therefore, and in view of other rapidly changing political
                        factors, I am inclined to believe that the Shah’s visit should follow the
                        successful initiation of the Third Economic Plan, to begin in September,
                        1962. I am consulting with our Ambassador on this problem.</p>
                    <p>Difficult decisions remain in the shaping of the future of the United States
                        military assistance program to Iran and in the preparation of political and
                        military contingency plans for Iran. However, the various aspects of these
                        problems are under consideration in the regular channels of the Government,
                        and no <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> is necessary at this time. (See

                    <p>Guided by the approved recommendations, specific guidance for United States
                        actions in Iran has been drawn up setting forth the goals toward which our
                        assistance, encouragement, pressure, and advice should be directed. (See

                        <p>A joint State-Defense working group has studied the problem intensively
                            and has concluded that the deployment of specifically earmarked forces
                            is not feasible unless and until it is decided that Soviet military
                            aggression against Iran is probable in the near future, and then only if
                            other and overriding military requirements do not prevent such a
                            deployment. The working group has also recommended to me that in the
                            light of assurances already made to Iran and in view of certain dangers
                            which further assurances and specific information as to United States
                            military planning would imply, no such fresh assurances or additional
                            information should be supplied to the Government of Iran at present. I
                            have accepted these recommendations.</p>

                            between the words “encourage” and “the formation”. The immediate
                            situation is such that United States action to stimulate the immediate
                            formation of broadly-based political parties would probably be
                            counterproductive, although we, along with moderate political elements
                            in Iran, recognize the need for action in this direction whenever the
                            situation of the moment will permit it.</p>

                            is in the final stages of a review and modification of the five year
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> plan for Iran. Their tentative
                            recommendation is that the manpower ceiling should be further reduced to
                            150,000 during the Fiscal Year 1963–67 planning period, but with the
                            recognition that, in addition to the bare minimum of military
                            requirements, a certain amount of “sophisticated” material will be
                            needed to make up a package sufficiently attractive to the Shah to gain
                            his approval for a cut in forces. The Shah must be persuaded, however,
                            that great danger lies in internal security and special efforts must be
                            made to meet the high priority requirements for economic and social
                            improvement in Iran. Reduction in forces and military budgets would in
                            themselves be politically popular in Iran and constitute a favorable
                            step in the right direction.</p>

                            military and political contingency planning studies which were set in

                            military attack on Iran in the near future. A relatively low estimate of

                            military planning in Iran covered only United States action against

                                    anti-communist, and has withdrawn to an encouraging extent from
                                    the exposed political position he has occupied in recent years,
                                    and has delegated important powers to his capable Prime
                                    Minister. He has constituted the entire Royal Estates as an
                                    irrevocable religious trust, the profits of which will be
                                    devoted to charity and the financial details of which will be
                                    publicized. The Shah has shown interest in a dynamic internal
                                    reform program, although his interest in technical military
                                    matters is still strong.</item>

                                    officials, particularly in the Justice Ministry, under attack
                                    from rightist forces as being too “moderate”. The National
                                    Front, however, has refused to respond to the Prime Minister’s
                                    invitation to cooperate in a reform program. Distribution of
                                    Crown Estates land is nearing completion, distribution of public
                                    domain land continues, and a new program of model experimental
                                    distribution of private estates is under way. The Prime
                                    Minister, at great cost to his health, continues personally to
                                    solicit the support of all types of non-elite groups through
                                    personal contact and radio addresses. A massive adult literacy
                                    campaign has been launched. Public trials of high officials
                                    accused of corruption in the past have begun, investigations and
                                    the preparation of cases against others continue, and high-level
                                    corruption has been sharply reduced, all within a pattern of
                                    strict legality and the protection of the rights of the
                                    individual. A basic civil service reform statute has been drawn
                                    up and is under consideration by the Cabinet.</item>

                                    Formulation of a Third Plan to capitalize on major investments
                                    made during the Second Plan and to maintain an average 6% growth
                                    rate is moving forward rapidly. The <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> expects to dispatch a team to Iran in January
                                    1962 to prepare a full report on the Third Plan for presentation
                                    to potential members of a financing consortium for the Plan. In
                                    spite of stiff opposition the Prime Minister has enforced an
                                    unpopular stabilization program which includes a sizeable
                                    cutback in credit expansion and the prohibition of luxury
                                    imports. The shake-out in the economy has been severe but most
                                    of the strong enterprises seemed to have survived, the rising
                                    cost-of-living has leveled off, and Iran’s foreign exchange
                                    position is beginning to recover slowly. The Central Bank has
                                    begun to exercise increasingly effective control over the
                                    banking system, and measures to direct capital to productive
                                    investments have been instituted. Public sector expenditures
                                    have been held down and a major public buildings program has
                                    been eliminated from the current budget. In response to United
                                    States prodding, the Prime Minister has given us written
                                    assurances that Iran will develop a consolidated budget for the
                                    coming year. He has also promised to undertake tax reform
                                    measures to improve tax collections <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0487"/>and is examining ways to improve the tax
                                    structure. Cordial relations with Western oil companies have
                                    been maintained, and a number of outstanding technical and
                                    financial problems have been settled amicably in recent talks
                                    with the oil consortium in London. Oil revenue for Iran in 1961
                                    will be approximately 7% ($20 million) over 1960, or a total of
                                    $305 million.</item>

                                    military costs have been held down for the first time in almost
                                    a decade, and manpower increases have likewise been halted.
                                    Plans now under consideration in the United States Government
                                    provide for manpower decreases with a concomitant increase in
                                    military capability through a restructured United States <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Plan. More senior officers are
                                    being retired than promoted, and promotion lists appear to be
                                    based largely on merit rather than influence. Vocational
                                    training in the armed forces continues to be limited by the
                                    availability of funds.</item>

                                    the “Nationalist” opposition continues, and there is little hope
                                    for improvement on either side. Opposition criticism of the
                                    regime continues to be almost entirely irresponsible and
                                    destructive. Recent developments, including publication of proof
                                    obtained by the security forces that a respected National Front
                                    student was a communist, have apparently increased “Nationalist”
                                    awareness of the dangers of Tudeh penetration. The “Nationalist”
                                    opposition force continues however to be intractably bent on the
                                    seizure of power as a primary aim, and the complete lack of
                                    understanding between it and the Shah continues to be a very
                                    dangerous factor. The United States is beginning a new and major
                                    effort in the field to analyze “Nationalist” leadership to
                                    ascertain the feasibility of an attempt to influence it in the
                                    direction of greater responsibility.</item>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">George McGhee</persName> apparently had nothing
                        in mind beyond showing that State has things in <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0489"/>hand. Indeed purpose of report itself is to tell <gloss target="#t_WH1">WH</gloss> to keep its cotton-picking hands off this
                        problem—it says no <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action of any kind is
                        needed. Just leave it to our diplomats, who with flexibility, skill and
                        wisdom, will do all that can be done to save this flea-bitten country.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, this report is a vestigial remnant of the original <gloss target="#t_TF1">TF</gloss> exercise. It was proposed four months ago by
                        me in order to close off <gloss target="#t_TF1">TF</gloss> effort by showing
                        everybody that movement was underway (at that point <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> was urging that Ken<note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2"><persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Kenneth Hansen</persName>,
                            Assistant Director of the Bureau of the Budget and member of the Iran
                            Task Force.</note> and I leave him and <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> alone).</p>
                    <p>Of course I still believe we are going to hell in a hack in Iran, and that
                        our policy is not sufficient unto the need. Nor have I found anybody in
                        State or elsewhere (except perhaps <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> and his staff) who disagrees with first proposition.
                        The desk officer (<persName corresp="#p_BJW3">John Bowling</persName>), just
                        back from Teheran, says that chief disagreement he had with Embassy was
                        their surprisingly optimistic outlook. Note how new report itself reeks with
                        pessimism, pointing out that “the underlying malady of the country” has not
                        been cured. “Iran remains politically sick and economically disorganized …”
                        “The Shah is either unwilling or unable to take the difficult and, to him,
                        distasteful measures which would enlist full confidence and enthusiastic
                        support of … his more politically conscious and articulate subjects.” The
                        National Front “will probably sooner or later come to power.” The Shah’s
                        character “is such as to make his years as the ultimate repository of power
                        almost certainly numbered.” He “appears unwilling or unable to make the
                        changes necessary to assure the support” of the Nationalists. Add all this
                        up and you wonder why we’re not more worried about Iran.</p>
                    <p>The guts of the problem are illustrated on Page 2 of State paper. Are we
                        really confronted with only “the two basic strategies” outlined? Note that
                        way these are phrased makes us appear to be backing a losing
                        proposition—instead of supporting “a revolutionary element which will
                        probably sooner or later come to power” we “continue to support governments
                        acceptable to the Shah whose character is such as to make his years … of
                        power almost certainly numbered.” Put this way we are running a holding
                        action which will sooner or later fail.</p>
                    <p>But there is also a middle course which was that recommended by the Iranian
                            <gloss target="#t_TF1">TF</gloss> and approved by President in the
                        moment of truth during last May’s crisis. It was to back a moderately
                        progressive government in an attempt to take the wind out of the <gloss target="#t_NF1">NF</gloss>’s sails, risking the Shah’s displeasure if
                        necessary but seeking to keep him in line. To say that the Shah won’t let
                        this type of government succeed yet that we must confine ourselves to what
                        the Shah will allow is tantamount to saying that <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0490"/>sooner or later we will have an <gloss target="#t_NF1">NF</gloss> government in Iran with disastrous consequences. Indeed this
                        is what the paper says.</p>
                    <p>If this is so, I don’t quite see the overriding risk in pushing the Shah
                        harder. As Cuyler Young put it, we should have no qualms about
                        “intervention”. He felt we are “damned if we do and damned if we don’t.” And
                        the paper itself agrees. So why not take risk of pushing Shah harder in
                        light of probability of failure if we don’t. This is the core of the
                        long-standing <gloss target="#t_TF1">TF</gloss> divergencies on Iranian
                        policy. Given the pessimistic consensus about the Iranian outlook, <persName corresp="#p_HKR1">Ken Hansen</persName> and I have argued for a much
                        more dynamic effort to avoid the otherwise inevitable result.</p>
                    <p>However, we have given up for the moment butting our heads against the
                        stonewall of State, and of being told that one must accept in the last
                        analysis the Ambassador’s judgment. Had you heard <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> when he was back here last time,
                        describing how he really shared the Shah’s fear of the Afghans and Iraqis
                        and how we must insure Iran’s security as first priority, you would realize
                        that this competent but traditionally-minded diplomat just doesn’t
                        understand the essential nature of the problem we confront in Iran today.
                        The first priority is rather how to accomplish the transition from a feudal
                        regime to a modernized society without such chaos and upheaval as will
                        permit <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to make good on his
                        boast that Iran will fall like a ripe plum into his lap.</p>
                    <p>I argued that <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Phil</persName> should use this
                        report as a vehicle for bringing forward the two immediate issues now
                        confronting this Administration, i.e. how much military baksheesh to give
                        the Shah and whether to have him here for a visit. But these subjects are
                        merely mentioned in passing.</p>
                    <p>As the President put it, an extra $70 million spread over five years isn’t
                        much; but the point is that giving it would symbolize our intent to continue
                        the same half-baked policy as in the last decade,<note n="3" xml:id="d170fn3">A marginal handwritten notation by <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> next to the first three lines of
                            this paragraph reads: “Read Teheran 530, just in, as example of Holmes’
                            latest effort.” In telegram 530 from Tehran, <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> reported on a recent conversation with the Shah
                            (Department of State, Central Files, 661.88/1–1862)</note> which was
                        simply to try and keep things afloat, pandering when necessary to the Shah’s
                        love of military panoply and his fears of external attack. The “$70 million”
                        is important precisely because it is a test of whether we will continue
                        along this road or whether we will at long last make a determined effort to
                        force the Shah to face up to the fact that his real problems are internal,
                        not external, and that if he doesn’t do more about them, his days are indeed
                        “numbered.” Moreover, no one has even looked yet at whether the cool $300
                        million even the Steering Group is willing to waste on <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962/67 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                        for Iran could not be jiggered so as to give Pahlevi enough “glamor”
                        equipment to keep him happy. (Note that average <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0491"/>annual level of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to Iran
                        in the comparable <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956/61 period was $62
                        million; the SG recommends $50 million annually which hardly indicates that
                        we are abandoning Iran militarily.)</p>
                    <p>As to the Shah’s visit, <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> is
                        trying to use this as a lever to force favorable action on his $70 million
                        by saying that we should not invite the Shah if we have to give him bad
                        news. Of course Shah doesn’t even know what <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 62/67 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> we’re
                        contemplating (but <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> argues that
                        the only way we can get Shah to cut his army from 200,000 to 150,000 is to
                        tell him something we have never told a <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                        client before—how much they will get over a full five year period). I agree
                        to the extent that a five year package looks more impressive than just $50
                        million a year.</p>
                    <p>I favor a visit by Shah for quite different reasons—because I feel that only
                        JFK will be able both to tell the Shah the home truths which Ambassador
                        obviously will not and to reassure him (with the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> flair) of our unflagging determination to defend
                        Iran. Moreover, let’s remember that Iran is now preparing its Third
                        Development Plan and that we are committed to support this in a substantial
                        way. My idea would be to tell Shah that we are giving him so much more of
                        what we really think important, i.e. development aid, that he and we will
                        have to take a few risks on the military side. And in the last analysis,
                        Iranian army couldn’t fight its way out of a paper bag anyway, so it is the
                        US which would have to defend him against any substantial attack. Why can’t
                        we reassure him that if he is so threatened, he must (as he will have to
                        anyway) rely on our support?</p>

                    <p>My memorandum to you of January 10, 1962<note n="1" xml:id="d171fn1"><ref target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note> suggested proposals aimed
                        at strengthening our relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> through: 1) meeting aid requests of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> Government (principally negotiation of a
                        multi-year commitment); 2) dispatching an American economic consultant for a
                        brief survey mission; and 3) inviting <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to visit this country.</p>
                    <p>To these proposals should be added a visit to Cairo in mid-February by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Chester Bowles</persName>, in conjunction
                        with his visits to Iran and Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>The primary purposes of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>’
                        visit, as set out in the enclosed draft of a telegram to Embassy Cairo,<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">See <ref target="#d175">Document

                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> is, of course,
                        particularly qualified to essay such a task. We think this is a particularly
                        propitious moment for his undertaking such a mission.</p>
                    <p>In order that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> Government may understand fully the
                        nature of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>’ visit, we have
                        prepared a letter from you to President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">See <ref target="#d176">Document 176</ref>.</note> To avoid addressing two letters to

                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>-U.S. economic matters, leaving
                        these to be taken up by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> before Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>’ visit. However, if you approve a <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit to the U.S., we propose that
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> be authorized to
                        discuss it with him.</p>

                        indicated in my message of January 18 (Embassy telegram 530)<note n="1" xml:id="d172fn1">See <ref target="#d170fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                170</ref>.</note> that without waiting for the separate section on
                        Iran I would send you a letter with regard to the Military Assistance
                        Steering Group’s report.<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">See <ref target="#d169">Document 169</ref>.</note> The section on Iran has just arrived and
                        I am therefore able to address myself to both documents.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the principal faults and weaknesses, as I see them, of the
                        Steering Group’s report lie in the fact that the conclusions give inadequate
                        weight to four factors: 1) Although the key to drastic reduction in military
                        aid without serious political repercussions is to persuade the Shah that
                        U.S. forces will help him in Iran if he gets into difficulties, we know he
                        knows, and the report likewise asserts, that this is not possible. 2) It is
                        the judgment of all of us here that the Shah will not cut his forces from
                        205,000 to 150,000 if offered no more modernization than envisaged in the
                        Steering Group’s recommended level of aid. 3) A further probability is that
                        such a level of aid will impel the Shah to draw more heavily on Iran’s oil
                        revenues for his armed forces—to the detriment of the country’s development
                        programs. 4) There is a further problem involved in talking to the Shah
                        about additional economic aid accompanying reduced military aid in that our
                        own procedures make advance commitments of greater economic aid extremely
                        difficult. The essence of my position, then, is that in the light of these
                        facts alone the adoption of the Steering Group’s recommendations would
                        entail much greater risks than are implied in the Group’s report—greater
                        risks in fact than we can afford to take in this country.</p>
                    <p>In my view the report would in effect undermine the substantial political and
                        financial investment which we have devoted to our Military Assistance
                        Program here in favor of a new approach based on theory and supposed to be
                        sold to the leaders of this country without the substance which might give
                        it a chance of being persuasive. Thus, as we edge toward what might soon be
                        regarded by the Shah as unilateral repudiation of our July 1958 commitment
                        to him, he is to be asked to rely upon U.S. retaliatory power for Iran’s
                        defensive military needs when no specific commitment of this power to Iran
                        in various possible contingencies has been or is likely to be made. The
                        Sixth Fleet can come quickly to <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0494"/>the
                        aid of Greece or Turkey; the Seventh Fleet is a powerful defender of our
                        Asian friends to the South and East. But whence will come effective U.S.
                        military intervention in Iran’s hour of need? The Shah fully comprehends the
                        logic of geography in this respect. The report points out (paragraph 11 of
                        the Annex) that “ … a commitment by the United States to defend Iran has to
                        be believable. Even if it were contained in an ironclad military alliance
                        and territorial guarantee, it is apparent that for some time to come the
                        United States could defend Iran against a determined attack only by the use
                        of air-delivered thermonuclear weapons.” The report states, furthermore,
                        that the increasing U.S. capability to intervene militarily abroad is
                        earmarked for Berlin and possibly Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the increased development assistance which the Iranian
                        Government is to be persuaded to accept in place of military aid, the
                        Steering Group itself confesses that it “has not been able to obtain a clear
                        cut picture of what the long term shape of economic programs is likely to be
                        in many of the subject countries”. It does not seem to me realistic to
                        expect the Iranian Government to find the above approach persuasive, and to
                        say, as the report does, that “the countries themselves should not be
                        allowed to gain the impression that we are any less resolute in our intent
                        to assist them in maintaining their independence nor that their military
                        establishments are being so emasculated as to invite overt aggression or
                        internal revolt” is to indicate unfamiliarity with the natural and to my
                        mind logical reaction of the Iranian leaders in the face of a program such
                        as that recommended by the Steering Group.</p>
                    <p>The report seems totally to disregard the value which our policy and position
                        in the Middle East have derived from our Military Assistance program to
                        Iran. This program has been instrumental in keeping this underdeveloped
                        Moslem state, located on the borders of the Soviet Union, firmly on the side
                        of the Free World in the cold war. The Steering Group report appears to
                        assume that our military aid program for Iran can be radically altered
                        against the desires of the Iranian regime while that regime’s adherence to
                        the United States will remain as strong as ever. I am convinced that the
                        concept held in some quarters that the Shah has no place to turn but to the
                        United States is erroneous. Out of concern for his country’s security and
                        worried by an apparent lessening of U.S. interest in this he might seek some
                        accommodation with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, with the
                        concomitant adjustment of Iranian policy which the Soviets would require. We
                        must not forget that the Shah was on the point of making such an arrangement
                        with the Soviets before. I would ask: is it worth the candle to threaten so
                        directly our political position in this area by adopting recommendations
                        based on theory and unaccompanied, as far as I can see, by careful
                        evaluations of the political risks involved? I would hate to see Iran, by
                        turning to neutralism and accommodation <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0495"/>with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, demonstrate
                        to us that there are points beyond which the needs and desires of an ally
                        cannot be ignored. The catastrophic nature in that event of the consequences
                        to U.S. interests need not be elaborated.</p>
                    <p>I hold no brief for large military establishments in countries such as this
                        and in fact my recommendations on the Military Assistance Program for Iran
                        for the period <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 62–67<note n="3" xml:id="d172fn3"><persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>’
                            recommendations on military assistance for Iran were contained in a
                            letter from <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> of September 13, 1961,
                            that was written in response to a July 25 letter from <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>. Both letters are in Department of State, <gloss target="#t_NEAGTI1">NEA/GTI</gloss> Files: Lot 66 D 173, Task Force
                            on Iran; see Supplement, the compilation on Iran.</note> were designed
                        to achieve a reduction of 50,000 men in the Iranian military establishment.
                        At the same time I believe that the Shah of Iran has legitimate military
                        concerns and that these can be met by us with an outlay of funds which is
                        reasonable in light of the interests at stake here. Moreover, since this
                        program, which I put forward in response to your letter of July 25, 1961,
                        would not in my view impede our vital development assistance program here, I
                        urge one more that it be adopted.</p>
                    <p>I must again, as I did in my telegram number 507,<note n="4" xml:id="d172fn4"><persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> advised Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> in telegram 507 from
                            Tehran, January 10: “I have just read special Steering Group’s report on
                            military assistance to Iran and five other countries and consider it my
                            duty to make you personally aware of my belief that, as regards Iran, it
                            contains serious flaws and weaknesses. On basis my assessment political,
                            economic and military factors here I am convinced that course
                            recommended for Iran would be contrary to US interests here. I shall
                            send more detailed comments as soon as I receive country chapter on
                            Iran. Meanwhile, I urge that decision on report be held in abeyance, and
                            I hope that you will be able to review my letter to you of September 13,
                            1961, as well as <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>s 349 of
                            November 1, 1961 and 445 of December 14, 1961. These contain my views
                            and comments on military aid for Iran, which remain valid.” (Ibid.,
                            Central Files, 788.5/1–1062)</note> register my complete disagreement
                        with the approach whereby $50 million would be envisaged, but not funded,
                        for possible use to supply “glamor” equipment to persuade the Shah to reduce
                        the size of the Iranian military establishment. We do not yet know what
                        these funds would be spent for, assuming they were provided, but the idea of
                        producing the equipment involved as “bait” rather than as part of a
                        coordinated and logical program of modernization reveals a complete lack of
                        understanding of the Shah’s position. The Shah will not reduce his forces
                        except as he can be convinced that we will help him with a meaningful
                        program for the improvement of his military establishment. And here let me
                        point out that it would be wrong to dismiss entirely the possibility of
                        bringing about significant improvements in the Iranian armed forces. Though
                        we admittedly do not receive the same defense returns, dollar for dollar, in
                        Iran as we may get elsewhere, progress is being made. I should point out,
                        furthermore, that my recommendations of September 13 make introduction of
                        the “advanced and sophisticated materiel”, referred to in <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0496"/>paragraph 13 of the report, explicitly
                        contingent upon progress in training and the ability of the Iranians to
                        absorb it.</p>
                    <p>The approach envisaged by the Steering Group would not constitute a
                        recognizable modernization program, nor would the amount of funds involved
                        go far enough toward meeting the Shah’s wishes to convince him that he
                        should reduce his forces. On the contrary, he would most likely reach the
                        conclusion that he must get the equipment he needs either by taking the
                        necessary funds from Iranian resources which would otherwise be devoted to
                        development or by accepting economic aid from the Soviets. Neither of these
                        courses would be in the interests of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the Iran Country Annex, I should say that it suffers from the same
                        basic weakness as the report itself—its conclusion is designed to fit a
                        pre-ordained course, and the excellent reasoning against that course, set
                        forth in the first nine pages of the Annex, is paid little or no heed. One
                        example is the statement in paragraph 12 that “there would be a doubtful
                        return in taking action which would reduce military and raise investment
                        allocations by $130 to $140 million a year if the price for that
                        re-allocation were to be a change in the Shah’s policy or in his
                        determination and courage which would lay Iran, developed or undeveloped,
                        open to Soviet influence”. To this very real possibility the authors of the
                        conclusion apparently attach little credibility or importance.</p>
                    <p>But my main quarrel with the conclusion of the Annex is the erroneous
                        evaluation of the basis of Iran’s present Western orientation. Paragraph 21
                        states that “the political value of such a (modernized military) program in
                        maintaining Iran’s Western orientation is becoming more marginal in relation
                        to the basic internal developments which we can influence better by other
                        means” and paragraph 29 asserts that “the risk of an ultimate change in
                        Iran’s foreign policy is no greater (indeed it is probably smaller) from
                        displeasing the Shah than it is from failure to deal effectively with the
                        forces of change in Iran”. This may be all right from the point of view of
                        detached theory, but anyone who has closely observed Iranian political
                        developments for any period of time knows that the Shah is still the basis
                        of power here, that he is likely to remain so for the period with which our
                        military aid planning is currently concerned, and that it is he, and he
                        alone, who brought Iran into the pro-Western camp and is keeping it there
                        despite the constant pressures from neutralist-minded politicians. Paragraph
                        14 realistically points out that it is not unnatural that a quid pro quo is
                        expected for this, and our interest in preserving the current direction of
                        Iranian foreign policy makes it well worth while for us to “ante up”.</p>
                    <p>As for the “forces of change” to which the Annex apparently attributes urgent
                        capability, it is my view that changes are going to take place here
                        gradually, as we are now witnessing, under the aegis of the Shah, <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0497"/>who has publicly committed himself
                        to a program of economic and social reform. It is to our interest to have
                        the Shah in a position, by his having received or been promised a reasonable
                        amount of what he wants from us, where we can exert effective influence to
                        insure his continuing constructive role in furthering progressive change.
                        How else, indeed, can we better promote the success of the policies we wish
                        to see applied here?</p>
                    <p>I get the impression that the authors of the conclusion believe that the
                        preferable way to seek to maintain our position here is to take action which
                        will seriously displease the Shah but will better enable us to improve the
                        lot of the Iranian people as a whole—“nation-building”. Let them make no
                        mistake about this—the realities of the situation here are such that our
                        position for the period under discussion will depend as much upon the Shah
                        as upon the results of increased development assistance. These results are
                        notably slow to manifest themselves politically here, and certainly to have
                        an effect on the people’s attitude toward foreign policy. Moreover, such of
                        the “forces of change” as are interested in foreign policy are opposed to
                        Iran’s aligning herself in the world power conflict.</p>
                    <p>In the light of the above I strongly disagree with the classification of the
                        military aid program as “activities of secondary importance”. The program is
                        just as important as the development program to the maintenance of our
                        position here, and should be continued at the level I have recommended.</p>
                    <p>I believe that at this point I have addressed myself to the main weaknesses
                        and flaws of the Steering Group’s recommendation. I do not wish to draw out
                        this letter by enumerating various other inconsistencies and oversights of
                        the Steering Group’s report, beyond pointing out that there are some
                        startling discrepancies between the figures quoted in paragraph 67 and
                        elsewhere for past and projected military assistance to Iran, and those
                        which are available to my staff here. A comparison of these figures is set
                        forth in the enclosed tabulation.</p>
                    <p>I have gone on at some length because I am convinced that adoption of the
                        Steering Group’s proposal would constitute a retrograde course. It would
                        seriously hamper and retard the promising economic and social movement
                        forward that has been sponsored by and has the continuing support of the
                        regime here and would thus work against the very objectives that United
                        States policy in Iran seeks to attain. I believe, considering the high
                        stakes involved, that the risks entailed by such a course would be too great
                        and I urge, therefore, that favorable consideration be given to my
                        recommendations on the Military Assistance Program for Iran for the period

                                    <item>Secondary but important is general acceptance of Kuwait as
                                        an independent state, particularly by its Arab
                                        neighbors.</item>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>Obviously these two deterrents are closely interdependent. Without status as
                        an independent Arab nation in good standing, British guarantees of Kuwait
                        would leave it with little but the appearance of a British dependency. Qasim
                        might be tempted to contest British power if he thought he could obtain
                        sympathy or support from his fellow Arabs or others in the Afro-Asian Bloc.
                        Yet lacking the deterrent of British power, Qasim might think it worthwhile
                        to risk the opprobrium and isolation from his Arab neighbors and the rest of
                        the world consequent to riding roughshod over Kuwait’s now widely accepted
                        sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>As to (a), we believe that in two tries the British have gained a better
                        understanding of how and with what probable after effects their strength can
                        be applied.</p>
                    <p>The question remains as to what the US can do to strengthen deterrent (b)
                        above. Surprising progress has been made since the British-Kuwaiti exchange
                        of letters on June 19, 1961; accepted into the Arab League, Kuwait had as of
                        December 31, 1961 secured recognition from over 60 governments while 4
                        diplomatic missions had been established on Kuwaiti soil and Kuwait missions
                        had been established in 3 foreign countries. Since before last June Kuwait
                        had been moving toward independent status through gradually expanding its
                        membership in subsidiary international organizations.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, the key fact about Kuwait for its Arab colleagues (and most
                        important supporters) is its oil resources, considered by many of its
                        neighbors not Kuwaiti but rather as “Arab” wealth. Arab respect for Kuwait’s
                        sovereignty is based on, (a) an aversion to seeing such overwhelming
                        resources accrue entirely to one country, Iraq, thus providing it the basis
                        for a dominant role in Arab affairs, and (b) their hopes that Kuwait may
                        adopt a wealth-sharing program. As noted in the various messages under
                        reference and <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 405 to Kuwait rptd
                        Baghdad 195, Kuwait is now moving cautiously toward satisfying the latter
                        hopes by supplementing earlier private gifts (which whatever their size and
                        extent have failed so far to create for Kuwait an image of benevolence) with
                        a business-like program of development lending.</p>

                    <p>Jan. 24, 1962</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>“In the past year I have found that a major problem in understanding more
                        clearly the conviction and preoccupations of our friends abroad has been the
                        lack of close enough contact with other chiefs of state.</p>
                    <p>“It is a truism that the world is changing at an extraordinary rate of speed.
                        This year and this decade are crucial to all of us as few have been
                        throughout history. I know you share my belief that we must do everything
                        within our power to improve the prospects for peace in every corner of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>“My good friend and advisor, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Chester
                            Bowles</persName>, is scheduled to take a trip to the Middle East and
                        Africa. I should, therefore, like to ask him to discuss frankly with you on
                        my behalf the whole range of the complex global issues which today trouble
                        our world. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> could
                        stop for several days in Cairo in February for <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0504"/>such a discussion with you. He would arrive on February 13
                        if this date would be convenient.</p>
                    <p>“As you may know, I recently appointed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> as my Special Representative and Advisor on all
                        aspects of US relations with Asia, Africa and Latin America. He has had a
                        wide range of experience in the economic and political affairs of these
                        parts of the world. He also has a thorough understanding of and sympathy
                        with the manifold problems of the countries earnestly seeking to accelerate
                        their own processes of national self-development.</p>
                    <p>“His stop in Cairo would be announced as an opportunity for him to visit the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to obtain a first-hand impression of
                        conditions in modern Egypt. However, the real purpose of his visit to Cairo
                        would be for him to meet with you. I hope that you would speak as frankly to
                        him as you would to me about the questions which affect relations between
                        our two nations, the Middle East in general, and the whole range of
                        international affairs. He would be able to convey to you my views on all
                        these questions.</p>
                    <p>“I have asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> to
                        bring you this letter and to inform you of further details concerning Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>’ planned trip should you
                        desire them. I should be most grateful for your reaction to my suggestion

                        you, time would be available for the discussions which might prove most
                        valuable to us both.</p>

                    <p>884. For Ambassador. We have concluded that consideration of timing requires
                        we proceed urgently on two aspects of action program discussed with you,
                        namely: (1) consideration of multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 agreement, and (2) dispatch of economic planning consultant.
                        An addition to program is high-level political talks with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> by you and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1271).<note n="1" xml:id="d178fn1">Circular telegram

                        economic consultant.</p>
                    <p>In introducing multi-year agreement you should state USG’s satisfaction with
                        relative improvement US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations
                        attending expanded economic cooperation of past three years and confirm our
                            <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0506"/>interest in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s sound economic development. Upon being
                        approached by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        regarding comprehensive assistance, we sought concrete step from which to
                        make beginning. Multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 arrangement
                        would be ideal start of what we hope would be a step-by-step development of
                        our relations.</p>
                    <p>We recognize, however, that multi-year agreement, important as it is, is not
                        whole answer to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s long-range economic
                        problems. In order come to grips with many complex issues involved and to
                        open way for possible consideration further areas cooperation, President is
                        prepared provide services of highly-qualified economic consultant who would
                        visit <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> for approximately two-week period.
                        In view fact consultants of caliber required are heavily engaged, some delay
                        in arrival inevitable. Worth waiting a bit to have right man.</p>
                    <p>Vital to success of both multi-year proposal and visit of consultant that
                        talks proceed in atmosphere of absolute frankness. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should clarify areas where US cooperation would be useful.
                        Similarly we expect instruct our consultant to be utterly frank and
                        objective in expressing to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> his views as
                        to what steps, facilities, access to economic information, and above all,
                        degree of mutual confidence required. Only through such candid discussions
                        can we assess <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> needs against US
                        capabilities. Demands on latter are, of course, steadily increasing as
                        larger number developing nations look to US for help.</p>
                    <p>Thus, you should stress to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that
                        quick or dramatic results cannot be expected. Essential to proceed
                        gradually, taking each step with eyes fully open and cards on table. We seek
                        neither privileged position, political domination, nor irrevocable
                        commitments. We believe foregoing demonstrates depth US interest in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and should serve allay any feeling of
                        isolation or insecurity which Western policies alleged to create.</p>

                                were less concerned about strong domestic reaction than about

                                wouldn’t add up to anything, so be regarded as a New Frontier

                    <p>I heard conflicting reports about the President’s attitude. State apparently
                        heard that he was not very enthusiastic about <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> gambit and said he would go ahead with visit only on
                        strong State recommendation and would hold State responsible if anything
                        went wrong. State office director, at least, was much shaken by this,
                        because any number of things could go wrong (for example, <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> visit leaked to press on Thursday,
                        thus diluting impact we planned). On other hand, <persName corresp="#p_KC2">Carl</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d179fn3"><persName corresp="#p_KC2">Carl Kaysen</persName>.</note> assured me that JFK had not yet made

                                Series, Iran, 8/1/61– 8/14/61)</note></item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The Department recommends that the Shah of Iran be invited to the United
                        States for a state visit this autumn. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> feels that an invitation is essential to bolster the
                        Shah’s morale and confidence in Western support against Soviet threats and
                        subversive pressures. The internal stability of Iran, as well as its foreign
                        policy, is for the present and the near future almost entirely dependent
                        upon the resolution, courage, and common sense of the Shah. He is under
                        heavy domestic and foreign pressure to abandon his openly pro-Western
                        stance.</p>
                    <p>The Shah has let it be known that he desires an invitation, and the coming
                        visit of the Special Representative of the President, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>, to Tehran affords an excellent
                        opportunity to extend the invitation under the best possible circumstances.
                        The Department suggests that a letter of invitation from the President be
                        handed to the Shah by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> on his forthcoming visit to Tehran. The Department
                        understands that the period September 25–October 4 is open on the White
                        House schedule.</p>
                    <p>No negotiations are contemplated during the visit. The issue of greatest
                        importance to the Shah is the level of United States military assistance to
                        Iran. This matter will have been settled by the suggested time of the visit.
                        Furthermore, the Third Development Plan of Iran will have been launched by
                        late September, thus providing recent and concrete evidence of the Shah’s
                        role as a forward-looking leader of his people.</p>
                    <p>A state visit, rather than a more informal one, is necessary because the Shah
                        personally likes pomp and because President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, his deadly personal enemy, is scheduled for a state
                        visit; any lesser treatment of the Shah would appear to him and his people
                        as a personal insult.</p>

                    <p>Attached is the suggested text of a letter from the President to the Shah, to
                        be delivered to the Shah by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">The text of the letter
                            reads in part: “I have long observed the role you have played in leading

                            unity, and the preservation of the independence and integrity of your

                    <p>In brief, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> seems convinced that the

                        have decided to restore their grip on the Near East, to isolate the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>, to involve the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> in a military conflict with Israel, and to cause the
                        disappearance of the present <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>
                        Government as an aftermath of defeat by Israel. In <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0513"/>response to the pressures it senses the

                        greater military strength despite economic stringency. The Soviets are
                        exploiting this to the maximum.</p>

                        <p>A number of factors can be identified which tend consistently to have a
                            negative effect on any efforts to develop and strengthen US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s Own
                                Policies</hi> contribute significantly to these difficulties
                            frequently because the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> may be
                            engaged, as at present, in endeavoring to cultivate relations with the
                            U.S. while attempting, at the same time, to secure certain of its
                            requirements from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Thus,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> recently received
                            Soviet naval and economic missions. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> of January 6 reflects Soviet willingness to renew
                            efforts for closer Soviet-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations.
                            At the same time the Soviets foster <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            fears of supposed Western attempts at “encirclement” or isolation of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. In general, an acceleration in
                                Soviet-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> contacts is probably seen
                            by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as a means of speeding
                            up implementation of the Soviet industrialization loan of 1958, as a way
                            of expediting construction of the Aswan High Dam, and as confirming the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s only reliable source of arms.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> probably seeks
                            benefits from arousing U.S. concern at the prospect of closer <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            relations. For internal political reasons, as well as to convince the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and neutrals of the purity of
                            its “anti-imperialist” <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0514"/>policy,
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has recently created public rows
                            with both France and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Israel and France</hi> have thus been stimulated to
                            undertake an anti-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> campaign. French
                            indignation at the Cairo “spy trials” has led to violent anti-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> press campaigns not only in France but
                            throughout Europe, and to negative French and Israeli reaction to U.S.
                            aid to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. For example, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> request for cotton under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 to meet domestic deficiencies was
                            interpreted by Israel as permitting the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to use more of its own cotton to purchase Soviet arms.
                            This line has appeared in the U.S. press and has helped persuade U.S.
                            opinion of an important new Soviet-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            arms deal. This was further amplified by reports, vigorously denied by
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> government, of establishment of
                            a Soviet naval base in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. (We do
                            not believe <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has given the
                            Soviets this privilege; Soviet arms now arriving in increased quantities
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> were ordered over a year ago.
                            We have turned down the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> cotton
                            request and in fact we believe the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            is anxious to prevent Soviet domination of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> cotton trade.) French counter-measures against the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> have included recent efforts to
                            block additional <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> drawings from the
                            International Monetary Fund and efforts to cut down on lines of credit
                            available to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> from European
                            banks. The French clandestine radio, “The Voice of Free Men,” habitually
                            attacks U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> cooperation, and its
                            out-put of this type has recently been stepped up.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s Alleged
                                Intent to Block the Suez Canal</hi> has been widely disseminated in
                            connection with Portuguese vessels allegedly wishing to assist Goa or
                            Dutch warships bound for West Irian. These statements appear to have

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Conclusion:</hi> Such cross-currents are familiar to

                            considerable period of time. They tend to follow typical patterns. While
                            a good deal of the responsibility lies with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policies themselves, as well as with Israeli, French
                            and Soviet maneuvers, we believe we should not be deflected from our own
                            objective of developing with patience and tenacity a stronger position
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. At present, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> badly needs our help and has already
                            modified certain policies to get it (putting Israel in the “icebox,”
                            reducing its ties with the Soviet Bloc, a more moderate line in Africa).
                            The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> greatly fears over-involvement
                            with the Soviets since fundamental to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s philosophy is a desire to remain free of
                            foreign domination, Eastern or Western. We should pursue existing

                        <item>Iraq’s Prime Minister Qasim has proved more durable than appeared
                            likely a few years ago, but his position still depends more on the
                            ineffectiveness and mutual antagonisms of his opponents than on his own
                            strength. No attempt to displace Qasim is likely to succeed without
                            substantial military support. Although we cannot identify any particular
                            individuals or groups likely to bring off a successful coup, plotting is
                            endemic in military circles and assassination is an ever-present
                            possibility. The present state of affairs could drift on awaiting a
                            development which would focus the present generalized discontent.
                            (Paras. 8–9, 11–12)</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>We believe the Iraqi economy will continue in its present sluggish
                            state for the next year or so. Loss of oil revenues, which account for
                            more than half the government’s income, would cause economic
                            difficulties, stimulate discontent, and increase the chances of a move
                            against Qasim. We believe, however, that Qasim designed the recent oil
                            legislation to take the maximum territory from the oil companies short
                            of pushing them to cease production. Indications are that the companies
                            will continue to produce at their present rate but will forego planned
                            expansion. (Paras. 13–16)</item>

                        <item>Qasim will almost certainly continue to make oratorical threats to
                            seize Kuwait, particularly in view of the domestic and regional benefits
                            to be gained from harassing the British. We do not believe he will
                            resort to force as long as he remains convinced that the British are
                            determined to defend Kuwait and that his troops would have to face the
                            prospect of a fight with other Arab forces. (Paras. 22–23)</item>

                        <item>The Soviets will strive to maneuver Qasim into increasing dependence
                            on them through continuance of a large military and economic aid
                            program, and will continue to support his “anti-imperialist” moves.
                            Nevertheless, neither Qasim nor the Soviets fully trust each other, and
                            the Iraqi Communists are neither influential in the government nor
                            popular in the country. Relations with the West are likely to be further
                            strained by such things as Qasim’s pressures on Iraq Petroleum Company
                                (<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>) and Kuwait. Iraq is likely to
                            continue in its presently isolated position in respect of its neighbors,
                            the other Arab states and the neutrals. (Paras. 17–21)</item>

                    <p>I have passed on to <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Phil Talbot</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> office our feeling that,
                        in view of the President’s obvious concern over the implications of a
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit, it would be better
                        not to press it at the moment. Rather than force the issue on this major
                        foreign policy initiative and risk a turndown, it might be wiser to see how
                        the initial overtures to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> (e.g.
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 offer, agreement to provide a
                        planner, <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>’ visit) come out. If
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reception is
                        sufficiently positive, we then have better grounds for justifying a
                        Presidential invite. Note that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reception of JFK letter announcing <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>’ visit and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 offer was most cordial.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> is in complete accord. He had
                        already assured <persName>Mike Feldman</persName> that proposals for
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit were only tentative
                        and that we would wait and see how earlier overtures came out before making
                        any <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0517"/>firm decision. However,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Phil</persName> feels that he must come
                        forward with a recommendation that we reserve space on President’s calendar
                        for an April visit because once we get to point of decision there will be
                        very little time left to make proper arrangements (Protocol requires at
                        least three weeks). So <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Phil</persName> feels he
                        must have all the staff work ready (we can of course sit on it when it comes
                        over, if time not ripe).</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>, however, would dearly love to
                        discuss the visit when he sees <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. One idea he has is to raise the topic as a “personal”
                        idea with the idea of getting <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        to realize the problems which a visit would create for both sides.
                        Alternatively, if <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>’ reaction
                        during his first talk with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> (14
                        February) were favorable, he would cable back recommendation for visit in
                        hopes he could extend invite during second talk (17 February). I am sure
                        that <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> will want to discuss
                        above with JFK when he sees him early next week.<note n="1" xml:id="d184fn1"><persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> met with President

                            p.m. on Tuesday, February 6. (Ibid., President’s Appointment Books) No
                            record of the conversation has been found.</note> To me, both options
                        are worth considering. But above all I hope that <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> pushing of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit will not give it kiss of death. Therefore, if
                        you think time not ripe, let’s be sure to clue <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> not even to raise issue with JFK.</p>
                    <p>As to discussion with President of whole Egypt problem I infer that you
                        prefer to hold this off until after more returns are in. Amen.</p>

                    <p>In the past several weeks we have tried unsuccessfully to persuade
                        Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FL4">Farbstein</persName> of our wisdom in
                        voting, during the recent General Assembly debate, against the
                        Israel-encouraged resolution calling for direct Israel-Arab peace
                        negotiations (Tab B).<note n="1" xml:id="d186fn1">Tab B is a letter from
                                <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName> to Congressman
                                <persName corresp="#p_FL4">Farbstein</persName> of December 18,
                            1961, pointing out that the U.S. draft resolution submitted during the
                            recent <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> General Assembly debate
                            referenced previous General Assembly resolutions that had urged the
                            governments concerned “to seek agreement by negotiations conducted
                            either with the Conciliation Commission or directly” and affirmed that
                            the governments concerned had the primary responsibility for reaching a
                            settlement. <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName> explained that
                            the United States would be gratified if both sides decided to undertake
                            direct negotiations, but that this did not appear to be a practical
                            possibility until some movement was gained through the quiet diplomacy
                            of the Johnson mission.</note> On January 24 he <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0519"/>introduced a resolution stating the sense
                        of Congress that the United States Delegation to the United Nations should
                        favor direct Israel-Arab peace negotiations (Tab C).<note n="2" xml:id="d186fn2">Tab C is the Congressional print of H. <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss>. 525, January 24, introduced in the
                            House of Representatives and referred to the House Committee on Foreign
                            Affairs.</note></p>
                    <p>We foresee serious complications for the Johnson mission if the resolution is
                        adopted. Most important, it would raise again in Arab minds the bogey of
                        Zionist ability to influence American policy. Arab leadership would
                        inevitably fear that at some critical juncture in the Johnson effort the
                        United States ability to back up whatever agreement might have been reached
                        would be vitiated or turned against them. The progress we made in the recent
                        General Assembly in convincing the Arabs of our impartiality would be
                        dissipated, and heightened suspicion would replace the present willingness
                        to cooperate.</p>
                    <p>Our current strategy is to seek defeat of the <persName corresp="#p_FL4">Farbstein</persName> resolution in Committee. Our chief steps have been

                                questions bearing on the next round of negotiations with the Arab
                                host countries and Israel. It appears that these questions are
                                largely matters of political judgment. Therefore, the gathering of a
                                panel of technical experts such as had been envisaged on January 17
                                no longer appears necessary. Rather, it is hoped to submit these
                                questions of judgment for the personal consideration, on a highly
                                confidential basis, of some 15 or 20 persons who have an objective
                                familiarity with the refugee problem. These persons are to be found
                                in three areas: (a) in the United States Government, (b) in the
                                United Nations, and (c) outside the USG and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Category (c) might be further divided into persons
                                outside the area and persons actually in the Middle East at the
                                present time and so actively associated with the problem that a
                                solicitation of their views might be indiscreet at this early stage
                                (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Davis</persName>, Mr. Roy Lucas).
                                From those in the United States Government only an expression of
                                individual view, not a cleared, coordinated position, is sought at
                                this preliminary juncture. Distribution within the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be limited to three or four
                                officers. Among the outsiders whose names come immediately to mind
                                are individuals such as Norman Burns, Don Peretz, Albert Hourani,
                                Hurewitz. It is hoped that the Department can suggest some
                                additional names (to be given to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> prior to Dr. Johnson’s return from Europe on

                            <p>The questions on which expressions of judgment are desired fall into

                                            throughout discussion as being, perhaps, the maximum

                                            Department officers pointed out the possible merits of

                                        complex of questions is the assumption that all sides will
                                        ultimately agree with the Special Representative that any
                                        solution to the refugee problem will include some
                                        repatriation to Israel as it now exists, some resettlement

                                said the strongly adverse Arab reaction to statements in his
                                original report regarding the need for regional economic development
                                make him aware that this is not a path he can pursue if he is to
                                have any success on political aspects of the problem. Nevertheless,
                                he feels there must be a “separate but parallel” effort in this
                                direction to facilitate the absorption of refugees once there is
                                some movement out of the present political stalemate. He remains
                                convinced of the need for this despite the pessimistic view recently
                                expressed to him by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Eugene
                                    Black</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Black</persName> considers it doubtful that any effort to
                                persuade the states of the area of the advantages of regional
                                economic development will succeed at this time. However, he
                                acknowledges that something hopeful may come out of Kuwait’s
                                announced intention to set up a regional development fund. Dr.
                                Johnson said he hopes the Department will give this whole aspect of
                                the problem further, careful thought. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWRJ1">Crawford</persName> said this would be done,
                                but noted that because of political differences between the Arab
                                states we have found it necessary, almost without exception, to
                                conduct USG aid programs on a bilateral basis.</p>
                            <p>The concept of a multilateral, regional approach has always been
                                attractive, but it is difficult to impose an overlay of economic
                                cooperation on a foundation of political factionalism. Even after
                                study, therefore, <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0522"/>the
                                conclusion may be reached that economic support of refugee
                                integration will have to be primarily through bilateral
                                channels.</p></item>

                                There emerges a consensus that these are (a) some movement, or
                                promise thereof, of refugees prior to the 17th General Assembly, or
                                (b) documentation that such movement is not a practical possibility

                                the refugee problem looking toward a gradual reduction of the US
                                involvement with minimum disruption to area stability, over a
                                multi-year period. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWRJ1">Crawford</persName> remarked that while the US will continue to
                                provide all appropriate support, the road of the Special

                                ingredients of progress on the refugee problem are probably known to
                                many persons, but only the individual negotiator can ultimately
                                determine a combination and timing of these ingredients that will be
                                acceptable to all the parties.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Johnson said he realizes that as the second round is approached

                                of the mountain to be climbed be as broad as possible. Dr. Johnson
                                said he appreciates that the Department must know by mid-summer
                                whether the Special Representative operation has succeeded or
                                failed. He looks toward completion of his final report by the first

                                inevitable. Because of other commitments, the timing of the next
                                Special Representative trip to the area must fall in the period
                                April 1–May 5.</p></item>

                            regarding the degree of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>’s personal involvement and interest in the
                            Special Representative operation. Department officers commented that the
                            President’s continuing personal concern is attested inter alia by the
                            letters he wrote last May to Arab leaders, which were the opening move
                            in <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0523"/>this initiative, and the

                            is “as important a piece of business” as the United States has in

                            negotiations between the Arab states and Israel. The steps being taken
                            by the Department to prevent Committee approval of this resolution were
                            outlined. Dr. Johnson concurred that passage of this resolution would
                            make it appear to the Arab states that the US was going back on the
                            objective stand taken at the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. He
                            stated, further, that he was inclined to think adoption would render it
                            “virtually impossible” for him to continue his mission, and authorized
                            the Department to use this statement in the manner deemed most
                            effective. Department officers concurred in Dr. Johnson’s suggestion
                            that he call Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> in the

                            officers recalled that Dr. Johnson had asked earlier for suggestions
                            about private individuals that he might see while in Israel to provide a
                            broad understanding of Israel attitudes. It was noted that Dr. Johnson
                            had not yet met Rabbi Irving Miller, the new President of the Conference
                            of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, that contact with
                            him by Dr. Johnson is desirable, and that Rabbi Miller might be very
                            helpful in suggesting means whereby Dr. Johnson might meet influential
                            private persons during his next visit to Israel. Mr. Blake of <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> undertook to arrange a meeting

                            referred to the possibility of sampling refugee opinion and of choosing
                            from among the samples a smaller group to be moved during the first year
                            of a repatriation-resettlement project. For example, the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> might try to sample the opinion of

                            free choice during Year One. Department officers expressed doubt that an
                            accurate opinion sample could be obtained in the abstract. It would seem
                            preferable to meld the two operations so that, for example, the first
                            20,000 refugees to record preferences would be given those preferences
                            during Year One.</item>

                            persons, vs. implementing the freely expressed choice of the first
                            20,000 who apply from anywhere in the area, were discussed. It was
                            agreed that this is a decision with which the Arab states must
                            ultimately be identified. If, for example, it were decided to try to
                            vacate a camp in Jordan, other Arab states might turn on Jordan in mid
                            course unless they had concurred in advance in this being the best

                            whether Dr. Johnson had given thought to the nature and timing of a
                            carefully circumscribed Israel declaration of willingness to cooperate
                            in principle in implementation of Paragraph 11. Dr. Johnson concurred
                            that it might be too much to expect Israel to make such a declaration on
                            its own behalf. The actions which Ben-Gurion has taken to buttress
                            Israel’s stand on the refugee problem (his encouragement of the recent
                            Knesset resolution opposing repatriation, etc.) genuinely limit his
                            freedom of action. Dr. Johnson said one might rather look toward
                            announcement by the Special Representative that both parties had agreed
                            to cooperate in implementing during Year One the freely expressed choice
                            of the first 20,000 refugees to record a preference. To this would be
                            added the further statement that all parties had assured the Special
                            Representative of their agreement in principle to continue such
                            cooperation consistent with national security and economic interests. It
                            was agreed that something along this line might (1) satisfy Arab demands
                            for Israel’s acceptance in principle of paragraph 11, and (2) give the
                            Year One pilot project the sense of continuing in the future.</item>

                        had made earlier in connection with this study.</p>
                    <p>The Steering Group report has now been considered at the highest level and it
                        is agreed that an approach should be made to the Shah on the basis of a
                        comprehensive and long-term program, as you suggested last September in
                        response to my original letter explaining the Steering Group project.<note n="2" xml:id="d189fn2">See <ref target="#d172fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                172</ref>.</note> Detailed recommendations to implement this agreed
                        course of action are now being developed at staff level and should be
                        available in approximately two weeks. I am not yet able to tell you the
                        precise nature of the package which will be finally approved, but I can
                        assure you that those working on the problem will take full account of your
                        recommendations. You will have an opportunity to comment on <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0528"/>the proposals before they are embodied in
                        firm instructions to you to make an approach to the Shah.</p>
                    <p>You note certain discrepancies between figures in the Steering Group report
                        and those available to you in Iran. Some of these can be explained by the
                        addition, on the basis of Washington data, of transportation and related
                        costs (<gloss target="#t_PCHT1">PCH&amp;T</gloss>) and the reduction of war
                        reserve ammunition to a 30-day level instead of the 60-day level in your

                                essence of the matter is that direct negotiations are not going to
                                occur at an early date. We had voted against such a resolution in

                    <p>The President expressed pleasure at the opportunity to discuss with His
                        Majesty some of our concerns in the Middle East. He asked the King for his
                        views on the Kuwait-Iraqi relationship and whether <persName corresp="#p_QGAK1">Qassim</persName> would continue to exert pressure on
                        Kuwait. The King expressed confidence that Kuwait would succeed in
                        withstanding Iraqi pressures in view of the support Kuwait enjoys from “all
                        of the Arabs” as well as Great Britain’s vital interest in Kuwait. The
                        President wondered whether this was a sufficient enough deterrent against a
                        possible Iraqi surprise attack on Kuwait which conceivably might be
                        accomplished within the space of a few hours. The King expressed the view
                        that the presence of Arab troops in Kuwait, together with back-up British
                        military support, would be sufficient.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Syria</hi></p>
                    <p>The President asked the King for his views on the new regime in Syria. The
                        King expressed pleasure with the new regime although, contrary to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> assertions, he said Saudi Arabia had had
                        nothing to do with the Syrian secession from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> The President asked whether the King saw any danger
                        signals in the Syrian Government’s economic mission to the Soviet Union. The
                        King expressed confidence that the Syrian Government would remain
                        anti-Soviet and emphasized the importance of U.S. assistance to Syria as
                        insurance. The President indicated that the U.S. is alert to Syria’s need
                        for assistance and has already pledged a certain amount. He said our
                        Ambassador to Syria has returned to Damascus from consultations in
                        Washington with instructions to follow up closely Syria’s need for further
                        U.S. assistance. In response to the President’s question as to the existence
                        of pro-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> sentiment in Syria, the
                        King replied that while many Syrian youth had once been enamored with
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> President now commands virtually no
                        following in the country.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss></hi></p>
                    <p>The President asked the King for his assessment of developments in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> The King reported that at the time of
                        the Suez campaign in 1956 he had pledged <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> his full support and for a number of years Saudi
                        Arabia had enjoyed excellent relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> The recent nationalization and sequestration decrees,
                        however, had revealed <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as a
                        Communist who presents a real danger to the Arab World. (The King repeated
                        this point several times during the meeting.) The President noted that the
                        Communist Party is banned in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> The
                        King contended that this is merely a facade. In response to the President’s
                        question as to how long the King thought <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would stay in power, the King commented that while
                        only God knew, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s days appeared
                        to be numbered. The President asked whether the military in <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0532"/>the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>
                        is disaffected with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The King
                        replied that both military and civilians in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> now oppose <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The King called the President’s attention to the
                        vehement attacks being leveled by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>
                        against both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. He understood the reason Saudi
                        Arabia was the object of these attacks but why the U.S. which continues to
                        provide the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> with economic assistance?
                        The President pointed out that our assistance to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> has been mainly in the form of sales of agricultural
                        surpluses for Egyptian currency for which humanitarian reasons exist. He
                        said our economic assistance to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>
                        should not be misunderstood as supporting <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> policies. Nevertheless, continued the President, we are
                        watching <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s policies carefully
                        and are prepared to review our economic assistance to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in the light of future
                        developments.</p>

                            Assistance to States with Leftist Tendencies</hi></p>
                    <p>The King told the President he wished to speak to him in all candor on the
                        following subject which had been bothering him: U.S. aid to states which
                        have pronounced leftist tendencies and sympathize more with the Soviet Union
                        than with the U.S. The President asked the King specifically what countries
                        he had in mind but did not succeed in eliciting any definite response. The
                        President told the King that the basis of our assistance to such countries
                        as Indonesia, Ghana and Guinea is to reinforce anti-Communist elements in
                        the hope that the latter will eventually assume a predominant role and, at
                        the same time, in order to prevent a further drift to the leftist camp. When
                        the King mentioned the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> in this
                        category, the President said that the same principle applied. The President
                        acknowledged the impossibility of predicting accurately the direction these
                        countries will take. The King commented that there are some countries which
                        are 100 percent Communist which receive U.S. assistance. The President
                        replied that our aid to Yugoslavia, for example, has kept Yugoslavia out of
                        the Warsaw Bloc and this, in turn, has protected the flanks of Greece and
                        Turkey. The President called the King’s attention to the Soviet-Chinese
                        split. The King asked what side the President thought the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> would take in the event of war. The
                        President said this depended on the type of war. It would not matter in the
                        case of nuclear war and should the war be localized, he believed the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> would remain neutral.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">5. Pakistan-Afghanistan Transit
                            Dispute</hi></p>
                    <p>The President informed the King of our concern over the impasse which has
                        been reached in connection with the Pakistan-Afghanistan transit dispute. He
                        reviewed briefly the current history of the problem and pointed out that if
                        the matter is not soon resolved, we will be faced with the necessity of
                        considering the construction of a road of ingress <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0533"/>into Afghanistan through Iran. The
                        Afghanistani action in reopening the border on a temporary basis has helped
                        somewhat, he observed. The President recalled that the Saudi Government had
                        been helpful in the preliminary stages of negotiating a settlement of the
                        1955 Pakistan- Afghanistan dispute and asked the King for his views on how
                        the problem might now be ameliorated. The King replied that he, too, has
                        been concerned at the existence of this dispute between these two
                        neighboring Moslem countries. He expressed a desire to help again if this
                        could be effective, and called attention to the Soviet pressures being
                        placed upon Afghanistan. (Jemal Hussaini remarked that as a former member of
                        the Saudi negotiation team in 1955 he believed that Afghanistan would resist
                        Soviet domination to the last man.) The King stated that while in the
                        hospital in Boston he had received letters from the chiefs-of-state of both
                        Afghanistan and Pakistan independently seeking his support. He mentioned a
                        long-standing invitation from the Afghanistan Government to visit the
                        country and indicated the possibility that upon his return to Saudi Arabia
                        he might take advantage of this invitation to offer his mediation
                        services.</p>

                            and Southern Arabia</hi></p>
                    <p>The King asked for the President’s forebearance while he raised three
                        subjects uppermost on his mind: Algeria, Palestine and Southern Arabia. With
                        regard to Algeria, the King expressed appreciation for the position the
                        President had taken while a Senator and hoped the President’s views had not
                        changed. The U.S. should use its influence to assure a “favorable” solution.
                        With regard to Palestine, the King indicated the importance of implementing
                        the 1947 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions and thus adhering to
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> charter. On the subject of Southern
                        Arabia he referred to the British policy of “colonialism” in the southern
                        part of the Arabian Peninsula, including that affecting Buraimi. The King
                        expressed the hope that the U.S. would persuade the British to modify their
                        policies in this area.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated optimism that the matter would be settled soon. He
                        pointed out General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> is
                        doing his very best under trying circumstances. On Palestine, the President
                        recalled the correspondence last year he had exchanged with the King on the
                        subject and said that he was fully aware how strongly Saudi Arabia feels on
                        this issue. He acknowledged the “gap” in the respective U.S.-Saudi
                        approaches to the problem, but pointed out that the United States wishes at
                        the same time to maintain good relations with both Israel and with Saudi
                        Arabia. With regard to the King’s comments on Southern Arabia, the President
                        stated that he was not fully informed on the subject and following
                        consultation, we would be in touch with His Majesty.</p>

                            Assistance</hi></p>
                    <p>The King reminded the President that Saudi Arabia is a relatively backward
                        country whose native resources are inadequate to cover the growing needs and
                        appetites of a population of some 10 million. (Note: An exaggeration of
                        approximately 4 to 5 million.) He said Saudi Arabia is in dire need of
                        hospitals, schools, ports, roads and artesian wells, and relies on the
                        United States for required assistance. The President noted that the Saudi
                        Arabian Government has hired a number of technicians including, in
                        particular, Mr. Harold Folk, an American employed as the top planning
                        advisor in the new Supreme Planning Board. He expressed his understanding
                        that the World Bank had prepared a development plan for Saudi Arabia which
                        was being executed under the aegis of these technicians. Nevertheless, he
                        continued, the U.S. would be prepared to discuss the matter of possible
                        economic assistance with the Saudi Government and suggested that the
                        Ambassador might wish to raise the subject with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Fowler Hamilton</persName>, among others in the State
                        Department. The King wondered whether the United States might be able to
                        send an economic mission to Saudi Arabia and whether, in any case, the U.S.
                        could agree in principle at the outset to providing economic assistance. The
                        President replied that we would first need information on specific projects
                        and areas of need before making any decision. He said the U.S. would be
                        delighted to receive a Saudi economic mission and would be willing to
                        dispatch a mission to Saudi Arabia. He expressed certainty that U.S. lending
                        institutions would be willing to consider projects which the Saudi Arabian
                        Government might wish to submit on their merits.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">8. Status of <gloss target="#t_USMTM1">USMTM</gloss></hi></p>
                    <p>The King called attention to the needs of his Government to develop a strong
                        military force. His Government, he said, was requesting the U.S. to retain
                        its Military Training Mission in Saudi Arabia but on a reduced scale of 80
                        officers and men. The President replied that we are prepared to be
                        sympathetic to the proposal to retain the <gloss target="#t_USMTM1">USMTM</gloss> but the figure of 80 is too small. With the removal of
                        the Second Air Division from Dhahran, the administrative requirements of the
                        mission would increase and an adequate training job could not be
                        accomplished with less than some 200 men. The King said that the reason for
                        his desire to reduce the size of the mission was to economize. The King was
                        then informed that the U.S. defrays the costs of the <gloss target="#t_USMTM1">USMTM</gloss> with the exception of housing and local
                        transportation. The King commented that if the U.S. could pay for all the
                        costs of the mission, it could be any size.</p>

                    <p>The King stated he would also like the U.S. to arrange credit terms for the
                        most recent Saudi request for the purchase of about $16 million <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0535"/>worth of arms and equipment in accordance
                        with the 1957 arms sale agreement. The President asked for the status of
                        existing credit payments and was told that several more payments are still
                        due. The King expressed regret at Saudi delinquency in past payments and
                        said he wished to correct this. The President informed the King we would
                        look into the matter of further credits and would ask the Saudis to indicate
                        the nature of the credit arrangements they had in mind.</p>

                            Difficulties</hi></p>
                    <p>The President told the King that there were two irritants in U.S.-Saudi
                        relations which he wished to draw to the King’s attention, the first of
                        which was the matter of customs difficulties experienced by our Consulate
                        General personnel at Dhahran. The President said he hesitated to bother the
                        King about such an administrative matter, but this was causing us a serious
                        operational problem. The King referred to the matter of reciprocity in
                        privileges accorded Consular personnel. It was pointed out to the King that
                        reciprocity already exists and yet equipment for our Consulate General in
                        Dhahran continues to remain in customs. The King promised to look into the
                        matter and pledged all possible assistance. He asked that in the future the
                        American Ambassador in Saudi Arabia deal directly with the King on this
                        matter.</p>

                            Jews</hi></p>
                    <p>Another irritant the President referred to was the inability of American
                        citizens of Jewish faith to transit Dhahran airport and the refusal of the
                        Saudi Government to issue visas to American Congressmen of Jewish faith. The
                        King replied that the Saudi restrictions are only placed upon Zionists and
                        that “many” non-Zionist American Jews have visited Saudi Arabia. The
                        President commented that Congressmen of the Jewish faith, whether or not
                        they are Zionists, are Americans who have pledged allegiance to the United
                        States. The Saudi refusal to allow them to enter Saudi Arabia is grist for
                        the propaganda mill and hurts the Saudi cause. The President surmised that
                        some who claim a desire to visit Saudi Arabia would probably not go once
                        they were issued visas. The President stated that Saudi policy in this
                        regard is more extreme than that pursued by other Arab states. The King
                        promised that he would give the matter consideration after his return to
                        Saudi Arabia and expressed his intention to apply the policy followed by
                        other Arab states.<note n="3" xml:id="d191fn3">Telegram 983 to Cairo

                    <p>Our aim in providing aid, in all cases upon <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> request, has been to: (a) provide <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> with some alternative to total
                        dependence on the Bloc; (b) help turn <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        energies inward, as has seemed to be happening after Syrian coup; (c) give
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> some vested interest in
                        good relations with us—and by inference with our allies; and (d) help
                        reassure <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that the US, while
                        not endorsing his policies, is not actively hostile. In essence, our aid has
                        been part of a long-term strategy toward an important neutralist state,
                        still the most influential in the Arab world.</p>
                    <p>Those of us who favor this strategy are fully conscious both of the risks
                        involved and the limited prospects for any quick or far-reaching results. At
                        best we can only expect to pull <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> back from leaning too far eastward, exert some
                        moderating influence on his meddling in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>
                        and African affairs, and encourage him to focus his energies as much as
                        possible on Egypt’s own internal development. But if one regards even these
                        goals as important, they seem to justify aid at least as great as that we
                        are now providing the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Whichever way we go, however, our policy toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is a matter of sufficient import to deserve a full review.
                        We don’t want to back into a new policy via a series of aid offers, without
                        knowing where we want to go. Therefore, in view of your reservations about
                        our <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policy, I urge a frank airing of the
                        whole issue with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and
                        your key advisers. The best timing would be as soon as we have <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>’ full report from Cairo, which
                        should be in by the middle of next week (he will not be back till 21

                                is clear, for the moment at least, that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has made decision to try to improve its relations

                                Also some hints in our conversations that arms race with Israel

                                Government there is genuine fear that Israel, France and Britain are

                                Whether true or not, it is deeply believed in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and this makes it a factor in

                    <p>My five days in and around Cairo were more encouraging than I had
                        anticipated. Two talks with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>,
                        totalling more than five hours, gave me an opportunity to outline the global
                        policies of the new Administration in some depth, to exchange views on the
                        Middle East, and to discuss the complexities of Egypt-US relations.</p>
                    <p>These talks were extremely cordial with no show of emotion at any time.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was restrained, and his
                        views were frankly and clearly presented. My discussions with Vice President
                        Muhiyadin, Vice President Baghdadi, and Minister of the Presidency <persName corresp="#p_SA7">Ali Sabri</persName>, followed the same pattern.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Government has made
                        a decision to improve its relations with the US, and they considered my

                        basis for a more understanding relationship.</p>

                            improvement of conditions of the Egyptian people. They are conscious of
                            the economic injustices which have plagued Egypt for generations and
                            determined to eliminate them.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item><p>The leaders of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> are
                                pragmatists searching for techniques that will enable them to expand
                                their economy rapidly and to maintain their political grip.</p>
                            <p>Egyptian industry has been traditionally oriented towards extremely
                                high, short-term profit margins and restrictive practices with
                                little interest in basic long-range investment. Although the
                                government made some effort to encourage foreign investment the
                                results were disappointing.</p>
                            <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0543"/>
                            <p>When <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his colleagues
                                lost confidence in their ability to achieve their economic
                                objectives through the Egyptian version of free enterprise, they
                                began to move toward more centralized control.</p>
                            <p>The recent step up of economic centralization reflected the
                                government’s frustration and anger following the Syrian break and
                                the fear of a domestic coup in Egypt.</p>
                            <p>After moving far in the direction of public ownership the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Government now appears to be having
                                some second thoughts. Several real or potential opponents of the
                                regime have been released from jail. Some property has recently been
                                returned to its owners.</p>
                            <p>In my talks with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> I
                                stressed the political danger of any government taking
                                responsibility for too many economic decisions. He appeared
                                moderately responsive.</p>
                            <p><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is acutely aware of the
                                need for a better urban-rural balance. Several of his associates
                                with whom I talked were born in the villages and expressed strong
                                views on the traditional exploitation of the peasants and the need
                                for what amounts to the creation of new rural societies based on
                                small farms and cooperative credit and distribution
                            systems.</p></item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item><p>The view of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his
                                associates on the Soviet Union and Communist China appears to me to
                                be equally pragmatic. They will use the Soviets as a source of arms
                                or investment whenever it suits their purpose (precisely as they
                                will use us). However, they are skeptical of Soviet economic and
                                political concepts and even more skeptical of the Chinese.</p>
                            <p>If they have a model I believe it is Yugoslavia, which is developing
                                its economy along equally pragmatic lines. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> indicated a surprising,
                                practical knowledge of our own economy, particularly of our federal
                                tax system and the division of our national income.</p>
                            <p>While <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his
                                colleagues are willing to take economic and military aid from the
                                Sino-Soviet Bloc and to work closely with Tito, they are firmly
                                intent on keeping Communism out of the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was scathing in his comments
                                on theoretical Marxism; Vice-President Zakariya Muhiyadin and
                                Presidential Intelligence Director Sami Sharaf were also outspoken
                                on this point.</p>
                            <p>I believe it is fair to say that whatever frustrations we may have in
                                Egypt in the next few years are likely to be more than equalled by
                                those of the Kremlin.</p></item>

                            <item><p>In the event of a Soviet attack the US is confident of its
                                    continuing ability to inflict unacceptable damage to the Soviet
                                    Union. Furthermore, <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0545"/>we
                                    have the will to face up to the Soviet threats. (I do not think
                                    the Egyptians harbor any doubts on this score.)</p>
                                <p>At the same time, we have no conflict with the Russian people. We
                                    genuinely seek an arms control system with suitable safeguards,
                                    and we are prepared to negotiate sincerely towards this end.</p>
                                <p>We are also determined to use our great economic power and that
                                    of our Atlantic Community allies to enable and encourage
                                    non-Communist Asian, African and Latin American nations to build
                                    viable economies. I believe that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> realizes this and hopes to profit from
                                    it.</p></item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item><p>In this context we have no wish to impose our system upon other
                                    nations. Our assistance programs in Yugoslavia and Ghana bear
                                    witness to this principle.</p>
                                <p>I was frank in saying that in many ways the policies which the
                                    new Administration inherited in January 1961 were the result of
                                    the special pressures of the post-war period. Of particular
                                    importance was our concern that the Soviet Union, which had
                                    launched the North Korean armies across the 38th parallel, might
                                    embark on similar aggressions elsewhere.</p>
                                <p>Although the principles on which these policies are based may no
                                    longer be relevant in all instances, we shall faithfully live up
                                    to the commitments already made.</p>
                                <p>In dealing with many countries, however, we will gradually move
                                    towards a different emphasis which will be more in line with the
                                    realities with which both we and they must contend in the coming
                                    years.</p>
                                <p>I laid particular stress on US objectives in the Middle East,
                                    emphasizing again and again that we had no desire to control the
                                    area (even if we could), that we are no longer narrowly
                                    dependent on Middle Eastern oil, and that our primary objective
                                    is to foster the development of independent countries capable of
                                    making their own free choices within the framework of their own
                                    cultures.</p>
                                <p>In particular, we had no desire to bring pressure to bear on
                                    Egypt. We accept Egypt’s policy of non-alignment and as long as
                                    the Cairo Government remains truly non-aligned we have no desire
                                    to change the situation.</p></item>

                                    liquidated.</p>
                                <p>Above all we were earnestly hopeful, first for a closer
                                    understanding between the United States and the nations of the

                                    out of that understanding. We know that this cannot be achieved

                            <p>Although I do not want to emphasize my personal ideas on Egypt’s
                                economic development on the eve of the <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName> mission, I would like to suggest that US aid
                                to the rural areas of Egypt is likely to pay particularly big
                                dividends.</p>
                            <p>The Aswan Dam will gradually increase Egypt’s cultivated lands by
                                roughly one-third. This will require the creation of new communities
                                to farm these lands, with new schools, roads, clinics, and a modern
                                rural extension service. Plans for this comprehensive effort are in
                                the earliest planning stages.</p>
                            <p>This development will profoundly affect the lives of the millions of
                                Egyptians who will occupy these lands. If we were to take the
                                leadership on a down-to-earth basis in organizing this vast new
                                source of productivity, we may obtain greater practical political
                                dividends from the Aswan High Dam than the Russians themselves.</p>
                            <p>Our <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 funds are already playing
                                an important role in Egypt. I think that I was able to persuade
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> of their vast
                                importance in helping build his country. This program could well be
                                expanded and extended.</p>
                            <p>In addition, the Egyptians will undoubtedly try to persuade <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Ed Mason</persName> of their need for a loan
                                of roughly $125 million to purchase machinery in the US for
                                industrial development. Our response to this proposal, it seems to
                                me, should be tied to the feasibility of each project as well as to

                        <item><p>Although he gave no hint, it is clear that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would be pleased by an
                                invitation to visit the United States. He spoke in the warmest terms
                                    <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0548"/>of the recent letters
                                from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>. The
                                fact that he and his senior officials returned to the subject
                                several times persuaded me that their respect for the President is
                                genuine.</p>
                            <p>An invitation may help to moderate his attitudes and pronouncements
                                and to keep him in better balance.</p>
                            <p>It would be naive, however, for us to assume that such a visit would
                                assure us a docile <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. For
                                instance, it would not be surprising following his visit to the US
                                if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> should attempt to
                                redress the balance by a visit to the Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>Although there are strong arguments on both sides of the case, on
                                balance I am persuaded that we have much more to gain than to lose
                                by inviting <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to the US.
                                In my view the time has come to take the plunge.</p></item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item><p>If we agree that it will be wise to issue the invitation, the next
                                question involves the timing. If he comes soon the pressure of
                                Congressional matters and the forthcoming elections point to a visit
                                the latter half of April. Otherwise, I believe it should be
                                postponed to sometime in November following the elections.</p>
                            <p>The arguments in favor of the later date are in some ways persuasive.
                                It may be argued that by inviting <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> now to visit us in November we will receive
                                some immediate benefits, while providing a lever which may serve to
                                moderate his activities and utterances during the next eight
                                months.</p>
                            <p>In addition, it may be said that it is safer to invite him after the
                                elections since an incident might occur during his visit which would
                                be embarrassing from a political point of view.</p>
                            <p>On balance, however, I favor the April date. Our relations with the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> are now more susceptible to
                                improvement than at any point since 1956 and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s expectancy that these
                                relations can be furthered is very real.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, I am convinced that key Jewish leaders in the US may be
                                persuaded to see the advantages for Israel should a visit result in
                                genuine relaxation of tensions in the area.</p>
                            <p>If the meeting is postponed until November there is an excellent
                                chance that the present fragile expectancy may be destroyed by some
                                sudden development in the Middle East or elsewhere, and the
                                opportunity lost.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, once the invitation has been offered it will surely become
                                public. If the visit is eight months away trouble makers in both the
                                United States and in the Middle East will have ample time to deprive
                                us of what I believe may be an opportunity to improve our relations
                                with this difficult, unpredictable, but key country.</p></item>

                                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his

                                        of our discussions and the cordial basis on which they were
                                        conducted. This encourages him to feel that a more precise
                                        identification of our areas of common interest would be
                                        beneficial.</p>
                                    <p>To this end, he would like to suggest that President
                                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> come to
                                        the United States for a visit as the President’s guest. This
                                        would give him an opportunity to see something of our
                                        country and also to discuss at greater length some of the
                                        common problems which we face in all parts of the world.</p>
                                    <p>The latter part of April would be a particularly convenient
                                        time for President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and he urgently hopes that President

                                </quote></p>
                            <p>In closing let me underscore my conviction that we must not lose
                                sight of our strategic interests in any part of the world as a
                                result of frustrations with individual personalities, however
                                exasperating they may be.</p>
                            <p>It would be foolhardy for us to expect <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> or any likely successor to stop acting like
                                the revolutionary leader that he clearly is, no matter what gestures
                                toward him we may make.</p>
                            <p>Progress towards a more constructive relationship, however, is
                                possible. If the present opportunity is missed it may not soon
                                reoccur.</p></item>

                    <p>On February 21 Syrian Prime Minister Dawalibi handed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName> a note protesting Israel’s intention
                        to divert Jordan River water to the Negev.<note n="1" xml:id="d197fn1">See
                                <ref target="#d198fn2">footnote 2, Document 198</ref>.</note>
                        Similar notes were presented to the other three Security <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0551"/>Council members who have diplomatic
                        missions in Damascus: the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and Rumania.</p>
                    <p>The Syrian note is the most recent development in a flurry of speculation and
                        concern on this problem which has swept the area in the past two weeks,
                        centering on reports that Israel will commence diversion of the Jordan in
                        the near future. We regard these as without foundation, having no evidence
                        of any change in the timetable of Israel’s announced plans to commence
                        limited diversion in August or September 1963. We trace the present flurry,
                        rather, to two factors: (a) Cairo’s propaganda needling of Syria and Jordan,
                        following dissolution of the union with Syria, for alleged acquiescence in
                        Israel’s “seizure of Arab water”, and (b) the desire of Syria and Jordan, in
                        countering this, to prove their “Arabism” by a show of belligerence. This
                        may have, for them, the added advantage of screening two potentially
                        constructive moves: Jordan’s request for <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> assistance in water development programs, particularly
                        construction of the Maqarin Dam on the Yarmuk (in connection with which Sir
                        William Iliff and General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>
                        will visit the area in mid-March), and the presumably related reactivation
                        of a Syria-Jordan joint commission to study Yarmuk development.</p>
                    <p>Although aware of the probable motivation of the Syrian note and of Jordan’s
                        bellicose statements during the recent visit to Amman of Arab League
                        Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_HMAK1">Hassouna</persName>, we would
                        not like to see these actions lead us into a Security Council debate at this

                        to do what we can to take some of the heat out of this issue at all points

                                <persName corresp="#p_MES2">MASON</persName> MISSION</p>
                        <p>Since Suez, economic matters—or more explicitly U.S. aid—has been an area
                            in which U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations
                            reflected a spirit of satisfactory cooperation. The resumption of U.S.
                            assistance, which had been halted subsequent to the Suez crisis, led to
                            a normalization of relations in favorable contrast to the low point in
                            the 1956–58 period. While the magnitude of our aid, especially in the
                            form of food, has steadily expanded, the modestly cooperative atmosphere
                            accompanying it has not noticeably improved. A plateau seems to have
                            been reached in our overall relations. Under present arrangements, it
                            has no doubt appeared to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> that
                            the U.S. doles out aid the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> [solely
                            ?] needs, such as wheat, while remaining ready at any time to withhold
                            further deliveries.</p>
                        <p>U.S. willingness to continue its help, however, through periods of
                            heightened political disagreement such as the Congo crisis has
                            apparently resulted in some increased confidence in U.S. intentions.</p>
                        <p>The past six to eight months have witnessed probing by both sides.
                            Initially the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> asked the U.S. to
                            consider a multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 sales
                            program to facilitate its longer term economic development planning and
                            endeavored to ascertain more clearly U.S. intentions with respect to
                            economic development loans. On the U.S. side, we began to consider
                            whether a less cautious posture could lead to greater mutual confidence
                            in U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations and facilitate
                            achievement of our broader objectives in the area.</p>
                        <p>In this atmosphere the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassador
                            reported to his government conversations with Administration spokesmen
                            regarding U.S. aid criteria. Subsequently he conveyed to U.S. officials
                            on specific authority of President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> a request for U.S. assistance of three main
                            elements: (a) high level planning assistance; (b) a consortium for
                            development financing; and (c) a long term commitment on food
                            supply.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName>’s mission represents an
                            initial response to (a). With regard to (c), we have already informed
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> we are prepared
                                <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0560"/>to consider a multi-year
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 sales agreement. Both
                            responses are probing rather than definitive. One of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName>’s missions is to determine and
                            advise the U.S. whether and in what form planning aid might be
                            considered. Our <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 approach is
                            intended to produce recognition and acknowledgement by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> of the real value of our food
                            supply.</p>
                        <p>Whatever its professed desires, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s
                            primary objective in its current approaches to the U.S. appears to be to
                            obtain increased financial assistance.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is likely to try to
                            derive from the <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName> mission (a)
                            a loan of as much as $125 million to tide it over the present crisis;
                            (b) U.S. support vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> to
                            eliminate current obstacles to creation of an <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>-supported stabilization fund; (c) assurances of
                            continuity of American economic aid; and (d) U.S. support for an
                            international consortium to mobilize resources on a long term basis for
                            carrying out the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s five-year plan.
                            The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will no doubt also seek American
                            or international planning help but probably desires this only in the
                            context of assurances of larger contributions of American aid.</p>
                        <p>To a certain extent, thus, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            objectives will be in conflict with our own which are geared to long
                            term assistance to Egypt as an entity rather than as short term help to
                            the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regime per se. Our
                            objectives can perhaps be reconciled, however, within the framework of
                            (a) a multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 agreement; (b) a
                            sound <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> stabilization program; (c) the
                            possibility of sending a planning team; and (d) a possible
                            pre-consortium study by the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> has recently
                            emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that we will
                            have to move into the economic picture on a step-by-step basis with each
                            step being measured in terms of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            responsiveness and in terms of sound economic justification.</p>

                    <p>Despite your hesitations about our policy toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, I believe that <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Ed
                            Mason</persName>’s brief, exploratory visit will be a useful follow-on
                            <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0561"/>to <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> probe. His trip as a planning consultant is another
                        step in our effort to turn the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> inward
                        toward greater focus on its own domestic problems instead of constant
                        meddling in the other Arab states and Africa. When we told <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> via a personal message from you that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName> is coming and that we
                        expect him to be given every facility, Nasser’s reception was cordial.</p>
                    <p>Before talking with <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName>, you should
                        read Chester <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>’ long despatch on
                        his Cairo visit<note n="1" xml:id="d202fn1"><ref target="#d195">Document
                                195</ref>.</note> which strongly endorses sending <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName> as part of our long-term policy
                        toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> also comes down in favor of an invitation to
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> this April, but the State
                        Department has since decided against so proposing, although leaving open the
                        possibility of a visit toward the end of the year.</p>
                    <p>Though <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName>’s visit commits us to
                        nothing, it will inevitably stimulate <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        desires for, and expectations of, further US aid. I think you will want to
                        caution <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName> not to indicate in any
                        manner the likeli<persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> of further US
                        commitments beyond those already made (e.g. multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480). Instead you might want to suggest he
                        emphasize that US aid to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will depend
                        upon our evaluation of Nasser’s policies about which we have many
                        reservations.</p>

                    <p>Dawalibi, who seemed tired and somewhat discouraged, expressed disappointment
                        at US reaction which he found somewhat one-sided and legalistic in spirit.
                        In his view the question is not whether or not Israel draws from <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss> or Tiberias, now or a little later, more or
                        less water than contemplated in <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan which,
                        however valid it may be technically, was turned down by all Arab
                        governments. This, said Prime Minister, is greatest mistake of USG, which
                        seeks through technical means to solve a problem which is essentially
                        political. Syria and other Arabs are still at war with Israel. <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> does not recognize Israel as a state and
                        still less as a legal claimant on Jordan waters. Considering itself at war
                        with Israel,<gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> seeks to interdict
                        development of Negev which in turn would permit new waves of immigrants
                        “which would constitute military reinforcements.”</p>
                    <p>Dawalibi stressed that his prime objective was through all means at his
                        disposal to induce USG to take new substantive look at entire Israel
                        problem. If situation allowed to coast along or is handled by officialdom on
                        routine and “bureaucratic” basis it will inevitably sooner or later lead to
                        a regional catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>I asked Prime Minister if he could develop what he had in mind when seeking
                        over-all substantive new look by USG. I said that apart from pros and cons
                        re creation of Israel—in which large <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        majority, including Soviets, had participated—that country was a fact today.
                        Any new look on basis of oft expressed Arab objective of Israel delenda est
                        obviously out of question. To this Dawalibi clearly answered that, while he
                        knew that many members of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> who had voted
                        for creation Israel would not vote against, his purpose was not to go back
                        over past but rather see what could be done to insure the peace, taking
                        today’s situation as point of departure. At one point I sought
                        unsuccessfully clarification of what I am quite sure Dawalibi intended as
                        reference to guarantees against further Jewish immigration and other “solid”
                        guarantees. As Dawalibi dodged the issue and as I was merely seeking
                        ascertain direction of his thinking, I let matter drop.</p>
                    <p>At close of talk, which had lasted one hour, Dawalibi said with first show of
                        emotion in several meetings I have had with him how much he wanted to
                        penetrate barriers of officialdom and bureaucracy so as to make USG feel
                        depth of his conviction that new and unprejudiced look at entire Israel
                        problem must be taken by US “as real world leader” if eventual catastrophe
                        not to befall this key area.</p>
                    <p>I said I would do my best convey depth his conviction but that in same spirit
                        I wanted make sure of non-existence of any misunderstanding, which in such
                        cases would do utmost harm. Thus I did not want very real appreciation of
                        USG and myself for <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss>’s concern re matter
                        at hand to obscure basic US position on aggression; we are not allies of
                        Israel against Arabs; we stand however for peaceful settlements of disputes
                            <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0563"/>and against resort to arms;
                        therefore while not easy to say so, Prime Minister should expect to find us
                        in opposition in case of Arab military move.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister expressed appreciation for spirit in which I had spoken.</p>
                    <p>He added he would keep my comments for himself as coming from a friend
                        because he feared that some of his colleagues, unfamiliar with manner in
                        which they had been expressed, might interpret them as a threat. This
                        exchange took place in relaxed and friendly atmosphere.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> As I was waiting for Dawalibi with his
                        Executive Secretary Juwayjati, latter, who is most friendly, made two
                        interesting comments: 1) in answer to question he said on basis all
                        information at his disposal <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was
                        playing no role either positive or negative in Jordan waters crisis; 2)
                        spontaneously he told me “off the record” that Prime Minister had exclaimed
                        to him in private “Why did Jordan have to stir up crisis at this time”.</p>
                    <p>For what it may be worth I believe Dawalibi neither plans nor wishes military
                        action now. However, I believe he is deeply sincere in his expressed
                        conviction that war will result if Arab-Israel situation continues on
                        present collision course. Therefore his earnest entreaty for a new look. I
                        am of course well aware of many contradictory and vastly complicated facts
                        of this problem which face Department. I would however not be doing my job
                        if I did not convey to Department my view that Prime Minister is considering
                        problem from angle of over-all and long-range Israel threat and power
                        relationship and that such considerations as to whether Israel withdraws
                        Jordan water through <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss> or from Lake Tiberias
                        not germane to his thinking.</p>
                    <p>Also, while Juwayjati’s comment may well have been entirely factual report of
                        Prime Minister’s feelings re unwelcome muddying of Jordan waters by Amman at
                        this time, I believe it would be hazardous to place undue significance on
                        this remark. Instead I am unfortunately convinced that Dawalibi moved by
                        substantive and long-range elements of problem quite apart from tactical and
                        timing considerations implicit in above quoted comment.</p>

                            defensive, with a heavy emphasis on “now let me give you the inside dope
                            about the traitors in our midst.” <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> emphasized the continuing <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> dedication to Arab unity and to social justice. He
                            attacked several Syrian officials, condemning them for American
                            contacts, castigated King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                            and Saudi Arabia, but included “relatively mild” references to Israel.
                            The Embassy concluded that, by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s standards, the speech was “’non-aligned’, in
                            that while Arab traitors who connive with West were attacked, West
                            itself not direct target, and Soviet bloc unmentioned” and that “all in
                            all, this was one of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
                            less significant pronunciamentos.”</note> Following so closely on his
                        talks with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>, the
                        speech forces us to the conclusion that for reasons best known to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> he has higher priorities at present
                        than the improvement in the atmosphere for United States-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p>In the belief that in principle it remains desirable to invite <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to the United States in due course,
                        we recommend the reservation of a block of time in December for such a visit
                        following the Congressional elections. We would commence early in the Fall
                        an evaluation of its suitability and utility, bearing in mind the possible
                        visit to Israel at the beginning of November by former President Truman, and
                        the fact that we have tentatively set aside time in late November or early
                        December for a State Visit by President Tito of Yugoslavia to whom an
                        invitation has already been extended.</p>
                    <p>Apart from delay in an invitation to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, we intend to continue our current program of
                        step-by-step efforts to draw the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> into a
                        closer relationship with the long-range objectives of providing the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> an acceptable alternative to primary
                        reliance on the Sino-Soviet Bloc, assisting in the more rapid development
                        and modernization of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and ultimately
                        moderating some of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s more extreme
                        policies. We continue to believe we should avoid public controversy with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, discussing our differences frankly
                        in private.</p>

                                205</ref>.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> withdraws his proposal that you consider a <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit in April, despite the
                        favorable recommendations from <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>. State still believes that
                        a cautious step-by-step effort to get on a better footing with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is sound policy, but backs off from a visit
                        now because of your reluctance and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s continued bad behavior after our initial
                        probes.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> urges, however, that we hold open
                        the possibility of a visit in December. It costs nothing to do so, as long
                        as there are no leaks. In fact, if there is an 18-power summit meeting
                        you’ll have an opportunity to see <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and decide for yourself whether a later visit would
                        be useful.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, to see the case for a <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit you should read the attached views of
                        Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d206fn2">In
                            telegram 1247 from Cairo, February 21, <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> registered his strong support for <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>’ recommendation that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit the United States in the
                            spring of 1962. He added: “No miracles should be expected but strong
                            effort increase understanding and urge <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> moderation essential and can most effectively be made
                            by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> in personal
                            contact with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Same
                            negative factors arguing against spring visit can be cited against visit
                            at any other time. Therefore believe we should choose spring date as
                            offering more hope for beneficial after effects.” (Department of State,
                            Central Files, 786B.11/2–2162) <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>’ views are in Document 195.</note> To my mind the
                        same strategic considerations which dictate our policy toward Tito, Sukarno,
                        and other neutralists are valid in the case of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. If we invited Tito, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will be the only major neutralist who has never been
                        to the US; thus singling him out will almost compel him to react
                        unfavorably.</p>
                    <p>It is the Arab/Israeli issue which makes a visit difficult; paradoxical as it
                        may seem, however, better relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> might give us more leverage toward promoting an
                        ultimate Arab/Israeli settlement than any other course. Egypt’s attitude is
                        the key to such a settlement; no other Arab state dares get out ahead of
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in moving toward a
                        settlement lest he revile it as a traitor. Moreover, the new Syrian
                        Government’s agitation over the Jordan waters may well heat up the whole
                        Arab/Israeli situation again. Hence it may become important for you to
                        discuss this problem personally with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>

                    <p>Despite the political risks, I also continue to believe it worth an
                        investment of your time and prestige to influence <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> toward a less radical stance; he can
                        cause us a lot more trouble if actively hostile than if he has a vested
                        interest in good relations with us.</p>

                            682 from Tehran, March 5, <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>
                            reported that Iranian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_QNH1">Qods-Nakhai</persName>, then serving as Acting Prime Minister, had
                            conveyed a message from the Shah that the current situation with regard
                            to the Iranian armed forces could not continue. The Shah felt that the
                            United States did not understand Iran’s vulnerability and need for
                            adequately equipped armed forces; if something were not done, the Shah
                            could not continue as supreme commander of the armed forces. <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> also indicated that British
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> had reported
                            on a casual meeting with the Shah on the ski slopes, during which the
                            Shah had talked for over one-half hour in a similar vein. <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> had expressed genuine concern
                            over the Shah’s state of mind. (Ibid., 788.11/3–562)</note> I had
                        audience of one and a half hours with Shah this morning. Following exchange
                        of amenities I opened the discussion, as I had sought the meeting, by
                        inquiring the significance of the message conveyed to me by the FonMin on
                        March 5. I said that I was somewhat surprised and at a loss to understand
                        how the Shah could relinquish the position of Commander-in-Chief as to do so
                        would be entirely unconstitutional.</p>
                    <p>He replied that this was indeed the case and that the implication was that if
                        the situation did not improve in such a manner to permit him to carry out a
                        program of stability, security and reform, that he would be unable to
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>He said substantially the things he had said to Yatsevitch as stated in [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                        citation which I need not <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0569"/>repeat

                            Document 209.</note> He said that he had worked hard for twenty years
                        and could not see success ahead, that he felt that he was about to lose both
                        faith and face. He felt that the U.S. either didn’t understand the
                        importance of Iran to the free world and the situation here or didn’t care.
                        He reviewed the consequences to the free world of the loss of Iran to the
                        Soviets.</p>
                    <p>I reminded the Shah that on several occasions he had asked me to be utterly
                        frank with him and then I gave him plain talk, first, with regard to his
                        responsibilities not only to himself but to his country and followed this by
                        a statement that his declaration to me smacked of threat which would not be
                        well received in Washington and was not designed to accomplish the results
                        he sought. I told him that it was obviously incorrect to suggest that the
                        U.S. did not understand the importance of Iran and did not care about it,
                        citing the fact that conclusive evidence of such comprehension and concern
                        had been shown in the past. I then gave him, not for the first time, an
                        explanation of the administration’s policy to emphasize economic aid over
                        military in the conviction that economic and social improvement was the
                        surest way to achieve long-term strength in a nation such as Iran. I did not
                        fail to point out that even though our resources are great they are still
                        limited and that the demands upon them are so extensive that they had to be
                        distributed in such a manner as to produce the greatest benefit for all the
                        free world. I added that there was a body of opinion in the U.S. which felt
                        that because of the drain on our gold reserves foreign aid should be
                        drastically reduced or stopped but that the administration, after careful
                        study and calculation, had concluded that it is possible to continue to
                        assist other nations of the free world on a large scale in spite of the
                        drain on gold and risk to the international value of the dollar.</p>
                    <p>The Shah professed to understand all of this and then launched into his
                        favorite comparison of the treatment accorded Turkey and Iran. He again
                        pointed out that, in his view, Iran was the best basically equipped in this
                        part of the world to establish as strong bastion both from a military and
                        political point of view. I agreed with this but pointed out again that the
                        ultimate strength of the nation lay in its economic and social improvement.
                        The Shah responded to this by saying that assistance on a major scale for
                        Iran would only be required for a limited time because, with its capacity
                        for growth, the country would be able to maintain itself within a few years.
                        He reverted to a comparison with Turkey and I pointed out to him that he was
                        in error if he believed that the U.S. classified its allies as good,
                        indifferent and bad and parceled out economic <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0570"/>and military aid on this basis. I told him that all of our
                        aid is supplemental of indigenous resources and that it is allocated as
                        judiciously as possible in order to maintain the strength of our allies and
                        to encourage progress. Said that on this basis Turkey obviously required
                        more help than Iran particularly with respect to foreign exchange because of
                        Iran’s assured income of 300 million dollars a year from oil revenues. I
                        went on to say that Turkish forces had been brought up to a high level
                        because of Turkey’s obligations under the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Treaty, that our military assistance to Turkey was being
                        reduced in order to give greater emphasis to economic aid. Although the Shah
                        understood all of this he gave no indication of agreeing with its logic.</p>
                    <p>At this point I told the Shah that the matter of economic and military
                        assistance to Iran was under active consideration in Washington and that I
                        was hopeful that within a short time I should be able to present him with a
                        comprehensive and balanced program. I added that it was my personal hope
                        that we should be able to consider a long-term program rather than the year
                        to year basis on which we have been proceeding in the past. The Shah said
                        that of course he would be anxious to receive a communication on this
                        subject but that he needed to know where he stood with regard to the
                        military within the next two weeks because it was necessary to establish the
                        1341 budget and a decision on this had to be made. I refrained from giving
                        him any estimate of when a program might be ready for a presentation to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>The Shah then expressed regret that he would not have an opportunity to
                        discuss these matters personally with the President before September and
                        speculated as to whether or not a private visit to Washington could be
                        arranged possibly with some desire of going to Canada. He felt that to seek
                        such an opportunity to talk with the President would not be humiliating to
                        him. This was said in a rather ruminating manner, without specifically
                        suggesting that such visit be undertaken. I rode him off of this and think
                        that he understands that it would not be possible for such a visit to
                        occur.</p>
                    <p>The audience ended with the Shah stating that he had come to his present
                        state of mind after great thought and examination of his conscience. That he
                        wanted it understood that no threat of blackmail was intended but that it
                        was his deep conviction that in order for the country to be secure and
                        progress, the only real stability lay in him and armed forces; that in order
                        for Iran to succeed he required a loyal army with good morale. Had cast his
                        lot with the West out of conviction and against the desire of many elements
                        in the country, he was correct in doing so and could not and would not
                        change although the Russians would no doubt respond to a gesture from him.
                        He would not do so in any circumstances; he looked to the West for support
                        not as a reward for a position he had taken but in deep belief that it was
                        necessary for him to <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0571"/>do so in the
                        interest of the nation. I reminded him that to abandon the country might
                        produce the same disastrous results as if he were to turn to the
                        Russians.</p>
                    <p>The substance of what the Shah told me this morning was substantially what he
                        said to Yatsevitch in the unpremeditated and casual meeting on the ski
                        slopes of Abe Ali, nor was it far from what he said to the British
                        Ambassador in the same circumstances. There was, however, less apparent
                        emotionalism and a more grim attitude than either <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> or Yatsevitch reported.</p>
                    <p>I think that he has done little else but to mull these problems over and that
                        there is no doubt that he has convinced himself that the position he has
                        taken is the correct one for him. I believe that he had not wanted to send
                        for me to tell me these things in the first instance that hence used the
                        device of talking to Yatsevitch and <persName corresp="#p_HSG1">Harrison</persName> when he had the opportunity at Abe Ali and by
                        sending the message he did send through the FonMin. He no doubt expected
                        that I would respond to this by asking to see him.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe that the Shah coldly set out with a calculated plan to make
                        our flesh creep in order to get what he wants from us but rather that he has
                        worked himself into a state of mind where his thoughts go round and round on
                        the same track, digging in deeper and deeper and making firmer his
                        convictions. I think that the principal explanation why he has done so is
                        that he isn’t in fact big enough for the job in hand. However, there is no
                        individual or element in Iran qualified to do the job and there probably
                        will not be for a number of years to come. We are faced here with a
                        situation where we are obliged to lean on a weak reed but I see no other one
                        on which we may rely to accomplish our objectives.</p>
                    <p>I have made several recommendations in my personal letter to <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> of March 4th and my airgram 241 of
                        March 5th. I hope that a combination of these proposals may be worked out
                        without delay in order that we may preclude some precipitous and
                        irresponsible act by the Shah. Although in his present mood he is capable of
                        committing one, I do not believe that he will do anything rash until he
                        hears from us again.<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">According to a record of

                        Proposed Approach to the Shah to achieve a reduction in force levels of
                        150,000 men, taking account of relevant political and economic factors.”</p>
                    <p>After a thorough review of the military, economic, and political aspects of
                        the Iranian situation, I have concluded that a shift in emphasis from the
                        Shah’s present preoccupation with military security to a situation where
                        requirements for economic and social development are reasonably in balance
                        with requirements for military security is likely to be successful only if
                        it includes the following three elements: (a) discussion with the Shah of an
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962–67 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> planning level which we believe should not exceed an
                        estimated $330 million (stated to the Shah in terms of equipment
                            programmed<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">See equipment list attached.
                            [Footnote in the source text. The attachment is not printed.]</note>
                        rather than in a dollar figure), contingent on agreement and implementation
                        of a phased reduction of his forces to 150,000; (b) a restatement by the
                        Ambassador of U.S. interest in the security of Iran and the general
                        assurances which U.S. deterrent power affords the area; (c) assurances and
                        evidence that the U.S. will be prepared to contribute substantially to the
                        Iranian Third Plan and will exert its influence on international
                        organizations and other friendly countries to do likewise, provided that the
                        Plan is sound, that it can be protected from unplanned impingement by
                        Iranian military expenditures so that the contributions of donors to
                        economic development will not be vitiated, and that significant measures of
                        “self-help” are in fact carried out by the Government of Iran.</p>
                    <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0573"/>
                    <p>The arguments in behalf of these conclusions can be summarized as follows:
                        The almost psychotic obsession of the Shah with the problem of his military
                        security is the overriding consideration in negotiating with him at the
                        present time. This concern is not without some basis in fact; and his sense
                        of isolation, I am persuaded, significantly affects his attitude toward the
                        security problem. <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> provides no
                        specific assurances of U.S. military support in case of aggression; Turkey
                        and Pakistan have both refused to obligate themselves to defend Iran in case
                        of aggression; the Shah’s bilateral agreement with the U.S. does not
                        persuade him that the U.S. can respond to aggression against Iran except at
                        the cost of total war; the Shah is concerned about the delivery of highly
                        sophisticated military equipment by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to Iraq and Afghanistan, and is also concerned with the
                        satellization of these countries.</p>
                    <p>In seeking to persuade the Shah to reduce his force levels to 150,000 men, I
                        believe it is essential that the interrelationship of military, economic,
                        and political factors be discussed. I think it should be made clear that
                        neither the United States nor Iranian resources are sufficient to provide
                        Iran with absolute security against all internal and external threats. What
                        we seek, therefore, is a balanced program which allocates human and
                        financial resources among various military, civil government, and economic
                        development needs most effectively and consistently within the limited
                        amounts available.</p>
                    <p>I have concluded that the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> planning level
                        of Iran for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962–67 should be no more than
                        the estimated $330 million referred to above. This figure somewhat exceeds
                        the Steering Group recommendation of a program of not more than $300 million
                        but, in my judgment, a useful concession to counter the Shah’s
                        preoccupations and to reduce the risk of an adverse response to an approach
                        to him suggesting a reduction in force levels and restraint on local defense
                        expenditures. The $330 million figure represents about $170 million of
                        modernization. The total also includes $41 million worth of items described
                        by the Defense Department as being “desirable” but not necessary from a
                        strictly military point of view and of lower priority than military
                        requirements elsewhere. On the other hand, I have eliminated $92 million of
                        modernization from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>’
                        total recommended program of $421 million. These figures should be viewed in
                        the light of the Shah’s desire for substantially more equipment than
                        recommended by the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>I have concluded that it is not feasible at the present time to make a
                        specific commitment to the Iranian Third Economic Development Plan, prior to
                        further review by the U.S. Government and by an international group in early
                        summer. We should, however, be prepared to promise general support in
                        general terms now, to participate in international consideration of the Plan
                        next summer, and to encourage other countries <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0574"/>to do likewise. Subsequent steps would depend, however,
                        upon the soundness of the Plan, the evidence of consistency of current civil
                        and military allocations with development needs, and the effectiveness with
                        which various “self-help” measures are carried out.</p>
                    <p>The content and final magnitude of the Third Plan are still being discussed.
                        In the absence of an Iranian assessment of the foreign exchange needs of the
                        whole economy for the Plan period, our own crude estimate is $1.2 billion.
                        This opens the prospect that during the course of the Plan Iran may be
                        seeking from one-third to one-half of this amount in the form of economic
                        aid from the U.S. The lower of these figures ($400 million) is about 25
                        percent above the projection for five and a half years of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 volume of U.S. economic assistance from
                        all sources.</p>
                    <p>Although we expect to obligate $40 to $60 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 for foreign exchange costs of projects in the Third
                        Plan, it is not thought advisable to indicate any level of U.S. long-term
                        economic commitment at this time, prior to international financing
                        discussions this summer. It is nonetheless desirable to give the Shah some
                        evidence of support for the Third Plan when discussing the military
                        assistance program. I am specifically recommending that we now indicate to
                        the Shah our willingness to give favorable consideration to an Iranian

                        regional development as well by making possible an alternative trade route
                        for Afghanistan. Such a move would also help to maintain a momentum of
                        economic development at the start of the new Plan period in September and
                        may have an appeal to the Shah.</p>

                                Iranian forces on the basis of a graduated reduction over two to

                    <p>The principal cause of the Shah’s resentment against the United States lies
                        in the quantity and quality of United States military assistance to Iran in
                        terms of cash and hardware. The decision of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> as to the future multi-year program is therefore of central
                        importance to the Shah’s attitude toward the United States and toward his
                        duty to continue as the monarch of his country. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> has objected strongly to the
                        Steering Group recommendations (Enclosure 5),<note n="6" xml:id="d209fn6"><ref target="#d172">Document 172</ref>.</note> and argues that his
                        much higher multi-year level is the minimum which can be counted on to keep
                        the Shah in a cooperative mood and to effect the manpower reduction, which
                        would have important and beneficial results in the internal political sphere
                        and in the future of Iran’s economic development program.</p>

                    <p>The inter-agency recommendation to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        (Enclosure 4) sets up a multi-year military program lying between the
                        Ambassador’s proposal and that of the Steering Group. We feel that the
                        recommendation for an approach to the Shah based on the $330 million program
                        should be accepted. Neither the military criteria for assistance to Iran nor
                        the availability of military aid funds would justify a larger program.
                        Moreover, a significantly larger military program would in our view
                        unbalance the relationship between military and economic development
                        expenses that is in Iran’s best interests at the present stage. However,
                        this approach cannot be expected to remove the Shah’s present doubts as to
                        the attitude of the United States toward him and the armed forces, nor will
                        it result in more than the Shah’s reluctantly agreeing to a manpower
                        reduction. For these reasons we recommend that the Shah be invited to make
                        an early visit to Washington where full discussion might have the result of
                        improving his state of mind.</p>
                    <p>The jointly agreed recommendation proposes that the Ambassador present our
                        approach to the Shah as quickly as possible, so that he would have absorbed
                        its meaning before his visit to the United States. This would be preferable
                        to either (a) presenting such an approach at the time of the Shah’s visit,
                        or (b) postponing its presentation until after his visit.<note n="7" xml:id="d209fn7">A March 22 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>

                    <p>Dear Bill: With the increasing concern both here and in Tehran about criminal
                        jurisdiction over American military personnel in Iran, our two Departments
                        are, as you know, drafting a joint instruction to the Embassy in Tehran.
                        Although the exact details of the instruction have not been completed, we
                        will probably suggest to the Iranians that all members of our military
                        missions in Iran be considered “administrative and technical personnel” as
                        defined in the recent Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Intercourse and
                            Immunities.<note n="1" xml:id="d210fn1">The joint State-Defense message,
                            sent to the Embassy in Tehran in telegram 626, March 17, conveyed the
                            text of a note responding to an Iranian Foreign Ministry note of
                            February 7 in which Iran had agreed to a 1-year extension for the
                            American Military Advisory Mission. The U.S. note conveyed U.S.
                            agreement to the extension and also proposed that the United States and
                            Iran reach an understanding covering the status of U.S. forces in Iran
                            along the lines described in Talbot’s letter printed here. (Ibid.,
                            611.887/3–1462)</note> If and when the Iranians accept this proposal,
                        criminal jurisdiction will in effect be given to the American
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p>We will be greatly relieved if some means of protection such as this can be
                        agreed upon. We know, however, Iran’s long history of suspicion about all
                        forms of foreign involvement, especially any involvement which seems to them
                        to be an infringement on Iranian sovereignty. Once it is agreed upon and
                        becomes public knowledge, this jurisdictional agreement will be considered
                        by some articulate Iranians as just such an infringement. We, therefore,
                        believe it is incumbent upon all Americans who will be protected by this
                        agreement to do everything possible to abide by Iranian laws. If we abide by
                        these laws as best we can now as well as after a jurisdictional agreement is
                        reached, we will have helped immensely in accomplishing two ends: to be able
                        to approach negotiations with the feeling that we have done all we can to
                        abide by the law and normal precautions and, secondly, to be able to
                        exercise our rights once agreement is reached without too much fear of
                        Iranian reactions.</p>
                    <p>In addition to normal careful driving practices, the requirement of a valid
                        driver’s license, and other accepted precautions, we believe that all
                        Americans in Iran must have adequate liability insurance. The absence of
                        such insurance is an invitation, at the least, to adverse publicity <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0580"/>and possibly to political
                        complications. The recent accident and confinement of Specialist 4th Class
                        Frederick E. L. Adams have brought to our attention the fact that <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> does not require liability
                        insurance for “official duty driving”. Adams’ errand, at the time of the
                        accident, seems to have fallen within that category.</p>
                    <p>We, however, do not believe that <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> regulations on insurance are in full agreement with
                        the spirit and intention of existing guidance from the Operations
                        Coordinating Board and instructions from the Embassy in Tehran. Although the
                            <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> guidance is only for “private motor
                        vehicles”, <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> personnel use
                        the official cars assigned to them for both official and private purposes
                        with no well-defined line between the two. Considering all of this, it is
                        our opinion that liability insurance should be required for all <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> drivers for all types of
                        driving. Adequate liability coverage is possible in Iran through individual
                        policies which could be arranged by each driver. Also, the possibility of a
                        master policy covering all military personnel operating motor vehicles both
                        on-duty and off-duty would be worth investigating. Whatever the means, I
                        hope full coverage can be arranged for all military personnel for all types
                        of driving. This, plus renewed emphasis on extremely “defensive” driving
                        habits, will be of real help in negotiating and later implementing a
                        jurisdictional agreement with Iran.<note n="2" xml:id="d210fn2">The U.S.

                                active central role and divert Arabs incipient awareness that they
                                will be on the losing end unless they take advantage of constructive

                                time to time it may become apparent that US representations can be

                    <p>Current unrest in Syria appears to stem from three principal sources, viz:
                        (1) The High Command of the Army which, while divided <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0583"/>within itself but dominated by anti-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> elements, is dissatisfied by the
                        performance of the recent civilian government; (2) Civilian politicians,
                        some of whom have a pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> propensity, who
                        are dissatisfied with Army intervention in civilian affairs; (3) Some young
                        Army officers and non-coms, students and some labor elements who are
                        generally pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In this connection it is pertinent to discuss the following contingencies: <list>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Communist Intervention</hi>: Because the Army
                                was largely purged of Communist officers during the period of the
                                union with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and because
                                Syrian Communists have been kept under strict control since the
                                Syrian secession, we believe the Communists, though capable of
                                contributing to some degree to existing unrest, are presently not in
                                a position to affect the basic situation materially. We believe the
                                danger of Communist takeover is out of the question for some time to
                                come and we should establish our policies on the basis that Syrian
                                unrest is due essentially to internal and inter-Arab quarrels. Only
                                if Israel or the West place heavy pressure on Syria is an early
                                resurgence of Communism likely.</item>

                                    contingency (but unlikely) to be considered is the growth of a
                                        pro-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> movement
                                    from within, aided and abetted by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> financially, by propaganda and through the
                                    operations of undercover agents to bring about a government more
                                    amenable to Cairo’s influence or possibly restoration of some
                                    form of unity between Syria and Egypt. Whereas this would not be
                                    an unmixed blessing (nor an unmixed advantage), such an
                                    eventuality would not impinge sufficiently on U.S. interests to
                                    justify the disadvantages of U.S. intervention.</p>
                                <p>From observation of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> behavior
                                    during the Syrian revolt in September and the recent crisis, we
                                    believe external intervention by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is unlikely. There would appear to be a
                                    possibility of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> armed
                                    intervention only if an internal pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> movement had grown to proportions where success
                                    or failure might depend on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                                    military support and where such support could be given at
                                    negligible risk to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, e.g.
                                    under conditions where large areas of the country, including the
                                    principal port at Latakia and the principal airports, were in
                                        pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> hands, a separatist
                                        pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> regime was
                                    established calling for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                                    intervention. If there should appear to be a clear
                                        likeli<persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> of overt
                                        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> military intervention,
                                    we believe action should be taken through diplomatic channels
                                    (only as a last resort in the United Nations, preferably by an
                                    Arab country) to discourage such intervention. However, we
                                    believe a direct confrontation of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and US military forces should not be
                                    contemplated on view of (a) the benefits to the Soviets of such
                                    a policy; (b) the absence of sufficient US stake in Syria to
                                    justify such a drastic measure; <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0584"/>and (c) the general desirability of avoiding
                                    direct US intervention in inter-Arab affairs in the absence of a
                                    significant element of Communist troublemaking.</p></item>

                                as well as fastening on the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, by extension, responsibility for Jordan’s action.

                                that as non-Arab powers such intervention would be considered
                                aggression, would be productive only of harm, would reflect
                                adversely on us, and would strengthen the Soviet position. In their

                                Israel’s interest, we tend to doubt that Israel would use force to
                                try to prevent Syrian union or federation with another Arab

                        correctness of this policy is strengthened by the observation that, if left
                        to themselves, the Syrians and other Arab peoples are generally able to find
                        a modus vivendi which avoids direct hostilities between Arab and Arab. In
                        the absence of serious Israeli or Western pressure the Syrians (and Arabs
                        generally) are capable of successful resistance to Communist attempts to
                        exploit situations of unrest.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he had discussed with appropriate officials in the British
                        and French Foreign Ministries his general ideas about “the second round”
                        (Sir <persName corresp="#p_SSRB1">Roger Stevens</persName> and
                            <persName>Stewart Crawford</persName> in London, Sauvagnargues and
                        Vincenot in Paris). None of these officials were optimistic, but there was
                        some feeling that perhaps limited movement to break the present stalemate is
                        a possibility. All were interested and proffered cooperation. One impression
                        gained in Paris is that Foreign Ministry officials are much less keen on
                        close relations with Israel than are officials in other sections of the
                        French Government. One French official remarked that the threat to terminate
                            <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> is the only lever which will
                        mean anything to the Arabs. Dr. Johnson said he had pleasant but not
                        particularly fruitful meetings with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SPP3">Spinelli</persName> and officials of the <gloss target="#t_UNHCR1">UNHCR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICEM1">ICEM</gloss> in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson said, following his return from Europe, <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> had been helpful in arranging meetings for him with Mr.
                        Label Katz, President, B’nai B’rith, Rabbi Irving Miller, President of the
                        Conference of Presidents, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GDN1">Nahum
                            Goldmann</persName>. All had agreed to be helpful in arranging
                        extra-official contacts in Israel. All had interesting comments to make
                        regarding probable future immigration. Although these estimates were arrived
                        at separately, they are virtually identical. From sources other than the
                        Soviet Union (Rumania, Hungary, Morocco, and Algeria), Israel can expect a
                        maximum of 250,000 immigrants in the next few years. Barring the rise of
                        another Stalin, no more than 500,000 of Russia’s Jewish population of
                        approximately three million would consider leaving even if they were allowed
                        to do so. It is a fact that most <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0586"/>younger Jews in the Soviet Union are assimilated. From these calculations,
                        it appears that the maximum possible immigration into Israel over the next
                        decade is 750,000 persons. Dr. Johnson said the three Jewish leaders had
                        pointed to the impossibility of Israel’s placing any voluntary restrictions
                        on immigration. All had agreed, however, that Israel’s continued harping on
                        the expectation of extensive immigration is unhelpful.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he has assured <persName corresp="#p_GDN1">Goldmann</persName>, Katz, and Miller that he is going to Israel to
                        explore the significance of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>’s statement that “we do not preclude some repatriation
                        under suitable circumstances”. He is very much aware of the considerations
                        of sovereignty and security which affect the thinking of Israel’s leaders.
                        He had assured the Jewish leaders that as a <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> official he could not seek to infringe on these.</p>

                        “unsatisfactory”. This was paralleled by an approach to Assistant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>. It was agreed that these
                        representations were “for the record” and the Israelis have little real
                        grounds for complaint since the text of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>’s proposed announcement was forwarded to <persName corresp="#p_CMS1">Comay</persName> on February 28 and he acquiesced in
                        its wording. Dr. Johnson said he intended to talk to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CMS1">Comay</persName> to “mollify” him for Jerusalem’s
                        benefit.</p>
                    <p>It was also noted that the Israelis had made parallel approaches to Assistant
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> in Washington and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> in New York regarding the
                        dangers of the Special Representative’s talking to self-proclaimed refugee

                        with governments” in the Special Representative’s official capacity and what

                        the nature of proposals he might make to governments. Dr. Johnson pointed
                        out that two differing approaches had been suggested in Working Papers I and

                        Paper I envisages the Special Representative’s obtaining a commitment as to
                        the parties’ agreement in principle to cooperate in moving a specified,
                        limited number of refugees (perhaps ten or twenty thousand) in a one year
                        period. The commitment would include an agreed system for determining
                        refugee preferences. Working Paper III looks to a system of open-ended
                        registration. Commitments from governments would not be necessary as the
                            <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> would undertake only to do its best
                        to obtain government cooperation in implementing refugee preferences. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWRJ1">Crawford</persName> pointed out the several
                        tentative conclusions which evolved in discussion of the Working Papers
                        within the Department. In brief, these seem to point to the desirability of
                        dealing with a fixed, small number in the initial period. There appear
                        disadvantages to any sort of open-ended registration or census. (Respective
                        views on this very fundamental question were discussed at length. In the
                        end, Dr. Johnson said his own thinking is close to that of the Department
                        and he, therefore, leans to the type of limited-movement-in-a-limited-period
                        approach outlined in Working Paper I. There are, however, some elements of
                        value in Working Paper III. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName>
                        was asked by Dr. Johnson to prepare a synthesis of the best elements of I
                        and III, in one page outline, for consideration by Dr. Johnson and the
                        Department.) It was further agreed that any approach, to succeed, must be
                        (a) simple, (b) in strict accord with the principles of Paragraph 11, (c)
                        based on obtaining Arab government acquiescence rather than active
                        cooperation, and (d) designed to minimize political vulnerability from the
                        point of view of the several governments concerned.</p>

                            “or” (Compensation):</hi></p>
                    <p>There was detailed discussion of the long-standing U.S. Government position
                        that, insofar as <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> “responsibility” is
                        concerned, Paragraph 11 is predicated on the provision of compensation only
                        to those refugees who choose resettlement. The Working Papers had revealed
                        that the staff of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> Secretariat and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> held that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> itself should ensure the payment of
                        (property) compensation to repatriated refugees. When Department officers
                        noted, inter alia, the unlikeli<persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName>
                        <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0588"/>of Israel’s accepting this thesis,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> commented that if Israel
                        refused, more pressure would develop against it for its intransigence. Dr.
                        Johnson, however, tentatively concurred with the Department’s view that the
                        option should lie between guaranteed compensation (where applicable) if the
                        refugee chose resettlement, or repatriation with no <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> commitment on compensation. The idea of granting
                        compensation for moveable property was discouraged by the Department
                        officers on the grounds that claims would be virtually impossible to
                        adjudicate and that some sort of per capita “rehabilitation” or
                        “reintegration” allowance would obviate the need for such compensation.<note n="3" xml:id="d213fn3">After the formal meeting Mr. Palmer suggested to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> that, quite apart from
                            the legal aspects and negotiating history of the “and-or” question, the
                            “or” concept should prevail from the viewpoint of political realism. If
                            the refugees were promised compensation with repatriation, would any
                            even opt for resettlement? In order to obtain a reasonable proportion
                            between those opting for repatriation and those opting for resettlement
                            (and Israel would agree to no scheme in which repatriation would
                            predominate), the experiences of the first phase operation would have to
                            be such as to convince the refugees that resettlement was preferable to
                            repatriation. [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>

                    <p>Department officers noted that there is tentative agreement on the Working
                        Papers’ premise that there must be some financial arrangement to give the
                        refugees a new start in whatever area they move. Here, important questions
                        are: (a) what is an equitable amount per refugee (a figure of $2,400 per
                        family of four was tentatively mentioned), (b) what portion, if any, should
                        be paid to the refugees and what to the receiving government, and (c) what
                        voice, if any, should the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> have in

                    <p>Department officers noted that this problem had been carefully but not
                        definitively considered in several working group meetings in the Department.
                        As a matter of history, the U.S. has expressed willingness to give generous
                        support to programs that offer prospect of real progress on aspects of the
                        Arab-Israel problem. The willingness to seek legislative authority for such
                        support continues today. The Department is anxious that Dr. Johnson have in
                        hand the tools he requires to make his mission effective. The assurance of
                        adequate financial support for projects that might be agreed upon is
                        obviously of great importance. As far as a United States Government
                        assurance is concerned, two types of approach might be envisaged, for use
                        singly or in combination: (a) an executive statement of willingness, in
                        principle, to assist, but in an unspecified amount, and (b) a specific
                        commitment to more limited support in a given period. Before either can be
                        undertaken, an indication of what Dr. Johnson desires is required. Relevant
                        to this problem is the <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0589"/>United

                    <p>Department officers noted the consensus of the working group that during the

                        from one country to another, thus reducing administrative problems; the

                        proportional to the percentage in each country of the total refugee
                        population; the need to inform the refugees of the facts (of life in
                        Israel), but to do this insofar as possible by providing straight answers to
                        questions rather than volunteering information in a way that would subject
                        the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> to accusations of trying to

                        but they might assent to the Special Representative’s announcing their

                    <p>Department officers explained the fears expressed in the Department’s working
                        group regarding too early an appeal for refugee resettlement opportunities
                        outside the Near East. It seems desirable that no move be made by the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> in this direction until at least

                        appeal to governments to help out. Again hypothetically, the U.S. could
                        respond to this appeal by an appropriate executive announcement of intent to
                        seek authority from Congress for a special refugee quota.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Johnson said one of the obstacles to Arab cooperation in an effort to
                        solve the refugee problem is the real fear of continued large-scale
                        immigration into Israel and, consequently, of an Israel move to expand. It
                        was agreed that the philosophy of unrestricted Jewish immigration is so
                        fundamental to the State of Israel that it is not realistic to expect that
                        the Israel Government would ever agree to restrict this. Perhaps, however,
                        there might be less public emphasis by Israel on unrestricted immigration.
                        Additionally, the Special Representative can perhaps informally convey to
                        Arab leaders the best current estimates of probable future immigration to
                        Israel.</p>

                        with Dr. Johnson. Dr. Johnson acknowledged, for example, that he had not yet
                        had an opportunity to give careful study to Working Paper III. On several
                        issues, Dr. Johnson’s thinking seemed much closer to that of the

                        few instances, he took fairly sharp exception. Department officers felt (and
                        Dr. Johnson later so indicated privately to <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>) that Dr. Johnson’s thinking about negotiating approaches
                        and tactics in the “second round” is still quite fluid and that he was most

                    <p>This memorandum answers your question: “Does the Shah of Iran have any basis
                        for contending that Iran is being discriminated against in the Military
                        Assistance Program in comparison with Turkey and Pakistan?”</p>
                    <p>It is difficult to compare these three countries as their situations and
                        needs are quite different, as well as the fact that U.S. military aid to
                        Turkey and Pakistan has the indirect effect of enhancing Iran’s security as
                        they are all members of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0592"/>
                    <p>Turkey has received much more military assistance and more modern equipment
                        than either of the other two countries. It is a member of both <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, which gives us a double return on our assistance. It
                        stands astride three traditional routes from Russia to the Middle East: The
                        Thracian Plain; the Black Sea; and the Caucasus. It has much larger and more
                        effective armed forces than Iran, which can absorb considerable equipment,
                        and has been in a position to offer us more quid pro quo in the way of
                        sensitive installations, air bases, etc. The attached table sets forth the
                        relative amounts and types of equipment which all three countries have
                        received.</p>
                    <p>Our military aid to Pakistan, however, is much more comparable to that
                        received by Iran. It has received roughly the same amount of equipment, and
                        roughly the same proportion of modern equipment. However, it has received a
                        few “glamour” items (F–104’s for example) which Iran has not. Actually,
                        Pakistan has been receiving military assistance only since 1954, so their
                        annual rate has been higher. The Pakistani armed forces, being based on a
                        fairly solid core of British training, were able to absorb this equipment
                        more rapidly than the Iranian armed forces. However, the Pakistani forces
                        are, at this stage, fairly well equipped, and it is expected that their
                        annual military assistance program levels will drop below those of Iran in
                        the future.</p>
                    <p>There is no factual basis for a claim of discrimination against Iran. There
                        is a difference of view, however, between ourselves and the Iranians in that
                        the United States gives more weight to the requirement for real economic
                        progress than does the Iranian government. The Iranians, understandably,
                        would favor the best of both worlds—more modern military aid and more
                        economic assistance.</p>

                    <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> told
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> that we had watched
                        with increasing dismay the recent Israel-Syrian clashes on Lake Tiberias
                        culminating in Israel’s retaliatory raid on Syrian gun positions March
                            16–17.<note n="1" xml:id="d216fn1">For a report on the raid, see <ref target="#d226">Document 226</ref>. Reports from the Embassies in Tel
                            Aviv and Damascus concerning the incidents are in Department of State,
                            Central File 683.84A. On March 17, the Department of State instructed
                            the Embassy in Damascus (telegram 383) and the Embassy in Tel Aviv
                            (telegram 547) to seek a meeting at the ministerial-level to counsel
                            restraint and urge full cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>. (Ibid., 324.84/3–1762)</note> He reminded the
                        Ambassador that in a recent conversation the latter had asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> what effect uneasiness and tensions
                        in Syria might have on the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> mission to
                        Jordan and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_JJE1">Joseph Johnson</persName>’s
                        forthcoming visit to the Middle East as Special Representative of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>. He said he is convinced that events of the
                        past weekend have probably hurt the prospects of the two missions a great
                        deal more than anything that may have gone before. While not yet informed of
                            <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> findings in the conflict, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said, he is aware that the
                        Israel Government considered itself under considerable provocation. For the
                        first time in several years Israel has crossed international frontiers and
                        applied force of much greater magnitude than that directed against Israel.
                        He said he is certain the Israelis are aware that regardless of the
                        provocation under which Israel acted, the United States continues very much
                        opposed to the employment of such raids.</p>
                    <p>The raid might not chasten the Syrians. In view of the Syrian Government’s
                        uncertainty as to its strength, it might react unpredictably in a very
                        violent manner. Hoping to forestall this possibility, the U.S. has already
                        spoken to the Syrians at the highest level, urging them to consider the
                        military phase of the dispute as closed, and to cooperate fully with <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0595"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said he did not want to
                        over-emphasize the importance of the situation, but nevertheless believes it
                        has the seeds of very serious disturbances. The modus vivendi of the past
                        few years is threatened, and it is difficult not to recall the tragedies of
                        1956 and 1958 and the problems they created for all principles.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> expressed gratitude
                        for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>’s views, but said he
                        wished to react immediately, which he did with vigor. He said that at least
                        ten days ago the Department had been apprised of the gravity with which
                        Israel regarded the worsening situation on the lake, which he described as
                        100% in Israel’s territory—the whole lake and its shore.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM3">Ludlow</persName> interposed an objection,
                        informing the Ambassador that the United States does not accept this Israel
                        assumption of unlimited sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>Remarking that he would return to this question later, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said the Syrians had broken the peace
                        repeatedly from the beginning of February molesting Israel fishermen
                        pursuing their tasks on the lake. Each time, he said, the Israelis had gone
                        to <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>, suggesting that it should
                        arrange for additional <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> observation posts
                        in the troubled area for better surveillance and control of the problem. He
                        enumerated a number of violations: February 1 and 7—rifle fire directed at
                        Israel fishermen; February 10—machine gun and rifle fire; February
                        15—machine gun fire against fishermen; February 25—machine gun fire directed
                        at Israel police patrol; and February 27 and March 7—machine gun fire.</p>
                    <p>On March 8, according to the Ambassador, the Syrians made use for the first
                        time of recoilless rifles, bringing a turning point in Israel’s appraisal of
                        its security problem. In any rational military establishment, according to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>, a recoilless rifle
                        is fired only on order from a military command. The Israelis could only
                        infer either that anarchy prevails in the Syrian units situated above the
                        lake or the recoilless rifles were put into play by direction of the
                        Government of Syria. At that time, the Israelis summoned <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> representatives and asked that they
                        convey to the Syrian Government in Damascus Israel’s opinion that the
                        Syrians were playing with fire.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> suggested that instead of
                        using <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> to send messages the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> machinery might have been brought into
                        use.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that for weeks
                        the Israelis had watched the Syrians strengthening their positions
                        overlooking Tiberias. The situation remained very serious. United States
                        concern is shared by the Government of Israel. A special meeting of the
                        cabinet “this morning” had considered the implications of another artillery
                        attack on an Israel <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0596"/>police boat
                        1,000 meters out on the lake in which two policemen had been wounded.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the defense of Israel’s use of reprisal raids, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that in quality and
                        implication there is no difference between shooting or walking across a
                        border. Israel can only regard gunfire as an act of aggression or war, and
                        its defense against such acts is dictated by the military logic of Israel’s
                        situation. Israel’s repeated appeals to the United Nations and the Secretary
                        General have not produced a solution. Israel is as reluctant as anyone else
                        to see the circumstances of 1956 reproduced, but for Israel to have its
                        citizens and settlements under fire is an intolerable situation which the
                        United Nations had been unable to correct.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> commented that corrective
                        efforts had been begun. The United States has been in close touch with the
                        United Nations and had appealed to the Syrians to make full use of <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> facilities, which are in the locality for
                        the express purpose of correcting violations of the Armistice Agreements.
                        The United States is very much afraid that the Near East may be trembling on
                        the brink of a return to 1956 and the misfortune which it brought to all
                        parties.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> added that the Israelis
                        undoubtedly have labored under serious provocations. However, experience
                        does not establish that this kind of reprisal is the way to deal with the
                        problem. Similar efforts in the past have not always turned out as planned.
                        Violence invites violent responses and greater violence still.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that if Israel
                        is put into a situation in which it is obliged to deal directly with a
                        threat to its security, the problems of defense become objective and
                        technical. Syrian guns commanded the entire lake and adjoining settlements.
                        When it was decided to clean them out, the troops could not be sent out
                        without the tools required.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> asked rhetorically if the
                        Israelis, should the shooting continue, be tempted to take and occupy the
                        high ground, which might produce a united Arab reaction?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said all that is
                        necessary is for the Syrians to stop shooting. He attempted to draw an
                        analogy between Israel’s retaliation and U.S. involvement in South Viet-Nam,
                        where the U.S. is steadily “escalating” its involvement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> pointed out there is considerable
                        difference in the two controversies. No frontiers have been crossed in
                        Viet-Nam. As in Malaya, it is a matter of subduing guerrillas within a
                        state.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, according to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>, the Syrians have got to be persuaded to stop
                        shooting. The Israelis can live with threats and taunts and also can live
                        with the fact that Arab doctrine still considers <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0597"/>that a state of war prevails. Israel has long ceased to
                        hope for an early relaxation of Arab attitudes but it is not prepared to
                        tolerate being made a target.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> agreed that the fighting
                        must be brought to a stop, but he could not accept Israel’s use of
                        retaliatory raids.</p>
                    <p>The conversation concluded with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> repeating that he would report the Department’s views
                        to his Government but make clear he did not accept the Department’s thesis,
                        nor expect his Government to.<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">The Department of
                            State transmitted a summary of this conversation to the Embassies in Tel
                            Aviv, Damascus, and several other Near Eastern and European posts in
                            circular telegram 1594, March 20. The Department instructed the Embassy
                            in Tel Aviv to seek another meeting with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>, “stressing in particular: Our deep

                    <p>2412. Tiberias Incidents. For <gloss target="#t_USUN1"><hi rend="italic">USUN</hi></gloss>: We understand Syrians have requested an early
                        meeting of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, and that Israelis are
                        preparing counter-complaint. Re timing, if cease fire were being
                        scrupulously observed we believe there would be advantage to await <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> report and Chief-of-Staff
                        recommendations before <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> convened.
                        (Tentatively Syrians thinking in terms of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                        meeting sometime next week.) If violations of cease fire recur, however,
                        earlier meeting of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> may be required to
                        assist in averting serious escalation hostilities.</p>
                    <p>With renewal of exchange fire on Lake Tiberias reported this morning, Dept
                        fears recurrence last week’s retaliatory raid by Israelis. Our <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0598"/>assessment Syrian feelings leads us to
                        believe Israeli raid has been wholly unsuccessful in intimidating Syrians
                        and that a steady escalation of incidents is distinct possibility.
                        Therefore, we wish be sure no step is overlooked which might help pacify
                        situation. For example, Dept has called in Israeli Ambassador and Syrian
                        Chargé today to urge restraint and cooperation with <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>. Mission requested do same with
                        respective Dels. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. It is premature to
                        determine whether res in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would be
                        desirable. If efforts <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> mechanism, supplemented by appropriate
                        bilateral representations, prove successful in maintaining cease fire, it
                        might be possible and desirable to limit <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                        consideration to statements by parties concerned and <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members with view developing as broad a “consensus or

                    <dateline><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1962-03-23" calendar="gregorian">March 23, 1962</date>.</dateline>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> pointed out that the Shah
                        was highly emotional and was particularly disturbed by what he thought to be
                        our inclination toward being more generous to neutrals than to our allies.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that we very much
                        need the Shah in the next few years. We need an increasingly reformist
                        government in Iran and a controlled revolution there. Our primary task
                        during the Shah’s visit will be to reassure Iran, and specifically the Shah.
                        Uppermost in the Shah’s mind is the Iranian Military establishment. He feels
                        that the US has no deterrent in the event of a Soviet attack on Iran. Our
                        job is to convey to the Shah the US concept of global military strategy and
                        of Iran’s place in this overall picture, attempting to convince him of the
                        need for reductions and improvement of his armed forces.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> pointed out that three
                        recommendations had been made with regard to the aid level in Iran. The
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJC1">Kitchen</persName> Committee recommended a
                        Multi-year program of $300 million dollars. State-Defense and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> have agreed on a Multi-year program of $330
                        million. <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> recommends a program of $420 million, which he
                        insists is essential to prevent the Shah’s abdication. The
                            State-Defense-<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> recommendations are on
                        the President’s desk now. The President has deferred any decision until he
                        has had a chance to speak with the Ambassador. The major difference between
                        the $430 million and the $330 million program is the Shah’s desire for a
                        sophisticated anti-aircraft defense system. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> pointed out that our military has no formal place for
                        Iran in our War planning. The Shah definitely feels that he should have such
                        a role. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> in Defense is
                        working on a paper that will endeavor to convince the Shah of the
                        credibility of our global deterrent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> stressed the importance of being able to say to the
                        Shah that we are committed to defend Iran and have a significant capacity to
                        do so. For, he pointed out, only if we can convince him of this can we
                        proceed to talk to him rationally about his own forces. We must, said Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, convince our military to
                        make this notion credible to the Shah. He suggested in this connection that
                        the Shah be invited to see for himself <gloss target="#t_STRAC1">
                            <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0600"/>STRAC</gloss> forces in a
                        demonstration of their capability, and that he be told that these forces are
                        earmarked for the defense of such countries as Iran. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> emphasized that we can no longer
                        stall the Shah; that this has been a blind, corrosive and dishonest
                        dialogue. He agreed to the importance of having our military talk to the
                        Shah about the <gloss target="#t_STRAC1">STRAC</gloss> forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said that we view a Soviet attack on
                        Iran as an unlikely contingency; that in the event of such an attack
                        hostilities could probably not be confined solely to Iran; and we have units
                        committed to defend Iran in such an unlikely eventuality. The criteria, he
                        said, for the Iranian forces should be: A) an effective internal defense
                        force; B) possessing a high civic action component; and C) able to fulfill
                        some useful role in connection with the arrival of <gloss target="#t_STRAC1">STRAC</gloss> forces. He said that the Shah’s criteria for these forces
                        were: A) Ability to sustain his throne within Iran; B) to provide the best
                        possible defense against Soviet attack; and C) to provide a capability to
                        take on Iraq and Afghanistan at the same time.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> stressed the importance of conveying to the Shah our
                        view that the main threat to Iran is now an internal one. He said that the
                        Third Plan seems to have broken down and that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> recommends against giving the Shah specific <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> figures now. The real problem he said is
                        one of organization and intent, not one of money. The Iranians seem to be
                        afraid to make decisions and there is a very real need to talk toughly to
                        the Shah. We must talk to him about our overall relations, not just about
                        military needs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> felt
                        strongly that our program should be put to the Shah when he is here and he
                        asked that <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">W. Bundy</persName> be pushed to
                        produce a convincing paper on our military policy before the Shah’s arrival
                        so that we can work towards joint military planning with Iran.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> asked Messrs. Talbot,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to accompany him at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Standing Group Meeting.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> suggested the possibility
                        of joint planning exercises for the defense of Iran. It was pointed out,
                        however, that joint planners would probably create a demand for still
                        greater military expenditures. Therefore, the suggestion was rejected. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said that he was
                        becoming quite sympathetic with the Shah. Everyone agreed that the Shah had
                        no real defense against Soviet attack.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that the Shah should be given a briefing on <gloss target="#t_STRAC1">STRAC</gloss> potentialities (by Lt. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_QLGWW1">Quinn</persName>). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> is to look into this. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> said, however, that Iran was
                        the one place to which the <gloss target="#t_STRAC1">STRAC</gloss> forces
                        were not really applicable. He therefore felt badly about such a briefing,
                        given the fact that we are “not about to send our two <gloss target="#t_STRAC1">STRAC</gloss> divisions into Iran.”</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> said that the real
                        dangers of the <hi rend="italic">Shah</hi>’s visit would be the questions he
                        would probably ask: such as, How do your troops get in? and What about the
                        prepositioning of equipment? He pointed out that it would be difficult to
                        come up with any credible plan. He asked what “degree of phoniness” we could
                        get away with. It was also pointed out that Iran’s 1921 Treaty with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would cause difficulties with the
                        prepositioning of any equipment.</p>
                    <p>No real conclusions were reached concerning the presentation of a plan to the
                        Shah, but <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> was
                        nevertheless to try to come up with a paper by next Wednesday or Thursday
                        which would convince the Shah of the credibility of the US deterrent and of
                        our ability to come to the aid of Iran.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out by <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>
                        that merely convincing the <hi rend="italic">Shah</hi> of our strategic
                        superiority would not be sufficient. What kind of assurances can we give the
                        Shah? It was concluded that Gen. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>’s statements at the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> conference in March 1961<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2">See

                            meeting.</note> represented just about the limit of what we could say
                        and that the President will probably be unable to do more than simply repeat
                        Gen. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>’s commitment made at
                        that time.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> are to see the President on Friday
                        and take a draft talking paper with them.</p>
                    <p>It was also decided that the Pentagon would give the Shah a briefing on our
                        assessment of the Iraq-Afghanistan potential (which is considerably lower
                        than the Shah’s assessment thereof). It was decided that the overall US
                        Program for Iran should be presented to the Shah while <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0603"/>he is here (or at least enough of it to
                        reveal to him the “bad news” aspect thereof).</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is still unwilling to make a specific
                        dollar commitment to the Third Plan. They insist on prior pressure.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> pointed out that a
                        Soviet attack on Iran would not be “so damned unlikely” if the Soviets find
                        out about this kind of thinking. It was reluctantly concluded that the hard
                        military facts made a bunch of dreams of <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>’s
                        desires, to reassure the Shah. It was also pointed out that this sort of
                        military thinking put us on a collision course with Gen. Norstad with regard
                        to supporting assistance to Greece.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that the Shah would be given a general outline of the <gloss target="#t_AID1">Aid</gloss> Program.</p>

                    <p>Primary problem is to distinguish between <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss>’s ostensible objectives and its real objectives.
                        Ostensible objective of its note of March 22<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">The
                            Syrian Government delivered copies of its lengthy note, which described
                            in detail Israel’s transgressions against Syria, to representatives of
                            the Arab states and Security Council member states in Damascus on March
                            22. The Embassy transmitted a translation of the note to the Department
                            of State in telegram 597 from Damascus, March 23. (Ibid.,
                            683.84A/3–2362)</note> is induce <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to
                        compel Israel to comply with partition and refugee resolutions, on pain of
                        expulsion. Some Arab officials here, like Saudi Ambassador, naively profess
                        to believe that, since Israel failed live up to conditions of its admission
                        to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, Secretary General should take routine
                        police action of barring Israeli representatives from further meetings.
                        Others speculate <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> vote would be
                        required.</p>
                    <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0604"/>
                    <p>We believe, however, Prime Minister Dawalibi and most high-level <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> officials too realistic even to dream of
                        so unlikely a prospect as Israel’s being expelled. In fact Cabinet Secretary
                        General Mahayiri cited for us cases of states that have defied <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions with impunity— notably <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in its Suez Canal policy.</p>
                    <p>Is then <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss>’s belligerent stance of
                        irrevocable opposition to Israeli diversion a propaganda tactic to counter
                        Cairo’s charges that imperialism dominates Syria? If so, <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> policy is bankrupt before it starts; it
                        will be only matter of time before Israel begins pumping and <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> stands, like Qasim before Kuwait,
                        stripped of pretense to a sound foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>In Embassy’s view, however, <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> policy
                        toward Israel has more substance than Qasim’s toward Kuwait and consequently
                        holds more danger for Middle East peace.</p>
                    <p>We believe sequence of events cited in reference telegram bears out our
                        suspicion, stated in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 583,<note n="3" xml:id="d221fn3">Dated March 20. (Ibid., 684A.85322/3–2062)</note>
                        that <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> does not want to consider Lake
                        Tiberias incidents reasonably and in isolation—that instead their purpose
                        and strategy is to focus all their efforts on Jordan waters and somehow to
                        secure indefinite postponement of Israeli diversion and resultant
                        “strengthening of the enemy.”</p>
                    <p>In this connection, we take Dawalibi’s bald statement of March 22 (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 593)<note n="4" xml:id="d221fn4">Dated March 22. (Ibid., 683.84A/3–2262)</note> that he wants USG to
                        take public position against unilateral Israel diversion as corroboration of
                        second thesis presented <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 583—that
                        USG is prime target of present <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> foreign
                        policy campaign.</p>
                    <p>Embassy sees this campaign as two-pronged. On one hand, by private statements
                        and judicious placement of news stories, <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> is suggesting that penalty for US inflexibility on Jordan
                        waters would be destruction US position in Middle East, advancement of
                        Soviet causes therein, and risk of Arab-Israeli war.</p>
                    <p>On other hand, by taking issue to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on
                        “legal” grounds, <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> probably seeking
                        provide USG with face-saving means for modifying its Palestine policy. We
                        understand <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss>’s March 22 note was
                        conceived by Dawalibi and drafted by Syria’s reputedly pro-Soviet expert on
                        law and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, Salah Tarazi. We suspect they
                        hope US will espouse their case, not because US is enchanted with its legal
                        precision, but because it offers least embarrassing alternative to Middle
                        East chaos.</p>
                    <p>While we are first to sense disingenuousness of <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss>’s artifices and strategy, we are nevertheless genuinely
                        concerned on two major counts: <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0605"/>

                                unreasonably—to Arabs will be vetoed by Soviets. Net result would be
                                that substantive situation would find itself unchanged except with
                                Soviets popular heroes and US in doghouse.</item>

                            <gloss target="#t_GAA1">GAA</gloss> drawn up that Syrians would retire
                        beyond these international boundaries. Question of sovereignty raised
                        tangentially in Security Council late in 1955, he said, but Israeli
                        sovereignty not challenged by anyone but Syrians at that time and British
                        and French delegates both stated emphatically in January 1956 that Lake
                        Tiberias within Israel.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> then commented that Israeli
                        sovereignty over lake had not been questioned before except by Syrians and
                        Israeli gravest concern now raised by US bringing matter to fore. Should
                        Syrians sense any hesitation in US point of view relative to Israeli
                        sovereignty over lake, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>
                        believed trouble would then really begin and Syria could be expected in
                        those circumstances abandon principles underlying
                            <persName>Johnston</persName> plan, overthrow <gloss target="#t_GAA1">GAA</gloss>, and perhaps resort to more serious measures. It should
                        [be] clearly understood Israel did not plan to abandon in whole or in any
                        part its claims over the lake. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was not
                        disposed to obtain peace and quiet in area by permitting a chip of Israel to
                        be broken off there. Jews were given nothing in Israel, she claimed, but
                        bought the land with blood or money. As a consequence, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wanted Israel as it stood; peace and quiet
                        in area not worth any invasion or diminution of Israeli sovereignty in any
                        way. Normally, it was said, this question would have been raised in
                        Washington but <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> now in Israel so
                        matter discussed here. To emphasize importance <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> attaches to subject, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> informed me she had interrupted full and heavy schedule
                        attendant upon current visit of Swedish Prime Minister to raise matter with
                        me.</p>
                    <p>I noted that I did not have benefit of any minutes on <persName corresp="#p_LJM3">Ludlow</persName>-Israeli conversation and hence could
                        not comment directly. Israelis had made statement of sovereignty, however,
                        in their complaint to the Security Council and sovereignty was legal
                        concept. As Department was working on all aspects of problem to prepare its
                        position in the debate, legal facet also had to be considered and US motives
                        should not be suspect merely because legal point raised. I was sure, I
                        continued, Department wished reasonable solution to matter, but in view of
                        expressed Israeli amazement and worry over point of view expressed in
                        Department, I would endeavor ascertain Department’s thinking.</p>

                        In these circumstances, US objectives in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                        should be: (a) give maximum support to maintenance cease-fire; (b)

                        machinery and <persName corresp="#p_VHMGCC1">von Horn</persName>’s position.
                        We do not intend to acquiesce in <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>’s
                        relentlessly pursued, long-term program of eroding <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> authority. On other hand, Syria must be made to realize
                        it cannot with impunity pour gunfire on Israelis legitimately fishing in

                        approach <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Ghana. Also you may wish

                    <p>We recognize US under considerable pressures from both sides in this case,
                        and that these pressures will mount as text of res crystallizes. Arabs will
                        insist as minimum on outright condemnation rather than merely deploring
                        Israeli raid, while <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will undoubtedly
                        resist any condemnation and insist at minimum reference to Israeli

                            April)</hi></p>
                    <p>Since the Shah’s visit will be a particularly delicate exercise in
                        reassurance, we suggest at least two prior strategy sessions with you. The
                        first would be this Friday to get your preliminary reactions and another
                        next week when <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> will be back.
                        For background, you should read the attached.<note n="1" xml:id="d224fn1">The attachments described in this memorandum were not attached to the
                            source text, but are ibid.</note></p>
                    <p>While the Shah is much bucked up by earlier visit, he’ll probably still
                        insist on ventilating his military concerns. Our proposed strategy is to
                        soften him up first by taking the initiative with a forthright
                        confidence-building portrayal of continued US strategic superiority and our
                        growing general purpose strength (we’d like your reactions to draft State
                        talking points at Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">Tab A is a 14-page
                            talking paper, prepared by the Department of State and transmitted to
                            the White House under cover of a copy of a March 28 memorandum from
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>.</note></p>
                    <p>We believe, subject to your views, that the visit should not be used to
                        negotiate a new <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program. However, we
                        will probably have to tell the Shah something in order to avoid risk of
                        disillusionment later; we also want US agencies speaking with one voice.</p>
                    <p>Hence it is important to decide at least tentatively beforehand on what size
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> package to use as the backdrop for
                        our approach. The <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Steering Group
                        recommended offering a $300 million five-year package as means of getting
                        Iran to cut its forces from 200,000 to a more efficient 150,000.
                            State/<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> have all agreed to up this to $330 million, <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0609"/>which they believe will be impressive, and
                        is maximum in light of our world-wide commitments (see <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>’s powerful case at Tab B).<note n="3" xml:id="d224fn3"><ref target="#d208">Document 208</ref>.</note> However,
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> argues that some $424
                        million is essential (Tab C);<note n="4" xml:id="d224fn4"><ref target="#d172">Document 172</ref>.</note> you will want to hear his
                        case.</p>
                    <p>Also relevant is that we may have to commit $400–$600 million over a like
                        period to Iran’s Third Development Plan. Indeed, we want to use the occasion
                        to educate the Shah on how undermining from within may be a greater threat
                        than external attack (cf. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s remarks to you at Vienna) and to convince him that
                        such economic aid is just as important as <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> in meeting Iran’s security needs.</p>

                            clearly cost him stature, but he remains the most formidable single

                            overt use of force against either Israel or his Arab opponents. (Paras.

                    </list>
                    <p>On March 28 the United Nations Security Council will commence consideration
                        of Syrian and Israeli complaints regarding military incidents <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0611"/>taking place around the northeastern area
                        of Lake Tiberias. Exchanges of fire going back to late February culminated
                        the night of March 16 in a retaliatory raid of Israeli forces numbering
                        perhaps 300 or 400. They assaulted Syrian positions from which the Israelis
                        alleged the Syrians had been firing upon their patrol boats and fishermen.
                        The raid was probably intended also to intimidate the Syrian government and
                        deter it from molestation of Israel’s territory.</p>
                    <p>From information available thus far, it seems likely the Syrians were guilty
                        of initiating fire against Israeli police boats from Syrian posts on the
                        hillsides overlooking the lake. It is also possible that the boats came
                        close to the Syrian shore. Also the Syrians have been very much concerned
                        recently with Israel’s plans to withdraw water from Lake Tiberias through
                        pumping installations now being constructed on the northwestern shore
                        although, as far as we can determine, these will not be ready to operate
                        until late 1963.</p>
                    <p>We believe the Israelis have not taken advantage of the <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> machinery to the extent that they might
                        have. While they are in contact with General <persName corresp="#p_VHMGCC1">Von Horn</persName> and his staff and agreed to the cease fire
                        suggested by <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> officers, they have
                        refused to return to the forum of the Israel-Syrian Mixed Armistice
                        Commission for settlement of border outbreaks.</p>
                    <p>The Security Council has on past occasions, with U.S. support, condemned
                        Israel’s use of retaliatory raids as a means of settling border
                        disturbances. However, there are differences between these recent incidents
                        and the events of the Gaza raid of 1954<note n="1" xml:id="d226fn1">Reference is presumably to Israel’s raid into Gaza and attack on
                            Egyptian military personnel of February 28, 1955; see <ref target="frus1955-57v14#pg_73"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                        of 1956<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">Reference is presumably to Israel’s
                            attack on Syrian positions in the Lake Tiberias area during the night of
                            December 11/12, 1955; see <ref target="frus1955-57v14#pg_854">ibid., pp.
                                854</ref>–<ref target="frus1955-57v14#pg_856">856</ref>.</note> for
                        both of which the Israelis were condemned by Security Council resolutions.
                        In both of the earlier incidents the Israeli raiders clearly crossed into
                        neighboring countries, and the reports of the Commander of the Truce
                        Supervision Organization established this. In the present instance it
                        appears the Israelis destroyed a Syrian military installation which was on
                        the border of the demilitarized zone and probably partly in Syrian
                        territory. The <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> Commander’s report
                        does not specify how far the Israelis penetrated. The Israelis are now
                        asserting they did not go beyond the boundary of the <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss>, and they may well attempt to differentiate their recent
                        actions from their earlier ones in 1954 and 1955 on this basis.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. has constantly opposed any Israeli use of retaliatory raids, and we
                        believe Israel must continue to understand it cannot continue to take the
                        law into its own hands. Israel will argue, no doubt, its subjection <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0612"/>to considerable provocation from
                        Syria, but for the U.S. to adopt any posture other than strong opposition to
                        these Israeli tactics might well be taken by the Israelis to indicate we
                        were prepared to tolerate similar future incidents and would, in addition,
                        create strong feelings in the Arab world against the U.S. for its
                        abandonment of a well established principle important to maintenance of
                        order in the area.</p>
                    <p>During the first session of the Security Council, on March 28, we plan to
                        speak briefly. The U.S. Representative would make two major points. First,
                        he would suggest the <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> Chief of Staff
                        be recalled to New York for consultation and recommend the Security Council
                        recess for about five days until he returns. This would buy time until the
                        implications of the latest Syrian coup are known, permit tempers to cool,
                        and establish the facts of the case more clearly. Secondly, we would try to
                        pre-empt the inevitable Soviet efforts to curry favor with the Arabs by
                        making a brief general statement which would indicate that we condone
                        neither the Syrian provocations nor the Israeli retaliation, putting heavier
                        stress on the latter than the former.</p>
                    <p>Our ultimate objective in the Security Council will be to get the Council to
                        express itself strongly in favor of maintenance of the cease fire, to uphold
                        the general armistice agreement, and to support and strengthen the United
                        Nations peacekeeping machinery in the area.</p>
                    <p>Israel prefers no resolution whatsoever. We consider, however, that this is
                        unrealistic. Since an extreme resolution is likely to be introduced by the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, we have informed our Mission to the United Nations that in
                        order to exercise some control over the outcome, they should embark on
                        consultations with friendly Council members with a view to developing a
                        reasonably balanced resolution which would contribute the maximum to
                        stabilizing the situation in the Near East while doing the minimum damage to
                        our relations with the Israelis and the Arabs. We would plan after
                        consultation with other friendly members of the Council to support, and
                        possibly co-sponsor, a resolution which would contain the following
                        elements: expression of our concern over developments in the area and note
                        of the fact that a cease fire is now in effect; in its operative sections
                        the resolution would remind the government of Israel that the Council has
                        already condemned military action “whether or not undertaken by way of
                        retaliation.” Our resolution would then condemn the Israeli attack of March
                        16 and 17 as a “flagrant violation” of the cease-fire provision of the
                        Council’s resolution of July 15, 1948,<note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3">Security
                            Council Resolution 54 (1948). For text, see <hi rend="italic">Official

                        Charter. The resolution would also hold that hostile actions from Syrian
                        territory on certain <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0613"/>specified
                        dates were clear violations of the cease fire and of Articles 1 and 3 of the
                        Armistice. Finally, the resolution would endorse proposals made by General
                            <persName corresp="#p_VHMGCC1">Von Horn</persName> for strengthening his
                        hand in keeping the peace. The Chief of Staff would be instructed to report
                        on compliance with the resolution. A copy of our suggested draft resolution
                        is enclosed.<note n="4" xml:id="d226fn4">Attached but not printed. The White
                            House approved the draft resolution that was transmitted to the U.S.

                    <p>We considered whether operative paragraphs 2 should “deplore” or “condemn”
                        the Israeli attack of March 16 and 17. It is expected that the minimum
                        Syrian demand will be for a resolution which condemns the attack and that
                        they could obtain a Soviet veto for a resolution which did not do this. We
                        also assume that there will be public and congressional sentiment in the
                        United States against condemning the attack and that the Israelis will make
                        a strong effort to distinguish this incident from earlier ones on grounds of
                        clearly greater Syrian provocations. While initiating consultations on a
                        draft using the word “deplore” would be more acceptable to Jewish opinion in
                        the United States, it would be difficult because of the anticipated pressure
                        from such groups to change our position from “deplore” to “condemn” during
                        the negotiations. Therefore, we feel that we must in the last analysis
                        “condemn” the Israeli attack and have a strong resolution for the following
                        reasons: (1) Condemnation of retaliatory raids is a principle we have
                        hitherto firmly upheld. As noted above, relaxation of our view would be
                        deeply resented by the Arabs and regarded as a positive gain for Israel, and
                        the latter could take our change of position to mean we now tolerate
                        retaliatory raids. (2) If we can secure a resolution from the Council, we
                        can reasonably hope, judging from past experience, that it will have a
                        pacifying effect on the area. The Soviets will almost certainly veto a
                        resolution which does not condemn the Israeli attack and would then be able
                        to pose as the champion of the Arabs. (3) We wish to strengthen <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> by action of the Council. (4) The
                        resolution also must make clear our firm disapproval of Syrian action. (5)
                        While we do not propose to overlook Syria’s guilt, we recognize that in the
                        present unstable political situation in Syria, a shift in the U.S. position
                        away from condemnation of retaliatory raids might create a difficult
                        situation for our relations with the new Syrian government. (6) The mission
                        of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_JJE1">Joseph Johnson</persName> with regard to
                        the Palestine refugees is scheduled to commence within a week or two. We
                        would like to restore as much stability and calm in the area in preparing
                        for his efforts as we can.</p>
                    <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0614"/>
                    <p>The voting picture in the Council will be roughly as follows: An extreme
                        resolution is likely to be supported by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Ghana, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and Rumania.
                        At the other end of the spectrum, the French will probably support the
                        Israeli position to the maximum, including a preference for no resolution.
                        The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will find itself in a dilemma like our
                        own. The Latin Americans, China and Ireland will probably tend to follow our

                    <p rend="center">ISRAEL’S NUCLEAR REACTOR</p>
                    <p>The Department of State is grateful for the careful consideration given by
                        the Foreign Office to the dangers of a nuclear race among countries of the
                        Near East set out in the Embassy’s communication of February 14.<note n="1" xml:id="d227fn1">Not found.</note> The Department fully shares the
                        Foreign Office conviction that an adequate safeguards system for nuclear
                        reactor development in that area is essential.</p>

                        <item>We concur in the desirability of working for introduction of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection system into the
                            Near East countries and acceptance by Israel would seem to be the
                            logical starting point. However, two significant objections can be
                            foreseen: One is Israel’s clear opposition to submission to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls until these are generally
                            accepted by other nations, and the other is that, under <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> procedures, both parties to <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0615"/>any agreement would probably
                            have to agree to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> supervision. The
                            Israel bilateral is with France, and it seems doubtful France would
                            agree to inspection by the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> of
                            irradiated elements after their return to French soil. A further
                            problem, recognized by the Foreign Office, is that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection, even if accepted, would
                            not commence until the Dimona reactor goes critical, some two years
                            hence, and it is in the intervening period that Arab suspicions and the
                            probability of sharp Arab reactions are likely to be greatest. While we
                            wish ultimately to see all nuclear reactors under <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection, we doubt Israel’s present
                            objections can be overcome regardless of the amount of suasion used, and
                            thus question the value of the sort of immediate, intense effort
                            envisaged by the Foreign Office. However, in forthcoming renegotiation
                            of the United States-Israel atoms-for-peace bilateral,<note n="2" xml:id="d227fn2">Documentation on the negotiations is in Department
                                of State, Central File 611.84A45. The agreement for cooperation
                                concerning civil uses of atomic energy, signed at Washington by the
                                United States and Israel on July 12, 1955 (6 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> 2641), was renewed on June 22, 1962 (13 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> 1289). The renewal contained an
                                amendment relating to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                                inspection.</note> which covers the reactor at Nabi Rubin, we will
                            make a strong effort to obtain Israel’s agreement to transfer to the
                                <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> of the specific inspection
                            function now allowed to the United States. In any case, we would propose
                            to make clear that the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> system is
                            ultimately the one we believe should exercise safeguards functions with
                            regard to peaceful uses of atomic energy in the Near East area and that,
                            as the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> system evolves and gains
                            additional adherents, we would expect Israel to accept its
                            supervision.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>However, ad hoc inspection that will satisfy both ourselves and the
                            world at large as to Israel’s actions in the period before the Dimona
                            reactor is completed seems imperative. As to suitable interim, neutral
                            inspectors, we doubt Canada is well qualified since it is closely
                            identified with the West in the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.
                            We think the Swiss, the Swedes, or some other Scandinavian country would
                            be better suited to provide the desired “neutral” confirmation of
                            Israel’s peaceful intentions. We have already had some discussion with
                            the Swedes about this and hope to be able to work out something pursuant
                            to Prime Minister Ben-Gurion’s May 1961 assurances to President

                        <item>A further complication to the introduction of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls has been the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> attitude toward these. It has voted against the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> system at every step. With the object

                        <p>A precarious political situation as well as an unstable economic
                            situation, both operating under the prevailing uneasy calm which
                            presently pervades the Iranian scene, are far more of a threat to Iran
                            than any present military threat.</p>
                        <p>A military threat to Iran stems only from Soviet capabilities in the form
                            of formidable ground, sea and air forces deployed behind the contiguous
                            border with Iran. While a limited conflict could be instigated by the
                            Soviets through the medium of Iraq and Afghanistan, this threat is not
                            considered an immediate one and would only develop if direct and
                            extensive Soviet support would be provided to them. This is considered
                            to have little likeli<persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> of
                            materializing within the next few years.</p>
                        <p>The Iranian army could not contain or seriously delay a major Soviet
                            attack. While the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may view Iran as
                            an especially promising and vulnerable target, it believes that events
                            are moving toward an internal revolutionary explosion which will result
                            in the overthrow of the Shah’s regime by nationalist, anti-Western
                            forces who would sever Iranian ties with the West. Soviet propaganda has
                            endeavored to hasten these developments by seeking to discredit the Shah
                            and his government. While Iran is the most vulnerable target for a
                            Soviet attempt to undermine <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, we
                            believe that Soviet policy toward Iran and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> will continue along the same non-military lines
                            described above. Barring a domestic upheaval which offered the Soviets
                            new opportunities for subversion and expansion of their political
                            influence or a global war, we do not foresee any dramatic Soviet
                            military moves against Iran over the next four or five years.</p>
                        <p>Iraq and Afghanistan have received extensive military and economic
                            support from the Soviets and are almost solely dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for a wide range of equipment and
                            supply for their armed forces as well as instruction in the use of the
                            new equipment. Over a period of time the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> military aid and training is certain to have an
                            important influence on their internal as well as foreign policy. For the
                            present, however, it appears that Soviet aid has been delivered to these
                            countries <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0618"/>for political effect
                            and has not substantially increased the military capability of their
                            Armed Forces which are concerned primarily with internal security and
                            will be for the foreseeable future. They do not have the trained
                            manpower, facilities, maintenance, and supply ability to properly employ
                            the equipment over a sustained period. Thus while their military
                            capabilities are certain to increase gradually during the next few years
                            provided Soviet assistance continues, neither Iraq nor Afghanistan have
                            a present capability for offensive operations against Iran.</p>
                        <p>The military assistance effort already planned by the U.S. will enable
                            Iran to stay ahead of Iraq and Afghanistan in its military capabilities.
                            In spite of the steady efforts which the U.S. has made to modernize the
                            Iranian Army and increase its effectiveness, its capabilities continue
                            to be limited. Its main deficiencies are its excessive size, the low
                            level of general education and technical aptitude, inept leadership, a
                            cumbersome system of command, supply and administration, inadequate
                            transportation and communication facilities, and a lack of combat
                            experience. Despite the attention that has been lavished on the military
                            by the Shah whose rule rests primarily on their loyalty, the army has
                            not acquired great prestige in the eyes of the Iranian people both in
                            and out of government, and a growing number of the younger officers have
                            the discontent of the civilian middle class from which they come. In
                            order to reduce the possibility that the army could become a threat to
                            his position, the Shah has encouraged factionalism, competing
                            intelligence services and conflicting chains of command. To a
                            considerable degree, the military hierarchy is corrupt, wasteful and
                            inefficient. The capabilities of the Armed Forces are generally low,
                            although a slow, steady improvement has been made.</p>
                        <p>We believe that in spite of the foregoing U.S. assessment of the poor
                            capability of the Iranian Armed Forces, that Iran does have the
                            capability to defend against any purely Iraqi or Afghan aggression but
                            in the foreseeable future will not have any significant capability
                            against Soviet military action.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Background</hi>—See Enclosure.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi>—Two major considerations influence the
                            US strategic concept for the defense of the Middle East: First, the
                            unusually formidable terrain obstacles to Soviet over-land incursion to
                            the area and, second, the unquestionable Soviet recognition of the
                            United States and Free World vital interests in the area.</p>
                        <p>Consideration of the above factors, together with Soviet military
                            inaction in the area over the past several years impels the United
                            States to the view that Soviet military attack of the Middle East area
                            is, first, unlikely in the near future, and, secondly, would under any
                            circumstances occur in conjunction with aggression in other world
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>The United States places reliance upon the Armed Forces of Iran and its
                            other <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> Allies to execute
                            effective ground delaying action in areas adjacent to the Soviet
                            borders.</p>
                        <p>Certain measures of limited nonnuclear response to Soviet attack on Iran
                            can be taken by US forces to counter limited Soviet intervention and
                            probing aggression. Inadequacies of road and rail facilities in Iran
                            limit commitment of US conventional forces to two Army Divisions and
                            Marine and US Air Force Combat elements to Northern Iran. By extensive
                            use of US Air Transport capabilities, about two additional battle groups
                            could be supported.</p>
                        <p>Commitment of US forces in sufficient time to counter a Soviet advance
                            into Iran requires use of the only two airborne divisions presently in
                            the US Strategic Reserve and all of the airlift capability including the
                            Civil Reserve Air Fleet, resulting in a serious dilution of the
                            capability to respond to other contingencies.</p>
                        <p>The ability to commit conventional forces as indicated above is based
                            upon the assumption that authorization by the President for the use of
                            nuclear weapons will be given as required to achieve US objectives in
                            the area, should the Soviets persist in spite of US actions.</p>
                        <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0620"/>
                        <p>Should this conventional response on the part of the United States, Iran,
                            and their Allies prove to be insufficient to turn back a Soviet
                            invasion, the United States and her <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> Allies are capable of a limited nuclear action
                            consisting primarily of interdiction of Soviet routes of advance through
                            the difficult terrain in the border areas and nuclear attack of Soviet
                            airfields which are directly supporting their operations. <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> plans for such action exist.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the United States has the option of fully escalating the defense
                            to general nuclear war.</p>

                                plans assume that general war plans would be invoked. The forces
                                earmarked for contingency operations short of general war consist of
                                two battle groups, five fighter squadrons, 1/3 Marine Division/wing

                                Iran, the movement by air over these planned routes is no longer

                            the support which Iran obtains from the over-all US defense posture:</p>
                        <p>US policy with regard to the Middle East is to hold as far forward as
                            possible of the Northernmost boundary of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> countries. This includes Iran, which has a common
                            frontier with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The only US forces in the vicinity of Iran are 2 Destroyers and 1 <gloss target="#t_AVP1">AVP</gloss>, under the control of <gloss target="#t_CINCNELM1">CINCNELM</gloss> and operating in the Persian
                            Gulf, the Red and Arabian Seas.</p>
                        <p>Two US Tactical Fighter Sqs in Turkey are earmarked for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> use; however, it is conceivable that
                            they could be employed in Iran as directed by the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff.</p>
                        <p>The US 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, although committed to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, could be considered as a potential
                            force for use in reinforcing Iran, particularly the air-transportable
                            elements of the Marine <gloss target="#t_BLT1">BLT</gloss> normally
                            embarked.</p>
                        <p>The US 7th Fleet in the Pacific, although committed to the <gloss target="#t_PACOM1">PACOM</gloss> area, could also be considered a
                            potential for use in support of contingencies in Iran.</p>
                        <p>The nearest Army forces which could be sent to reinforce Iranian forces
                            are 2 Airborne <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> Groups in

                        <p>The over-all US defense posture has increased to a considerable degree
                            during the past year as a result of Presidential determination to
                            increase <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0622"/>the US conventional
                            capability. With activation of USSTRICOM, a US unified command has been
                            established which will contribute a great deal to US world-wide strength
                            in increasing capability to react rapidly to cope with
                            communist-inspired emergencies. Recent exercises in which US troops were

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi></p>
                    <p>On March 27–28 the Army in Syria ousted the President, the Prime Minister and
                        the Cabinet, dissolved the Parliament, and is presently governing the
                        country with the assistance of senior civil servants who are operating the
                        various Ministries as Acting Ministers. Reports from our Embassy in Damascus
                        indicate that the main motivation for the Army takeover was dissatisfaction
                        with various policies and actions of the civilian authorities, that it may
                        reflect increased pressure for a socialist policy within the Army, and may
                        partially have been inspired by fear that the Government of President Qudsi
                        had gone too far in seeking rapprochement with Iraq. Whereas some of the
                        Army’s earlier communiqués suggest that an attempt would be made to
                        conciliate the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>, it seems clear that
                        the ring leaders of the present Army movement are, with minor exceptions,
                        the same officers who carried out the September 28 revolution. It has been
                        emphasized by the regime and by the Acting Foreign Minister in a
                        conversation with our Ambassador that this government is a “continuation of
                        the 28th of September revolution and … a purely internal measure to correct
                        certain internal conditions… .”</p>
                    <p>You may recall that at the time we recognized the Syrian Arab Republic on
                        October 10, 1961, the situation was as follows: The Supreme Arab
                        Revolutionary Command, i.e. roughly the same group of officers conducting
                        the present movement, had installed a civilian provisional government headed
                        by Prime Minister and Acting Chief of State Mahmun Kuzbari, which governed
                        pending the holding of elections for a Constituent Assembly.</p>
                    <p>The Assembly was later duly elected, under terms of an electoral law which
                        had existed prior to Syrian union with Egypt, and the Assembly <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0625"/>in turn elected <persName corresp="#p_alQN1">Nazim al-Qudsi</persName> as President, and the Army
                        declared it had “returned to its barracks” and was turning the reins of
                        government over to civilian authorities. However, at the time of the Army
                        takeover on March 27–28, the Assembly had not drafted or promulgated a
                        permanent constitution.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that the Army authorities issued an official statement on
                        March 28 which, inter alia, asserted that “the Command will adopt the policy
                        of positive neutrality and non-alignment, will safeguard international
                        charters, will respect (its) agreements and will adhere to the principles of
                        the United Nations.” Further, our Ambassador was summoned by the
                        Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces on March 28 and was assured that the
                        Army takeover was an internal matter and that there would be no change in
                        Syrian foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>While the reassumption by the Army of power on March 27–28 is claimed by the
                        Army regime to be a continuation of the 28th of September revolution, there
                        has in fact been a major change in the character of the government which
                        presents a question as to the recognition of the new regime. However, on the
                        assumption that we desire to recognize and to continue relations with the
                        new regime, this can be done without expressly raising the question of
                        recognition. Recognition of a new government need not be expressly stated
                        but may be implied from continuance of normal contacts and relations with
                        the new regime.</p>
                    <p>We believe it would be desirable that we have authority to authorize
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName> to inform the
                        Acting Syrian Foreign Minister early in the week of April 1 that we intend
                        to continue business as usual, and that we wish the Syrian Government and
                        people every success. Prior to taking this action we would hope to
                        coordinate with the United Kingdom with a view to its taking a parallel
                        course.</p>
                    <p>We might also authorize Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName> at that time to assure the new government that we
                        intend to carry on with present economic assistance programs and
                        specifically with a loan agreement signed on March 27 designed to support
                        the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>-approved Syrian stabilization
                        program.</p>
                    <p>We believe prompt action along these lines will provide a favorable basis for
                        initiating our relations with the new government and accordingly request
                        your approval.</p>

                    <p>That you authorize us to inform Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName> early next week to inform the Syrian authorities (a)
                        that we intend to continue doing business as usual, (b) that we intend to

                        <p rend="center">REPORT ON MISSION TO THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC</p>
                        <p>My visit, following on the heels of visits by Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName>, has probably created certain expectations in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The most immediately pressing economic problem is a balance of payments
                            difficulty arising principally from a serious crop failure last <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0629"/>year. Shortage of foreign
                            exchange has already forced a slowing down of development expenditures.
                            If negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a stabilization
                            arrangement are successful, certain drawing rights on the Fund will
                            become available, but these will not be large enough to relieve the
                            difficulty without a further sharp cutback in the development program.
                            It will certainly be expected that the U.S., presumably with others,
                            will participate in any stabilization arrangement that is negotiated. I
                            did not raise this question but the question was raised with me and I
                            limited myself to the remark that no doubt the U.S. would want to be
                            assured that arrangements satisfactory to the I.M.F. were negotiated and
                            that other countries with important trade relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would be willing to participate.</p>
                        <p>Information necessary to an assessment of development progress was made
                            available and the cooperation of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            officials was quite satisfactory. During the fiscal year 1960–61 the
                            real national income of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            increased by 5.8 percent. The current year, as a result of the crop
                            failure, will probably show only a slight increase. There seems
                            sufficient reason to believe, barring further crop failures, and
                            assuming foreign loans and grants at about the current rate, that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> can support a growth rate of
                            four to six percent per annum, which, though short of the planned rate,
                            is substantial. The large-scale nationalization and sequestration of
                            last summer and fall have brought management difficulties, but they are
                            not sufficiently serious, in my judgment, to modify this estimate. There
                            is no real doubt in my mind that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            is seriously concerned with economic development and that the prospects
                            of sustaining a satisfactory rate of growth are favorable.</p>
                        <p>The implications for U.S. economic policy are, in my view, as follows: <list>

                                    foreign exchange to meet its reasonable development
                                    requirements. Effective planning to meet these requirements
                                    would be greatly facilitated by a multi-year program on which, I
                                    understand, there have been initial discussions.</item>

                    <p>It was agreed that an effort would be made to arrange a joint session of
                        Congress to hear the Shah, even if Congressional attendance proved sparse.
                        The Shah seemed insistent, particularly since Ayub had appeared before
                        Congress, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> would call
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>. The President
                        would tell the Shah to discuss <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> with
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> should give the Shah the highlights of our proposed
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> package. This was better than the
                        President having to argue the case. It was agreed that the President would
                        talk in general terms about our desire to modernize the Iranian forces.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that
                        we can accelerate <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> deliveries; this, plus
                        the $330 million package should increase the apparent flow by 50–100% which
                        would look very good to the Iranians.</p>
                    <p>The President desired a memo on things we were doing or planned to do for
                        Iran that had not been done before, particularly <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> items.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that the
                        President tell the Shah we would send a small military planning mission (to
                        be part of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>) to assist the Iranians
                        in planning more effectively for their own defense. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that he could avoid
                        describing one or two key <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> items during
                        his discussion with the Shah, e.g., the C–130s; then the President could
                        tell the Shah about these at the second meeting as an additional
                        concession.</p>
                    <p>The President desired that we take a look at the sufficiencies of our
                        commitments to Iran to come to its defense in event of attack. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> hoped that we could go so far
                        as to say we would send in one or two divisions in event of limited attack.
                        It was agreed that this should be explored.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> reported that King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> had summoned him to
                            express his concern over reports of serious disturbances in the cities
                            of Aleppo, Homs, and Hama in Syria, reportedly connected with efforts to
                            restore <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s authority over
                            Syria. <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> also pointed to
                            reports of Israeli and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> troop
                            movements. (Ibid., 783.00/4–162)</note> Prime Minister called me to his
                        office 0900 April 2. Said situation in Syria had become far more serious
                        than at time my conversation with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> yesterday afternoon (reference telegram), and that
                        he now convinced that issue was whether or not <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> power to be restored there.</p>
                    <p>I asked what new information he had which would support this conclusion.
                        Prime Minister said that trouble in Syria had now spread as far south as
                        Dera where he just received information <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        flag now flying. He cited other alleged reports. These did not seem
                        convincing to me and when I pointed out he said real basis for his
                        conclusion was “Arab intuition”. He then repeated thesis that King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> had previously argued with me many
                        times, i.e. that if Nasserism regains control of Syria, moderate progressive
                        capitalistic governments such as in Jordan, doomed in this part of Arab
                        world. He said that in view of this Jordan would prefer face showdown in
                        Syria rather than face issue later on when defeat inevitable.</p>
                    <p>When I questioned thesis that Jordan demise inevitable if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regained control of Syria, Prime
                        Minister held to his position but added that even if this not the case
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reappearance in Syria
                        would mean re-establishment of iron-fist totalitarian control not only in
                        Syria area but in Jordanian area as well. Re latter said if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> regained control of Syria, Jordan would
                        have to take extreme internal security measures which in effect would mean
                        establishment of rigid conservative military dictatorship here which would
                        be completely incompatible with progressive objectives he and his government
                        now pursuing in Jordan.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister next said that while <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> threat in Syria very great, he believed that
                            anti-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> forces could still prevail
                        provided prompt action taken and he made it clear that if necessary
                        Jordanians prepared send troops to Syria to bolster anti-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> forces.</p>
                    <p>I repeated all arguments cited reference telegram. I then made added strong
                        argument against Jordan taking precipitous action based <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0632"/>on Arab “intuition” and noted that in fact
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> had no more information this morning
                        than it had yesterday and actual situation in Syria remained very unclear.
                        Said that any Jordanian troop movement even within its own borders could
                        greatly strengthen propaganda hand of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and undercut <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                        objectives in Syria.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister said that if Jordan Arab Army (<gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss>) troops moved they would not stop at border but would keep
                        going until they reached Damascus. At same time, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would make clear that purpose of troop movement to Syria
                        would be to restore recently deposed civilian government and would withdraw
                        immediately following a plebiscite which would give Syrians opportunity free
                        choice type of government and alignment they desired. If Syrian people
                        freely chose associate with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>,<gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would regret this
                        but would not oppose it. On other hand, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                        could not tolerate Syrians being brought back forcefully and against the
                        majority will into <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out discrepancy between numbers of Jordanian and Syrian troops and
                        suggested Jordan troops would be swallowed up before they could carry out
                        this objective. Prime Minister disagreed saying that if <gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss> moved quickly and decisively they would be
                        supported by elements Syrian army dedicated to same objectives.</p>
                    <p>I noted that if Jordan troops entered Syria, Iraqi troops might also come in.
                        Prime Minister said that would not create problem as <gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss> would not fight Iraqis and both could withdraw after
                        plebiscite and restoration of civilian government. I said I thought this
                        great over simplification of problem and that if Jordan troops went across
                        border they would be stepping into morass from which it would be most
                        difficult extricate themselves.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion, Prime Minister stressed that he had not yet reached
                        firm conclusion that it would be necessary send Jordanian troops to Syria
                        and that he not yet prepared to make such a recommendation until situation
                        further clarified. Said, however, that if <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> decided to move would move very quickly and Jordanian
                        troops might be in Damascus by tomorrow morning. I said I thought this not
                        only unwise but impossible.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister then made two specific requests. First, he asked that USG make
                        immediate démarche to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> urging
                        that he stay out of Syrian situation. Second, he requested that USG, through
                        its Embassy in Damascus, seek put backbone in military junta by assuring it
                        of USG support against “minority” forces seeking restore <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> control over Syria. At same time,
                        suggested USG apply pressure on junta to make its peace with previous
                        civilian government so they could work together against pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> elements. (After leaving Prime Minister’s
                        office, and while dictating this telegram, Prime Minister telephoned me
                        adding <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0633"/>further request that US
                        Embassy in Damascus pass word to Zahr ad-Din that <gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss> stood ready to be of assistance if he should so
                        request.)</p>
                    <p>Conversation concluded with my reiterating strong advice that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> remain calm and not take foolish or
                        precipitous action. I emphasized again that neither <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>, nor anyone else at moment, had any firm information re
                        higher nature, or degree of seriousness, current Syrian situation. Prime
                        Minister replied he still not ready recommend any major action unless
                        further developments within Syria made this absolutely essential and said he
                        would keep in touch with me.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> While I believe <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is more concerned re Syrian situation this morning than
                        yesterday, I conclude that much of Prime Minister’s talk was designed to
                        emphasize to USG gravity <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> attaches to
                        situation. Absence of <gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss> troop movement and
                        low-key nature of military alert remains as reported <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>. I am, nevertheless, concerned that
                        combination of Jordan fear of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and
                        prevalence of unsubstantiated but alarming rumors, could lead to precipitous
                        action on part of <gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss> particularly if <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> authorities conclude that moment had been
                        reached when they must act or <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> triumph in
                        Syria will be assured.</p>
                    <p>Embassy is keeping in close touch with situation and will continue to counsel
                        restraint. I will be seeing King later in day.</p>
                    <p>With regard Prime Minister’s first two requests, I defer to Department and my
                        colleagues in Damascus and Cairo as to whether representations along these
                        lines would serve any useful purpose. With regard to his third (telephone)
                        request, assume Department will not wish USG channels be used for this type
                        communication. However, believe <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> will
                        seek use other channels including its own to get this message through to
                        Zahr ad-Din.</p>

                            in telegram 641 from Damascus, April 3, that Ustuwani, using the title

                            warn that “any military intervention whatsoever in Syria would
                            constitute interference in Syria internal affairs and would be regarded

                    <p>It was agreed that consultations with Dr. Johnson and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> over the past two months have served a
                        useful purpose in refining possible approaches to the problem of winning

                        directions, of a limited number of refugees in a limited period. This
                        appears the only practical way to break down the psychological and political

                    <p>Dr. Johnson indicated his intention not to present a “present proposal”
                        during his coming visit to the Near East. His ideas are crystallized to date
                        only in regard to initial discussion with the Israelis. Dr. Johnson said his
                        approach would include the following elements: (a) a statement that, as a
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> official, he cannot force compliance
                        with General Assembly resolutions which are in the nature of
                        recommendations, and that he must try to define possibilities for agreement
                        within the framework of the sovereign concerns of Israel and the Arab
                        states; (b) the statement that what is under discussion is initial movement
                        of a small number of refugees rather than an over-all solution; (c)
                        questioning the Israelis as to the circumstances under which they would be
                        willing to accept some repatriation and as to Israel’s own views of what
                        repatriation and compensation would mean in practice; (d) forewarning <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0638"/>that he is quite prepared to leave
                        Israel and return directly to the United States if discussions in Israel
                        prove wholly fruitless but that, alternatively, he would plan to return to
                        Israel on this same round, after talking to the Arabs, if there is prospect
                        of progress; (e) the statement that no plan would be set down in detail
                        until his return to the U.S. had provided an opportunity to consult with his
                        principals in the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWRJ1">Crawford</persName> commented on the
                        reasonableness of this approach. If negotiations break down, Dr. Johnson
                        will clearly wish at least to avoid a situation in which the Arabs unite in
                        opposition to his proposals. Provided that is avoided and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> were willing to stand on the sidelines, Dr.
                        Johnson might consider whether there is hope of doing anything on a one or
                        two country basis.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson agreed this is one “fall back” position to be considered.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he had been advised on the previous day by Lebanon’s

                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HG7">Hakim</persName>, that the current

                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he will wish to meet chiefs and/or heads of state on this

                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he will inform Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> from Jerusalem, through American Consulate General
                        channels, of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> response, if any. If no

                    <p>Dr. Johnson said that, as during his first round, he will be under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> auspices and does not want close
                        identification with American officials. He does not wish to be met on
                        arrival and will take the initiative in getting in touch with Chiefs of
                        Mission, with whom he is most anxious to consult.</p>
                    <p>Department officers assured Dr. Johnson that Missions would be instructed to
                        provide full facilities consistent with this Government’s continuing support
                        of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> initiative. Thought has been
                        given to the desirability of high level approaches to the Arabs and Israelis
                        prior to Dr. Johnsons’s departure. It is concluded that this is perhaps
                        necessary only with the Israelis. In recent weeks they have tended to
                        deprecate the Johnson mission as an exercise “for-the-record”, presumably
                        with the <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0639"/>objective of watering down
                        Prime Minister Ben-Gurion’s May 1961 commitment to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson said he thinks a high level USG approach to the Israelis should
                        be made.</p>

                    <p>It was agreed <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> Chairman <persName corresp="#p_ES2">Eldem</persName> (Turkey) should inform Iraqi and Saudi
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representatives that, consistent with
                        his terms of reference, Dr. Johnson has not scheduled visits to Baghdad and
                        Saudi Arabia, but would be happy to meet with representatives of these
                        countries at their initiative at any time. It was noted that the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss>’s March 27 letter to Dr. Johnson
                            (attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d237fn2">Attached but not printed.</note>
                        authorizes contacts with non-government groups and individuals, such as
                        refugee leaders, “in the nature of information-gathering as distinct from
                        official consultations”. It was recognized that a relationship with refugee
                        leaders may be useful, but that the Department does not wish the actions of
                        the Special Representative to encourage the “Palestine entity” concept.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Johnson was informed of certain detailed Department comments on Working
                        Paper V, inter alia the Department’s conclusion that it would not be wise to
                        use the open mails in Near East countries for distribution of refugee
                        questionnaires.</p>

                            Compensation:</hi></p>
                    <p>Department officers noted that Dr. Johnson has not requested a commitment in
                        specific terms regarding U.S. willingness to contribute financially to
                        progress on the refugee problem. The Department’s position, therefore,
                        remains as stated to Dr. Johnson in New York on March 14.<note n="3" xml:id="d237fn3">See <ref target="#d213">Document 213</ref>.</note> (“As
                        a matter of history, the United States has expressed willingness to give
                        generous support to programs that offer prospect of real progress on aspects
                        of the Arab-Israel problem. The willingness to seek legislative authority
                        for such support continues today.”) Department officers reiterated the hope
                        that detailed financial discussions can be avoided during the “second
                        round”.</p>
                    <p>Department officers agreed with Dr. Johnson’s general observation that the
                        cost of a 10–15 year program for a definitive solution of the refugee
                        problem could be estimated as between $1–$2 billion.</p>
                    <p>Department officers reserved position on the application of compensation as
                        set forth in Working Paper V. As Dr. Johnson is aware, the <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0640"/>Department’s traditional position has been
                        that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> responsibility for ensuring
                        compensation applies only “on one side of the line”, i.e. to those who do
                        not opt for repatriation. This does not mean, of course, that there may not
                        be the possibility of redress through the Israel courts. Further, and while
                        the Department recognizes room for differences of interpretation on this
                        point, we have always tended to regard compensation as including only
                        payment for immovable property adjusted to reflect the depreciation in money
                        values since 1948. At the same time, the Department is not opposed in
                        principle to some form of per capita payment, outside the context of
                        compensation, to enable needy refugees moving in either direction to get a
                        new start in life.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson acknowledged that there is a difference between the Department’s
                        thinking and his own regarding the nature of the compensation obligation.
                        Shorn of its “legislative history”, paragraph 11 of Resolution 194 would not
                        seem to exclude an obligation to compensate those who choose repatriation.
                        Nor does the wording of the resolution necessarily bear out the Department’s
                        view of a very narrow definition of what is included under compensation.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that Dr. Johnson’s coming conversations in the area would
                        develop a greater insight into the position of all parties on the financial
                        and compensation aspects of the problem.</p>

                        preoccupation with military assistance matters has overshadowed two basic
                        premises for U.S. strategy toward Iran.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First: Iran is going through a critical period of socio-political
                            upheaval. Rapid and conspicuous progress in the economic development <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0641"/>program and various reforms is
                            essential to maintain reasonable political cohesion.</item>
                        <item>Second: While recognizing the symbolic and stabilizing role of the
                            monarchy—we are looking to the present regime of Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> rather more than to the
                            Shah—to provide the impetus toward faster economic progress, reform, and
                            the beginnings of a political synthesis which will speed the process of
                            modernization.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The briefing papers imply that you should be completely silent on the role of
                        the Prime Minister. I fear that this could be misconstrued and result in
                        failure to convey to the Shah the view that the U.S. looks on <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s efforts as contributing to both
                        U.S. interests and the Shah’s. After all, it was only several months ago
                        that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> successfully
                        headed off an attempt by the Shah to dump <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>.</p>
                    <p>While the briefing papers are right in pointing out the Shah’s jealousy of
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>, in my opinion, careful but
                        pointed reference to your recognition of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s efforts and the importance of continued support by
                        the Shah would be useful and less risky than a studied avoidance of any
                        discussion. There will continue to be a difficult relationship between the
                        two men under the pressure of recurrent crises in Iran. But we should not
                        overlook the importance of <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> as
                        perhaps the only Iranian politician with the intelligence, prominence, and
                        courage to pursue a reformist policy with some prospects of success.</p>
                    <p>Possibly more important is the need to convey firmly to the Shah that we
                        consider economic and social progress, particularly at this stage in Iran’s
                        development, to be of overriding importance—and that the U.S. stands ready
                        to assist substantially in this effort.</p>
                    <p>The briefing papers concentrate on the necessity for “unselling” the Shah
                        from a bigger and more glamorous military package. I believe there should be
                        far greater stress on “selling” the Shah on the need for moving faster on
                        the economic and reform front.</p>
                    <p>This need not involve any more aid commitments than are already proposed. It
                        can readily take the form of simply revealing to the Shah your own
                        assessment of the relative priority of this effort in the nation-building
                        process—that you view the 3rd Plan and the reform programs as the “right”
                        things to do—and that failure or inadequate progress constitute the major
                        risk to Iran, his regime, and U.S. interests.</p>
                    <p>On both of these points the briefing papers appear to convey a fear that
                        either the Shah might be driven by jealousy to jettison <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> or that he might be spurred to
                        renewed interference with <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s
                        economic and social reform and development activities.</p>
                    <p>These fears, given the irrational nature of the Shah, are not entirely
                        groundless. But I believe it is extremely important that the Shah depart
                        with an understanding that, while we do not underrate his importance, <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0642"/>or the legitimacy of some of his
                        concerns regarding the military posture and prospects of Iran, our economic
                        and military support is predicated upon the firm view that we look to the
                        development of a responsible ministerial government capable of achieving
                        economic progress and political stability as a cornerstone of our efforts
                        and his own future.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, after pointing
                        out that the Shah was apparently going to focus his pleas on Iran’s need for
                        modern airpower, described a way in which we could meet these needs without
                        going over the $330 million ceiling. He proposed, subject to further
                        checking, that we rejuggle the package to give Iran four squadrons of N–156
                        fighters, some sort of improved airfield in eastern Iran, and possibly also
                        some early warning radar. To permit this we would drop out two frigates and
                        two minesweepers for a saving of $10 million. The Secretary also believed
                        that we could save $28 million by recalculating the maintenance costs within
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for Iran since these seemed
                        excessive. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> agreed
                        that this would be a much better package. The President approved going ahead
                        on this basis.</p>
                    <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0643"/>
                    <p>It was clearly understood that a five year package along the above lines
                        would be contingent upon a force cut to 150,000 men. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> believed that the Shah would accept
                        such a reduction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> stressed the importance of
                        not talking solely about military matters with the Shah, but of impressing
                        upon him the key role of economic development and telling him that if the
                        3rd Plan looked good we would make a substantial contribution. The President
                        agreed that he would not neglect the economic side in his discussions with
                        the Shah.</p>
                    <p>The President was told about the proposal to offer to finance the
                            <persName>Bandar Abbas</persName> port project,<note n="2" xml:id="d239fn2">In an April 5 memorandum to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> strongly recommended that, in discussions with

                            attached to the <persName>Bandar Abbas</persName> port project, which
                            could be used by Afghanistan to obtain an outlet to the sea through
                            Iranian territory and thus provide Afghanistan with an alternative to

                        our interest in the 3rd Plan. Either he or Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> will mention this to the Shah.</p>
                    <p>The President again asked about our commitments to come to the support of
                        Iran. There was discussion of the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> 1958 letter. No conclusion was reached as to
                        whether we should go any further in statements indicating commitments to
                        come to Iran’s assistance, since Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> did not believe that this issue was likely to be
                        posed in such a manner.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi></p>
                    <p>Dr. Johnson plans to arrive in Tel Aviv on April 14. Rather than seeking
                        agreement on a specific “package”, he intends to take soundings on a variety
                        of possible approaches to a limited initial movement of refugees in a
                        limited period, in the hope that such a pilot project would break down
                        long-standing psychological and political barriers.</p>
                    <p>Arab leaders appear to understand the full U.S. backing of the Johnson-<gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> initiative. They are being
                        (uncharacteristically) cautious in avoiding propaganda or other moves that
                        would jeopardize the initiative and place on them the onus of recalcitrance.
                        Israel, on the other hand, assures us of its cooperation (although
                        deprecating Dr. Johnson’s chances of success) while quietly stimulating
                        action designed to thwart the effort. It has encouraged Congressional
                        support of direct Arab-Israel peace negotiations, which would cut across the
                        lines of the Johnson mission and show the U.S. in Arab eyes as the partisan
                        supporter of an Israel propaganda line. Israel representatives seek our
                        acknowledgement that this effort is “for-the-record” only, presumably to
                        water down the reluctant commitment to cooperate in a try at this sort of
                        approach which Ben-Gurion made to the President last May.</p>
                    <p>Both we and Dr. Johnson think the Israelis need to be reminded in general but
                        firm terms of Ben-Gurion’s commitment to the President and of our full
                        support of the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> initiative. To give the
                        requisite emphasis to our views, we suggest you call in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> (30 minutes would be adequate). A
                        parallel approach by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> to Prime Minister Ben-Gurion and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> is planned, as well as a talk with
                        selected American Jewish leaders to solicit support.</p>

                    <p>Two conversations which I had this morning lead me to pass on the following
                        information and suggestions: <list>

                            <item>The President called <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Harlan
                                    Cleveland</persName> last night and wanted to know why things
                                had developed the way they had on the Lake Tiberias <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0647"/>incident without his knowing the
                                details and being kept informed. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Harlan</persName>, I assume, made the logical defense, that the
                                Secretary’s memorandum on the original resolution calling for
                                condemnation had gone over to the President<note n="1" xml:id="d242fn1"><ref target="#d226">Document 226</ref>.</note>
                                and this had been followed up by further contacts between State and
                                the White House, exclusive of Mr. Stevenson’s relations with the
                                White House. The President reputedly told <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Harlan</persName> that <persName>Mike Feldman</persName> was
                                the man who handled problems of the sort with which the Council had
                                just been confronted. The President was obviously very much annoyed
                                by the amount of pressure which he was getting on this particular
                                problem.</item>

                            <item><p>The Israeli correspondent, Yaari, who obviously is more than a
                                    correspondent since his brother was in the Embassy here in
                                    Washington and is now in the Foreign Ministry, called on me to
                                    get an explanation as to why the resolution adopted in the
                                    Security Council last week was so “one-sided”. He gave me the
                                    expected <persName>Ben</persName>-<persName>Gurion</persName>
                                    and soon-to-be Zionist line on our unfairness; he particularly
                                    attacked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName>
                                    for having been critical of Syrian provocations in his first
                                    speech and his not seeing to it that there was similar criticism
                                    in the resolution which was adopted.</p>
                                <p>I defended our resolution as eminently just and as balanced as we
                                    could get it under the circumstances given Israel’s previous
                                    offenses of a similar nature. I pointed out that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> had heavily
                                    stressed Syrian provocations but our position on this subject
                                    was well-known. I also emphasized that our concern was to get a
                                    positive resolution which would strengthen the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in the area and that in order to
                                    do this, we had to give careful consideration to the tactical
                                    situation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This
                                    tactical situation not only included Soviet veto, but our own
                                    careful estimate of a substantial fallout of votes on our
                                    resolution if we were unable to take the wind out of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> (Syrian) resolution which had
                                    been tabled previously.</p>
                                <p>We went through the rest of the well-known differences which we
                                    have including Israel’s non-participation in the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>, its sovereignty over the
                                    Demilitarized Zone and sovereignty over Lake Tiberias--all of
                                    which were raised at Yaari’s initiative.</p></item>

                            <item>In view of the two paragraphs above, it is perhaps well for you to
                                have full recollection of the following developments in this case: <list>

                                    <item><p>Our first draft resolution which we proposed to send to
                                            the White House with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>’s memorandum included the positive
                                            elements of cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but had as operative paragraphs the
                                            condemnation of Israel’s retaliatory action of March 16,
                                            17 and a subsequent paragraph which held that Syria’s
                                            actions on March 8 were a clear <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0648"/>violation of the
                                            Armistice Agreement and the provisions of Article 2 (4)
                                            of the <persName>Charter</persName>. You will recall
                                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> was
                                            unhappy originally at the idea of condemnation but
                                            bought our position on the basis of my suggestion that
                                            Israel having [had] been condemned twice already for
                                            similar military action. Were we to start with language
                                            less than that, it would be misunderstood in the Arab
                                            world to our detriment and, far worse, we could not,
                                            given the problems of domestic politics, “escalate
                                            upward” the language of the resolution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> was persuaded and
                                            the original resolution went over as indicated.</p>
                                        <p>You will also recall that the following day Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> asked the same
                                            question and we gave him the same answer and he was
                                            satisfied with our decision on condemnation.</p></item>

                                    <item>The first time that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> apparently paid any attention to
                                        the resolution was Tuesday night, April 3, at which time he
                                        rejected the condemnation paragraph and decided to speak to
                                        the President the following noon at luncheon (luncheon for
                                        President Goulart, Brazil) on the subject. He came to
                                        Washington and at a meeting following the luncheon (at which
                                        I was present), he indicated that the President had rather
                                        quickly brushed him off by suggesting that the entire
                                        problem was between him and the Department. As a result of
                                        our meeting that afternoon, it was <persName>Bob
                                            Strong</persName>’s and my impression that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> had agreed that
                                        our position was correct, namely: that condemnation was
                                        necessary and that there had to be a subsequent paragraph
                                        commenting on Syria’s action as a violation of the Armistice
                                        Agreement, etc. Subsequent to that time, you, <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Harlan Cleveland</persName> and Mr.
                                            <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> met
                                        with the Secretary. You are acquainted with the
                                        circumstances of that meeting. The result of that meeting
                                        was the preparation of the memorandum which went forward
                                        jointly initialed by you and <persName>Harlan</persName> the
                                        following day setting forth alternative positions with
                                        regard to the critical paragraph on Israel’s action but
                                        forcefully urging that the stronger position be
                                        taken.</item>

                                    <item>I am informed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName>, following that meeting with you
                                        and the Secretary, notified Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAMJ1">Schlesinger</persName> and, I gather, Mr.
                                            <persName>Bundy</persName> that he favored a weaker
                                        phrasing of the resolution. In the meantime <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> (I presume <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Charlie Yost</persName>) had shown our
                                        original condemnation resolution to the French, which meant
                                        that it was also presumably thereafter promptly shown to the
                                        Israelis. Thus, by Wednesday night, the Israelis had seen
                                        our original resolution. By Thursday they had heard that
                                        there was uncertainty about such strong phrasing; by
                                        Thursday night, when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> had returned to New York and was
                                        in negotiation with <persName corresp="#p_CMS1">Michael
                                            Comay</persName> and the Syrians, the Israelis knew that
                                        we had officially backed off from our position.</item>

                                    <item>Thursday night and Friday morning, <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> was negotiating not only
                                        with the British and French, but with the Syrians and the
                                            <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0649"/>Israelis. The
                                        result of the negotiations was the tabling of our resolution
                                        Friday afternoon which emphatically let up on the Syrians.
                                        However, in so doing, the Israelis became increasingly aware
                                        of the fact that our amendments were less and less
                                        satisfactory to them, to the point where the resolution was
                                        less balanced from the point of view of our original
                                        resolution which they had already seen. In short, <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> tried to “escalate up”
                                        with the consequences which we had foreseen.</item>

                            <item>Our resolution was adopted because, for once, the Syrians and the
                                Egyptians were smart enough to realize that a little bit of indirect
                                condemnation of Israel was better than a Soviet veto or no
                                resolution at all. Had the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                                resolution remained and been put to the vote, it would have failed
                                of adoption for lack of votes. However, had that happened, the
                                Soviets would have insisted on incorporating the strong elements of
                                that resolution by amendment into our resolution. Those efforts at
                                amendment would have failed and this would have served as the basis
                                for the Soviets’ vetoing our resolution on the basis that it was not
                                strong enough.</item>

                            <item>A comparison of the two resolutions, i.e., the first that we put
                                up and the one that was adopted, certainly gives basis for Israeli
                                irritation at us, although they had hoped that either resolution
                                would be defeated so that there would be no obligation on the books
                                for them to cooperate with TSO. The lesson to be drawn from this
                                go-around, and in defense of <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>’s
                                position, is that the Israelis, having seen the original resolution
                                and then having seen us back off from it, saw the United States--at
                                least <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>--being patently unfairer
                                by sacrificing substance for tactical considerations with the
                                passage of time in order to get a resolution through. By such a
                                procedure, we initially admit to the significance of internal
                                pressure while ultimately accepting the necessity of being smarter
                                from the point of view of international tactics. From this it is
                                clear that a decision must be made, wherever a Palestine debate
                                occurs in the Security Council, as to what is wisest in terms of our
                                substantive international interests in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We must draft our resolution accordingly, and
                                refuse to negotiate it with either the Arabs or the Israelis.
                                Obviously, the resolution must take into consideration the risk of a
                                Soviet veto, but the willingness to allow internal politics to be
                                injected into United Nations considerations will never satisfy the
                                interested political pressure group, and the net result of trying to
                                oblige it is to offend--to our ultimate detriment in our
                                international relations with Israel and the Arab States because the
                                Arabs are painfully conscious of any Administration’s possible
                                sensitivity on problems affecting Israel.</item>

                                the United States April 10–18 and was in Washington April 11–13.
                                Department of State Press Release No. 224, April 5, outlined the
                                Shah’s schedule during the visit, memoranda of conversations during

                    <p>The President and the Shah retired to the President’s office. The remaining
                        members of the party talked in the Cabinet Room.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State welcomed the Iranian Ambassador and the Foreign
                        Minister and expressed the satisfaction of the United States at this
                        opportunity for the President and the Shah to meet together. He said that in
                        thinking about Iran’s part of the world he had concluded that it was
                        important to all to strengthen the regional relationships of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> area. He mentioned regional disputes
                        such as the Afghan-Pakistan problem and the Kurdish troubles. He requested
                        the views of the Iranian officials as to the political health of the
                        area.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister expressed appreciation for the welcome accorded the Shah
                        and his party. He said that more should be done to build up the solidarity
                        of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. Iran would make certain
                        proposals to this and at the upcoming <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting. It would be good to have periodical
                        meetings of the leaders of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                        countries. In <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0651"/>the case of the
                        regional members, meetings might be held once every month or so.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister expressed his concern that Pakistan Foreign Minister
                        Qadir might not attend the London meeting, since his absence would weaken
                        the meeting, and give rise to reports that Pakistan was losing interest in
                        the alliance. It is known that <persName>Ayub</persName> feels the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> Commander should not be of British
                        nationality, and Qadir’s absence might be interpreted as a gesture of
                        dissatisfaction with the appointment of a British officer to that post.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State agreed that it was important that Qadir attend the
                        meeting. He suggested that, acting individually, the United States and Iran
                        might tell Qadir of the importance of his attending the meeting. The
                        Secretary mentioned that he himself, when he had heard that Qadir was not
                        attending, was undecided whether or not he should make the trip. He had
                        decided, however, to attend. He stated that the United States would inform
                        London and Ankara that we and the Iranians will approach Qadir; the British
                        and Turks might wish to follow suit.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State pointed out that <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> should not be merely a framework for bilateral talks
                        between the United States or the United Kingdom on the one hand and the
                        individual regional countries on the other. The solidarity of the regional
                        members themselves is a matter of real importance, and should spur frequent
                        consultations among the regional members.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Qods</persName>-<persName>Nakhai</persName> expressed
                        the belief that the Ambassadors of each of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> countries resident in each of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> capitals might meet once a month. The
                        Secretary of State said that he intended to invite the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> Ambassadors in Washington to lunch on a
                        mutually convenient day before the London meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State asked the Iranian officials for their views on the
                        situation in Afghanistan. He said that the United States is concerned over
                        the extent of Soviet influence and over the fact that Pakistan’s
                        difficulties with Afghanistan trouble our own relations with Pakistan. He
                        wondered if Iran could do anything to help; and suggested that perhaps the
                        Shah could exercise some influence on both countries.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_QNH1">Qods-Nakhai</persName> said that Iran
                        had sent messages to the heads of both states, but with little effect. A
                        transit agreement has been concluded between Iran and Afghanistan. Iran had
                        demonstrated its good will by offering transport rates that would barely
                        meet costs. Then the Afghans had asked for a free zone in a port. Iran had
                        responded favorably, but the question required further study. Iran believed
                        that Bandar Abbas would be suitable place for such a free zone. Iran is
                        concerned by developments in Afghanistan, particularly by the construction
                        of military airports near the Iranian border. The Afghans plead as an <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0652"/>excuse their troubles with
                        Pakistan, but Iran is of course concerned with this type of
                        Russian-sponsored construction.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_QNH1">Qods-Nakhai</persName> remarked that
                        Iran had always tried to have good relations with the Iraqis. Qasim is
                        having trouble with the Kurds, which concerns all countries in the area. The
                        Kurds of Iran, however, are quite happy and Iran is doing everything it can
                        to improve their living conditions.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister returned to the problem of Afghanistan, noting that
                        Afghanistan represents a danger to Iran because the Soviets are trying to
                        make it a showcase, and Iran is uncertain how long Afghanistan can remain
                        independent under Soviet pressure. The United States and the United Kingdom
                        do not seem to be as disturbed about the Afghan situation as is Iran. Iran
                        finds it difficult to accept Afghan pretensions of friendship while Iranian
                        officials there report that Afghanistan is drifting toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> while professing neutralism. The Afghans
                        are bringing in quantities of military equipment from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and the Soviets are building airports
                        and roads there. The problem deserves special examination by <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Replying to the Secretary of State’s question as to what attitude Iran would
                        suggest that the United States adopt, the Foreign Minister said that it
                        could be argued that any American action could push the Afghans into the
                        grip of the Russians. The Afghans are devoted to their independence and are
                        not inclined toward communism, although they are jealous of Iran and do not
                        want Iran to become too strong. The Americans could advise the Afghans
                        categorically that Afghanistan is following a dangerous policy in relying so
                        heavily on Russian aid; they can be talked to.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State replied that we do advise the Afghans, but that there
                        comes a point at which the relationship between the United States and
                        Afghanistan could be endangered. He asked the Foreign Minister if it was
                        important for the United States to maintain a presence in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that it was highly important for the United States
                        to maintain a presence in both Iraq and Afghanistan. It often appears,
                        however, that in disputes such as the Helmand waters problem with
                        Afghanistan or the Shatt-al-Arab problem with Iraq, the United States gives
                        the impression that it is siding with the other country rather than with
                        Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State remarked that these were examples of a serious global
                        problem for the United States, in that one or both parties in local disputes
                        desire the United States to take an active part in their resolution. One or
                        both parties to those disputes then become angry over the role played by the
                        United States. The Secretary emphasized the <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0653"/>desirability of Iran’s presenting its views at the London
                        meeting with regard to current conditions in the general <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> area.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State then described our uncertainty over the intentions and
                        plans of the Soviet Union, reviewing the current situation with regard to
                        the Berlin and nuclear testing issues. He asked the Iranians if they had any
                        clearer view of Soviet intentions.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_QNH1">Qods-Nakhai</persName> discussed Iranian relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, pointing out that the Russians have
                        adopted a somewhat friendlier personal tone but without any change in their
                        substantive position and with hostile radio propaganda continuing. The
                        Russians have raised with Iran its membership in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. There has been some discussion of an Iranian note or
                        protocol, but at present there is no real contact between the Soviet and
                        Iranian Governments.</p>
                    <p>The President and the Shah entered the Cabinet Room at this point.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he and the Shah had been discussing general questions
                        of bilateral interest. The Shah had asked our impression of the military
                        situation, and the President had expressed the view that no military
                        build-up in Iran would allow Iran to stop a Soviet attack unaided. If the
                        Soviets want general war, the President had said, they would attack the
                        United States directly; thus, the President had said, a very large Iranian
                        Army was not needed. The Shah had expressed concern over the prospects in
                        Afghanistan over the next five years. Further, the Shah, while regarding his
                        armed forces as loyal, had expressed his concern over the anxiety of many of
                        his officers who see the United States giving more military aid to other
                        countries than to Iran, saying that America treats Turkey as a wife, and
                        Iran as a concubine. The President had indicated our strong feeling that the
                        main problem in Iran was internal, and had noted that because of the Shah’s
                        support of a very strong Government in Iran, including a distinguished
                        Foreign Minister and an effective Prime Minister, the Shah had been more
                        successful than in the past in mobilizing support for his long-range goals
                        for Iran.</p>
                    <p>The President said that there were two problems for discussion: how to deal
                        with military matters and how we can help in solving Iran’s economic
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>The Shah thanked the President for his summary, and expressed his concern
                        over the extent of Russian military aid to Afghanistan. He said that Iraq
                        also poses a strange problem--Qasim carries on no economic development and
                        maintains a reign of terror, yet despite his struggle with the Kurds he
                        manages to hang on. The Shah understood that all the Kurdish tribes except
                        one were now united against Qasim, and if Qasim fails to control them great
                        problems would arise. Although the Iranian Kurds are true Aryans, any
                        minority can get restless, and the <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0654"/>security of Iraq could be threatened. Turkey, which has a Kurdish minority
                        of four million, could also be affected. Iran therefore needs more mobility
                        for its ground forces and more aircraft. The Soviets have not intervened in
                        the Kurdish problem, but they might well do so if the situation were to
                        worsen. Many of the <persName corresp="#p_BMM2">Barzani</persName> Kurds who
                        have lived 15 years in the Soviet Union must be Soviet agents. Iraq has much
                        Soviet military equipment, and in the present situation, the result of the
                        Soviet military presence there could lead to incalculable results. Qasim has
                        rejected the hand of friendship extended to him by Iran. Iran’s relations
                        with Iraq are complicated by the situation in the Shatt-al-Arab, where an
                        unfortunate treaty<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">A treaty between Iran and
                            Iraq, concluded on July 4, 1937, recognized the validity of an earlier
                            Iranian-Turkish protocol of 1913 and the Minutes of the Delimitation
                            Commission of 1914, which in turn interpreted the Treaty of Erzerum of
                            1847.</note> has placed control of the river in the hands of Iraq. Iraq
                        could sink a ship in the river and block off Iran’s one major port; Iraq is
                        planning a port on the Persian Gulf which would lessen Iraqi dependence on
                        the river, and is also planning irrigation works which would, by removing
                        water, make river navigation difficult.</p>
                    <p>Syria and Egypt, said the Shah, have switched to Soviet equipment and are
                        receiving massive military assistance from Russia. Egypt has bombers,
                        perhaps 12 destroyers, 9 submarines, heavy tanks, and other matériel which
                        is a subject of great concern to Iran.</p>
                    <p>In Egypt, more troubles are in store. Pan-Arabism did not work; now Egypt is
                        talking Arab socialism, which will also fail, since it runs counter to the
                        Arab mind. When it fails, communism would establish itself in Egypt, and, in
                        order to satisfy the restless Arab peoples, they might be led into some kind
                        of foreign adventure, which Iran fears.</p>
                    <p>The Shah said that Iran has good natural resources and is not overpopulated.
                        With maximum exploitation of its resources and maximum help from other
                        countries, Iran could establish a high standard of living and a powerful
                        economy which could enable it to carry its necessary arms burden.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that the Shah might describe Soviet aid in the area
                        at his lunch later in the day with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
                        The President added that we know the Arab states are unstable, but that a
                        military attack would be directed against Israel, not Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Shah agreed, but added that the Arab leaders wish to take over the
                        Persian Gulf area as well. The Russians cannot out-produce the Western
                        world, but by seizing Middle East oil resources they could cripple the
                        economy of the West.</p>
                    <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0655"/>
                    <p>The President said that the West could survive a seizure of Middle Eastern
                        oil, with some difficulty, by the development of other sources of oil and
                        adaptation to the use of other fuels. The general instability of the area in
                        which Iran is located is a problem of more immediate concern to the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>The President asked the Secretary of Defense to tell the Shah something of
                        our current views on the immediate military and strategic situation of
                        Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense stated that the President had asked him to examine
                        the situation, and that he hoped to discuss his conclusions in detail with
                        the Shah at their separate meeting the next day. In very general terms, we
                        had concluded that the Iranian armed forces are too large and are not
                        properly equipped. We believed it would be wise to reduce manpower levels by
                        about 25 percent; the United States would be prepared to undertake a
                        five-year program for the supply of necessary equipment, if Iran would agree
                        to so reduce the size of its armed forces.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that many Iranian military officers are being
                        trained in the United States, and that they doubt that they are getting
                        first class equipment in the military assistance program.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense said that he understood this concern, and pointed
                        out that in the contemplated five-year plan there were a number of very
                        modern armored vehicles not yet in use by United States forces, and that
                        fighter-bombers not yet even in production might be included in the
                        plan.</p>
                    <p>The Shah asked how the proposed reduction of his forces would fit into <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> planning, which calls for larger, not
                        smaller, forces. He mentioned that so far not a single soldier had been
                        committed by the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> countries for the
                        defense of Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense said that this question could be discussed at the
                        Shah’s meeting at the Department of Defense, and that General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> could comment on it. He repeated
                        the United States view that Iran required not larger forces, but more modern
                        and mobile units.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State remarked that <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                        should not be a framework for bilateral negotiations between the regional
                        allies and the United States and the United Kingdom, but should become an
                        instrument of regional solidarity.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he recognized that Iran would get no help from
                        Pakistan and Turkey if Iran were invaded; those countries would have their
                        own troubles. The United States must convince the Soviet Union that we will
                        protect Iran. Iran had received strong assurances from previous United
                        States Administrations; we endorse these assurances, and the Soviets know
                        that we stand behind Iran.</p>
                    <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0656"/>
                    <p>The Shah said that he could not tell his people and his Army that they do not
                        have a mission to resist Soviet invasion. If the Shah were to take troops
                        away from the northern border, the people would feel that they were
                        unprotected and would therefore try to make contact with the enemy in the
                        hope of being treated well if an invasion occurred.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that the function of the Iranian armed forces is of
                        course to resist attack from any direction. Their armed resistance, even if
                        short, would provide time for other responses, and would be the first step
                        in containing a Russian attack. The United States does not have unlimited
                        resources. But within those resources, the United States wants to
                        strengthen, not weaken, the Imperial armed forces in their capacity to
                        fulfill their role. We give about as much aid to Pakistan as to Iran. We
                        give much more to Turkey, but, as the Shah had said, all Turkey has is its
                        Army.</p>
                    <p>The Shah said that he would be happy to discuss with the Secretary of Defense
                        details of how mobile units could be strengthened. But the necessary number
                        of soldiers must be retained to give the impression that the country would
                        be defended. An Iranian soldier costs only $150 yearly, making the cost of
                        50,000 soldiers only $8 million each year.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked that much more than $8 million was involved, when one
                        took training, equipment, and other expenses into account.</p>
                    <p>The President asked the Secretary of State to speak on the subject of
                        economic assistance to Iran. The Secretary emphasized the importance of
                        economic development in today’s world, and expressed great confidence in the
                        progress being made in Iran under the Shah’s leadership. He said that the
                        United States wanted to give all the help it could.</p>
                    <p>The Shah described and endorsed the Third Development Plan, and noted the
                        dangers of trying to do too much at once, as well as the problem of
                        unemployment raised by the stabilization program. Among the more useful
                        possibilities in relation to this problem would be the construction of
                        housing for government employees as a substitute for pay raises. At present
                        more than a third of these employees’ wages goes for rent. Help in this
                        field would be most useful.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked the Shah’s opinion as to the importance of the Bandar
                        Abbas port project. The Shah replied that this project was dear to his
                        heart, that it would provide a fine harbor, reduce dependency on the exposed
                        port of Khorranshahr, open up an important region of Iran, be important in
                        case of American military operations in Iran, and open up a shorter route to
                        Afghanistan and reduce the Russian danger there.</p>
                    <p>The Shah said he hoped that American development loans in Iran would be for
                        terms of forty years. The President remarked that United States development
                        loan terms were softer than those of other Western <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0657"/>countries, and expressed his desire that
                        United States representatives at future consortium meetings do everything
                        possible to bring the terms offered by these countries in line with our own
                        terms.</p>
                    <p>The Shah said that Iran would require continuing budgetary support from the
                        United States. The President indicated that Iran could expect no such aid in
                        future from the United States, referring to the history of aid legislation,
                        Congressional cuts in requests for supporting assistance funds, and the
                        United States balance of payments’ situation. He mentioned the basic
                        difference between this type of assistance on the one hand and development
                        lending on the other.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> to
                        discuss measures by which Iran could help itself with regard to its
                        budgetary problems. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName>
                        suggested that Iran might unify its governmental, development, and military
                        budgets and recognize their interrelationship, take measures to increase its
                        revenues and mobilize indigenous resources, effect further economies, and
                        improve governmental administration.</p>
                    <p>The Shah replied that although much could be accomplished in time, progress
                        would be slow, and the stabilization program would result in a reduction of
                        national income during the coming year.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question from the President, the Shah said that there was no
                        significant flight of capital from Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense pointed out the interrelationship of military and
                        non-military budgetary requirements, adding that an individual soldier
                        actually costs a great deal more than $150 a year, and that a reduction of
                        50,000 men would save a number of millions annually.</p>
                    <p>The President declared that in matters of foreign assistance our principal
                        problem is the method of distributing our limited resources; we could never
                        do all that we wished to do. However, he hoped to give the Shah, before he
                        left Washington, a definite idea of what the United States could do for Iran
                        over the next five years in the way of military assistance, as well as a
                        more precise picture of the economic assistance which the United States
                        could provide.</p>
                    <p>The Shah brought up the possibility of increasing Iran’s oil sales. He noted
                        that production costs in Kuwait were 21 cents a barrel but were about 27
                        cents in Iran. However, Iran must receive increasing oil revenues if it were
                        to continue to exist, and if Iran ceased to exist, Kuwait’s oil would also
                        be denied to the West. He hoped, therefore, that the United States
                        Government and the major American companies would recognize the importance
                        of increasing Iranian off-take.</p>
                    <p>The President said that if the Oil Consortium could get some special
                        arrangement giving them a price preference on added production increments,
                        or something along that line, we might urge the companies to increase
                        further their Iranian production. He suggested to the Shah that <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0658"/>the Iranians talk to the Department of
                        State, more specifically to Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to see what could be done.</p>
                    <p>The Shah noted that the oil companies had come close to promising Iran a 10
                        percent increase in off-take yearly. The most important thing in talking to
                        the companies was to emphasize that if Iran remains free and stable, the oil
                        will continue to be available; if Iran collapses the companies will have
                        nothing.</p>

                    <p>After introductory remarks, the Shah led off by saying that the key question
                        was whether “<gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> recommendations” were
                        to be taken seriously as a basis for planning or not. He had before him a
                            <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> planning study dated January 5,
                        1962 (<gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CMPS1">CMPS</gloss>/TS.3000/3/2, Joint Campaign Plan--Requirements--Memorandum
                        by the Chief of Staff Combined Military Planning Staff) and read from it at
                        frequent intervals in the early part of the conversation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> countered by saying that
                        our strategic views are based in the first instance on the importance of our
                        nuclear striking <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0659"/>forces as the
                        basic deterrent to Soviet action anywhere against such countries as Iran. He
                        laid before the Shah a table showing the prospective buildup of U.S.
                        striking power, with particular emphasis on an alert status of 15 minutes or
                        better, and thus virtually immune to Soviet neutralization.</p>
                    <p>The table was then reviewed in detail. The Shah raised a question about
                        anti-missile missile claims by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said these were greatly exaggerated, that there was
                        a tremendous gap between achieving a single interception of a shot known in
                        advance and achieving an operational capability in the face of multiple
                        shots, decoy techniques, and multiple warhead possibilities. The Shah then
                        asked about “invisible” missiles, to which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded by saying that there
                        were ways of confusing the radar pickup but any method of eliminating it was
                        “way off” in the future. He said he had no doubt we were picking up Soviet
                        shots, which led the Shah to comment briefly that the US got valuable
                        information from its sites in Iran. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> nodded, and the matter was not further pursued.</p>
                    <p>The Shah asked specifically whether we “still” had nuclear plans to hit the
                        border areas northwest of Iran. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> replied that we did, as part of the over-all
                        master targeting plan.</p>
                    <p>At the close of this phase of the discussion, the Shah reverted at once to
                        his original question--were “<gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                        recommendations” to be the basis of planning? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that in our view the mission
                        of the Iranian forces should be related more to the threat from Iraq and
                        Afghanistan, and that the force level and equipment we would propose should
                        be regarded more as complementary than a part of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> studies.</p>
                    <p>The Shah then made an earnest statement of Iran’s needs, arguing that Turkey
                        and Pakistan could not (or at least would not) earmark any forces for the
                        defense of Iran. He then asked what the role of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> Military Staff Commander was to be. He
                        said that just before his departure Ayub had sent him a message that he,
                        Ayub, was very unhappy over the nomination of a British general for this
                        post, feeling that a British officer would not possibly have the necessary
                        leverage and control over the key US forces. Ayub had gone so far as to say
                        that he might drop out of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> if the
                        nomination were insisted on, rather than an American. The Shah said that
                        Iran did not share this view, but did wonder how the new setup could be
                        effective.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> responded by giving
                        a brief history of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss><gloss target="#t_CCMS1">CCMS</gloss> proposal, pointing out his own part in
                        getting it adopted. He said that there had been talk of modeling the setup
                        on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, but that the present idea did not
                        go so far. It was like <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0660"/>however, in that the Commander did not
                        actually have forces at his command until hostilities broke out. On the
                        question of Turkey and Pakistan, General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> agreed that their difficulty in assigning or
                        earmarking forces was a major one. As to naming an American as <gloss target="#t_CCMS1">CCMS</gloss>, both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> referred briefly to the
                        difficulty of doing so as long as the US was not a member of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Shah then referred to the force level problem and specifically to the
                        proposal for a 150,000 man force level that had been made by the President.
                        He said this ran dead counter to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                        studies, which recommended substantial increases. He then read at length
                        from the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> paper quoting excerpts to
                        the effect that Iran needed much greater forces--and that “US military
                        experts” agreed. Some specific figures from the paper were 12 regular plus 3
                        armored divisions, 300 fighter aircraft (20% all-weather), 24 light bombers,
                        extensive early warning and GCI facilities, and surface-to-air missiles,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>At the close of this reading the Shah asked bluntly whether we were now to
                        shift away from <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, in effect to a
                        bilateral basis of planning for Iran’s forces. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> did not respond flatly in the
                        affirmative, but did state that <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                        plans must be reconsidered.</p>
                    <p>The Shah appeared to take this as an affirmative response that a change in
                        the planning basis was being made. He commented that he could not tell the
                        Iranian people this, and that the new planning basis would depart completely
                        from <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. He then went on to outline the
                        kind of deployment in forces that might be visualized for Iran. This would
                        consist of two parts, the first being “very strong”, well-equipped, mobile
                        forces deployed so that they could cover rapidly either the Iraqi or the
                        Afghan front. The second element would be static forces in the north, less
                        well-equipped and mobile, and designed to fulfill purely a static role.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> commented that we
                        would be prepared to join in a study of such a concept, either through our
                            <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> liaison, through direct contact,
                        or both. He expressed the preliminary view that such a deployment would be
                        more effective than the present one.</p>
                    <p>In response to the Secretary’s question, the Shah indicated that the force
                        levels he had in mind for the second component would be three regiments
                        (equivalent of a division) in the north (presumably in the Tabriz area), and
                        a division in the east. In addition, the division that would continue to be
                        stationed in Teheran would cover the nearby border area.</p>
                    <p>The discussion turned to the specific figure of 150,000 men. The Shah said
                        that it might be necessary to go slightly above this figure in order to
                        avoid giving the Iranian people the impression that their <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0661"/>northern border was no longer defensive.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed that the
                        U.S. could study whatever force level need might exist above 150,000 men in
                        order “to avoid the appearance of complete depletion”. No precise figure of
                        the possible add-on was mentioned. The strong implication of the discussion
                        was that it would be on the order of 10,000 men.</p>
                    <p>In response to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>’
                        questions, the Shah clarified a remark he had made about transferring border
                        guard troops to the Gendarmerie. He made clear that this would be the only
                        major administrative change, and that the two divisions he envisaged being
                        deployed in the north would remain a part of the regular army.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then put before
                        the Shah a formal proposal to send a planning team from the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff to consider with the Iranian Armed Forces their deployment and force
                        levels in accordance with the above discussion. The Shah quickly assented to
                        this proposal.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then put before
                        the Shah a written summary sheet of the proposed military assistance
                        equipment deliveries, mid-1962 to mid-1967.<note n="1" xml:id="d244fn1">Not
                            attached to the source text. For text of the final list entitled
                            “Planned Deliveries of Military Equipment to Iran, July 1, 1962 through
                            June 30, 1967,” see Annex A to <ref target="#d248">Document
                            248</ref>.</note> He proceeded to run down the list explaining each
                        item. With respect to the M–113 APCs, he and General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> stressed that these were the
                        newest and finest, and were available only in limited quantities to U.S.
                        forces. The Shah asked several questions about the characteristics of the
                        M–113 and seemed pleased with the responses.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary also laid stress on Item 4 (vehicles), pointing out that this
                        would deal with the problem of replacing the present World War II vehicles
                        in the Iranian inventory. Here, and at several other points in the
                        discussion, the Secretary stressed that this item was the key to the Shah’s
                        emphasis on mobility for his forces.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Item 7 (H–43B helicopters), the Secretary and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> again stressed that
                        this was a highly modern item that was just beginning to be introduced in
                        U.S. forces.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Item 8 (civic action support), the Secretary expressed
                        pleasure at the progress that Iran was making in this area, and the Shah
                        nodded in apparent agreement and approval.</p>
                    <p>Item 9 (Guchon) and 10 (liaison aircraft) caused no particular response or
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Item 11 (C–130s), the Shah expressed immediate concern
                        whether 4 would be adequate. He then stated that Iran’s pressing need was to
                        augment the present C–47 inventory by 12 additional aircraft for early
                        delivery. (See further discussion below.)</p>
                    <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0662"/>
                    <p>With respect to Item 12 (combat air capability), the Shah questioned whether
                        there should be 13 aircraft per squadron. The Secretary and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> responded that for
                        covering dispersed areas, we believed such a squadron strength was better
                        than a greater number, and that our own squadrons were now following in the
                        range from 15 to 18 aircraft. The Shah indicated that the basic question was
                        whether the total number of aircraft was adequate, but did not pursue the
                        point at this stage.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary specifically called attention to the necessity for improvement
                        in the operational and maintenance efficiency of the Iranian Air Force.
                        General <persName>Katahmi</persName> responded that the maintenance was
                        satisfactory on the F–86s, but had to be done out of the country on C–47s of
                        which only 6 of the stock of 11 were now operational. He said that the
                        I.A.F. had asked <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> for an additional
                        support but had had no response. He conceded that the I.A.F. maintenance was
                        weak on electronics and that the <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>s were
                        not well-trained in this area. The Shah said that as new aircraft were
                        brought in, experts should be sent at the outset to train the Iranians for
                        maintenance, to which the Secretary agreed.</p>
                    <p>In response to the Shah’s question, the Secretary said that the choice of
                        aircraft lay between the N–156 and the F–104–17, that the former appeared to
                        be a highly versatile and satisfactory aircraft, but that the F–104–17 might
                        have certain logistical advantages because of the presence of 104s in
                        neighboring countries. The Shah showed keen interest in the discussion of
                        the characteristics, and particularly in the 1200 mile range of both
                        aircraft mentioned.</p>
                    <p>The Shah then asked whether we envisaged keeping the F–86s in service. The
                        Secretary said that we certainly did, and that we ourselves had deployed
                        F–86s to Europe and were continuing to keep the aircraft as first-line
                        aircraft. The Shah expressed surprise at this, but seemed somewhat pleased
                        and relieved.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that we believed the F–86 to be superior to the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-15 or <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-17. He said that this was particularly true with Sidewinders,
                        and bluntly asked why the I.A.F. did not have its Sidewinders in operational
                        shape. General <persName>Katahmi</persName> referred briefly and vocally to
                        problems of creating storage facilities. The Secretary (here and on several
                        other occasions) stressed that we could not undertake to supply modern
                        aircraft without improvement of the maintenance capabilities of the Iranian
                        Air Force.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Item 12d (staging base in northeast Iran), the Shah quickly
                        picked up the terms and expressed the view that a “full base” was needed.
                        The Secretary said that we could study this problem further, but that the
                        staging base concept was the personal recommendation of General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName>. The Shah expressed a desire to have
                        bases at <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0663"/>both Meshed and Zahadan.
                        He later returned to this same point, and all hands examined the map and
                        agreed that the matter should be studied.</p>
                    <p>The Shah raised the question of protection of airfields, and expressed a
                        desire for surface-to-air missiles for this purpose. The Secretary responded
                        that it was our judgment that this was not the most effective way to protect
                        airfields, but that reliance should be placed upon adequate early warning
                        and adequate numbers of fighter aircraft. The Shah did not pursue this
                        subject more in detail.</p>
                    <p>After completing review of the list, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> returned to the problem of maintenance, both of
                        ground and air equipment, and urged the vital importance of command
                        supervision in this area. General <persName>Katahmi</persName> responded
                        that the in-commission rate of the F–86s were now at a satisfactory 80%, and
                        that 70 pilots were being maintained in a proficient status. He again
                        admitted a weakness in electronics and suggested that “someone on top” was
                        needed. (This appeared to be a suggestion for greater U.S. participation in
                        the electronics training process.)</p>
                    <p>With respect to ground equipment, General <persName>Katahmi</persName> noted
                        that many of the trucks were extremely old and had serious maintenance
                        difficulties as a result.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to the list, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stressed the great qualities of the C–130, and that
                        only limited numbers of this aircraft were now available in our own forces.
                        In summary, he noted that the total proposed list represented an increase of
                        50–75% in the annual delivery rate, over the deliveries of the past two
                        years.</p>
                    <p>The Shah returned to the transport question, pointing out Iran’s vast spaces
                        and stressing particularly his parachute battalion, which he praised highly.
                        He returned thus to the question of 12 additional C–47s. This led to a
                        discussion of the present maintenance arrangements for C–47s, with General
                            <persName>Katahmi</persName> noting that the present basic maintenance
                        performed in Europe was extremely slow. The Secretary agreed that “we must
                        work this out”. General <persName>Katahmi</persName> referred to the low
                        flying time of transport pilots and the short time available for parachute
                        training, and to the difficulty of keeping an adequate number of aircraft in
                        service at one time.</p>
                    <p>The Shah expressed satisfaction at the inclusion of Item 6 (2 inshore
                        minesweepers). The Secretary took the occasion to note that we believed we
                        must cancel the presently proposed two patrol frigates. The Shah expressed
                        unhappiness at this, saying that “if it is vitally necessary, we must find a
                        way”. The Secretary noted, however, that in the event of any extensive naval
                        engagement in the Persian Gulf, the issue would not be decided by Iranian
                        naval forces, and Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> noted the U.S. flotilla at
                        Bahrain.</p>
                    <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0664"/>
                    <p>Responding to the Shah’s reiterated concern on C–47s, the Secretary agreed to
                        look at this question.</p>
                    <p>On the air base question, the Shah queried whether it would be desirable to
                        extend the Tabriz airfield. General <persName>Katahmi</persName> thought
                        this would not be necessary since the proposed new aircraft would have a
                        1200 mile range.</p>
                    <p>The Shah, the Secretary, and General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> all joined in stressing the key importance of
                        early warning. The Secretary made clear that we would need to consult with
                        the British, but that we had in mind a substantial additional effort.
                        Specific locations were not discussed.</p>
                    <p>This completed the discussion of the list. The Shah then related the
                        shortcomings of his armed forces, quoting extensively from a paper (Tab C to
                        the original of this memorandum)<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2">Not attached to
                            the source text.</note> purporting to be a r[sum] of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> findings concerning the Iranian armed
                        forces. This alluded to specific shortages of rifles, automatic rifles,
                        transport for heavy guns and heavy weapons, and maintenance. The artillery
                        situation, however, was judged to be “operable”.</p>
                    <p>The Shah then raised a specific question whether the M–47 tanks held by Iran
                        would continue to be supportable. The Secretary responded emphatically that
                        we did have adequate spare parts and supplies on hand for the foreseeable
                        future and could, if necessary, manufacture more. He noted that we had
                        collaborated only last November with the Italians on arrangements to
                        rehabilitate and furnish the M–47 to Italy. This appeared to surprise and
                        somewhat relieve the Shah.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion, the Shah briefly produced Iranian
                        estimates of the situation of the armed forces of Turkey, Iraq and
                        Afghanistan. These were stated to be the province of General Afkahmi, and
                        the Shah briefly renewed key points (which appeared to be in rough agreement
                        with our own estimates), and indicated that General Afkahmi would wish to
                        discuss these further in his Pentagon appointments the following day.</p>
                    <p>The conversation, which had commenced at about 3:10 was concluded at 5:00
                        o’clock on a friendly note. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked for the return of the discussion lists of
                        equipment deliveries, indicating that we proposed to present this to the
                        Shah in the form of a memorandum of understanding prior to his
                        departure.</p>

                    <p>I had breakfast alone with the Shah at 8:30. He seemed pleased with the
                        contacts he had had, including of course his talks with the President, but
                        somewhat unhappy in his discussions in the Pentagon. He wants more aircraft.
                        He said that if the decision was made because we didn’t have the money, that
                        was one thing. If it was made for strategic reasons, he felt he should get
                        the additional aircraft. When I told him that the Pentagon had been much
                        impressed with the Shah’s own military knowledge, he said, “Well, that’s
                        natural--I have military training”. He said he himself was much impressed
                        with the knowledge of Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, who, he pointed out, had only been in the Defense
                        Department a short time.</p>
                    <p>He said he was hopeful that real land reform would now be forthcoming in
                        Iran, and that following the financial stabilization period through which
                        they were going, the country could again expand its industry. Unemployment
                        was increasing because of the stabilization program.</p>
                    <p>I emphasized to him the importance we placed on his economic development
                        program, as well as his improving his own position with the intellectuals
                        and students in Tehran. I expressed the point of view that his security was
                        based on the support of the United States, not his own military
                        establishment. His greatest danger came from communist infiltration, rather
                        than overt military attack. He took this in good part, and discussed his
                        hopes in the field of economic development. He mentioned the Lilienthal
                        development in the Karun valley.</p>
                    <p>He asked many questions about world affairs, such as the situation between
                        the Soviet Union and Red China, and other developments in Asia. I tried to
                        leave at 9:15, as I knew he had an engagement at 9:30, but he kept me until
                        nearly a quarter to ten. He seemed anxious to talk over all the matters that
                        were on his mind, both domestic and international.</p>
                    <p>He told me he was going to be in The Hague on May 1st and asked whether it
                        would be helpful for him to mention the West New Guinea question to the
                        Dutch Government. I said I thought it might be helpful <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0666"/>and agreed to let him know, through his
                        Ambassador in Washington, just what the situation was at the time of his
                        arrival. I underlined how important we felt a peaceful settlement was to the
                        future of Indonesia and I explained the pressure the Soviet Union was
                        putting on <persName>Sukarno</persName> to use force in which event the
                        Soviets and Red Chinese would give Indonesia assistance whereas we would of
                        course express strong opposition to an aggressive act in the Security
                        Council.</p>

                        should be released later in the day.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense handed the Shah a list of military assistance items
                        reflecting the United States offer to the Shah<note n="2" xml:id="d246fn2">See Annex A to <ref target="#d248">Document 248</ref>.</note> which had
                        been conveyed orally by the Secretary of Defense to the Shah on the
                        preceding afternoon. He explained that there had been certain changes, and
                            <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0667"/>that some C 47 aircraft and
                        some additional ammunition had been added.</p>
                    <p>The Shah examined the list and observed that it should include some SS 11
                        anti-tank missiles. The President instructed the Secretary of Defense to
                        look into the matter in order that the President could discuss it with the
                        Shah the next day at Camp LeJeune.<note n="3" xml:id="d246fn3">According to
                            the President’s Appointment Book, on April 14, the President met with
                            the Shah and Vice President Johnson at 2:24 p.m. during his tour of the
                            U.S. Marine Corps base at Camp LeJeune, North Carolina. (Kennedy
                            Library) No record of the conversation has been found.</note></p>
                    <p>The Secretary explained that ammunition reserves had been calculated on the
                        standard 30-day <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> reserve level. The
                        Shah indicated doubt as to whether a 30-day level was adequate for Iran,
                        which is far away from sources of supply. The Secretary said that he had
                        checked the question with General Norstad, who felt the 30-day level was
                        adequate: Iran would be built up to a 30-day level before the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries reached that goal.</p>
                    <p>The President referred to a conversation the previous evening with the
                            Shah,<note n="4" xml:id="d246fn4">During the evening of April 12, the
                            Shah and Empress <persName corresp="#p_Farah1">Farah</persName> hosted a
                            State banquet for President and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> at the Iranian Embassy in Washington. No record
                            of conversations held during the banquet have been found.</note> and
                        stated that he was interested in the police situation, which was a difficult
                        problem in many countries. The United States would make an analysis of
                        conditions in European countries and elsewhere and would take the matter up
                        with the Shah again. The President might take this function of building
                        police capabilities out of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and make it a
                        responsibility of the Defense Department. The President and the Shah agreed
                        that it is an important problem.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of the economic development program in Iran, the President said
                        that, like the Shah, we are pinning great hopes on the program, and that we
                        desire to help. In order that we can contribute and in order that we can
                        assist in getting together a consortium of other contributing nations, it is
                        important that the details of the Plan be put into the best possible shape.
                        The formation of a Consortium is not easy; the effort failed once in the
                        case of Pakistan, and another attempt was necessary. Great care is therefore
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>The President said that nothing contributed so much to the Shah’s prestige as
                        Iran’s economic development program. The President congratulated the Shah
                        for having found such an excellent Prime Minister and for supporting him in
                        his efforts. We are very interested in cooperating with Iran in the field of
                        economic developments as far as our resources would permit; it is very
                        important to get the other Western nations to help Iran.</p>
                    <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0668"/>
                    <p>The President noted that he, the President, could leave his present job and
                        the United States would go on, but Iran would collapse if the Shah were to
                        leave his post. The President assured the Shah that he had the support of
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Shah acknowledged the importance of this point, and noted that he had
                        been working for twenty years at the task of building a strong
                        anti-Communist society through social reform and economic development. But
                        even if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did not exist, he would
                        still have a duty to work for the progress of the Iranian people. The Shah
                        remarked that he felt responsible to the majority of his people and he
                        cannot belong to the few. The President interjected that the few can take
                        care of themselves. The Shah replied that this was true, although things
                        were being made a little harder for them now.</p>
                    <p>The President told how Franklin Roosevelt was still regarded almost as a god
                        in places like West Virginia, because Roosevelt, though a rich man, had
                        worked for the interests of the common people. Referring to the current
                        trouble with the steel companies, he said it was necessary to identify
                        ourselves with the small people, and he was aware that the Shah had done
                        precisely this. This particular thunder must be taken away from the
                        Communists. He wanted the Shah to realize the depth of his feelings on this
                        subject. Life is a burden, but unless the Shah survives, Iran and then the
                        whole Middle East would crumble.</p>
                    <p>The Shah stated that this concept was the goal of his life, and that he had
                        devoted his life to this end. He gathers strength from seeing that Iran is
                        moving forward. To succeed on the economic side Iran needs time and
                        security. These last elements will be provided by the bilateral agreement
                        with the United States and by the existence of revamped armed forces which
                        will give Iran the prestige it has needed. The Iranian people expect
                        strength from their government. Iran needs an honest, first-class army with
                        a decent standard of living. With such an army Iran can resist Communist
                        pressures and build the country into a showcase so that other peoples can
                        see that it is possible to work with the West and get more effective support
                        than countries such as Egypt receive.</p>
                    <p>The President told the Shah that he wanted the content of their exchanges to
                        be perfectly clear, in order that there should be no feeling later that
                        their meaning had been misunderstood. Therefore he wished to remark that he
                        did not believe it was possible to make Iran a showcase immediately. Even
                        here in the United States, we still have many problems, such as
                        unemployment. We have fiscal limitations, and we cannot give as much as the
                        Shah would wish. But we will do the best we can and will press other
                        countries to help. He emphasized that the United States is far from being a
                        showcase—we still have unemployment, educational problems, and many other
                        problems yet to be dealt with.</p>
                    <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0669"/>
                    <p>The Shah said that by the term “showcase” he had meant only a comparative
                        improvement. He wondered why Iran’s efforts looked better now than they had
                        in the past.</p>
                    <p>The President surmised that this interest and support for Iran was due
                        partially to the fact that Iran has picked its enemies and partially to the
                        fact that it has picked good people to work on the main problems. The
                        situation in Iran is obviously improving.</p>
                    <p>The Shah agreed and remarked that he is not by nature a dictator. But if Iran
                        is to succeed its government would have to act firmly for a time, and he
                        knew that the United States would not insist that Iran do everything in an
                        absolutely legal way.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed that there are always special factors that have to be
                        taken into account in different countries. We are aware that the Shah is the
                        keystone to the arch in Iran. Iran’s progress will depend on continuing
                        recent efforts—it will be necessary to keep the heat on those who do not
                        accept the national interest and take their money out of the country.</p>
                    <p>The Shah said that some people had become unjustifiably frightened of the
                        stabilization program and had taken their money out of Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Shah asked if it would not be possible for Iran to take more advantage of
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 assistance, and noted that Iran
                        needs substantial supplies of wheat now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> said that Iran’s request for 100,000 tons of Title I
                        wheat represented no problem, and that a further request, which he
                        understood was coming along, for 100,000 tons under Title II would be given
                        prompt consideration.</p>
                    <p>The Shah pointed out that <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 wheat was
                        also important in that it generated local currency which could be used,
                        among other purposes, to provide low cost housing for civilian and military
                        employees of the government. The President suggested that we might consider
                        devoting all the local currency generated by the forthcoming wheat shipment
                        to such housing rather than spending it on a variety of scattered projects.
                        He said <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> should check on the
                        possibilities. He also asked <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> to assist
                        the Iranian government in obtaining information on recently-devised methods
                        of producing inexpensive housing, such as had been used in Brazil and
                        Venezuela.</p>
                    <p>The Shah spoke of his interest in utilizing special Army battalions to
                        further civil economic development programs. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> mentioned that we had a Corps of
                        Engineers headquarters in Iran, and that there are plans to expand civic
                        action programs there.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if the Shah had any advice as to how the United States
                        should cope with its problems and responsibilities. The Shah replied that he
                        felt the United States was doing very well indeed, and that the Communists
                        will be defeated in this way.</p>
                    <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0670"/>
                    <p>The President said that as a politician he would like to emphasize that
                        national leaders must identify themselves with the common people. The
                        President said that he knew this was the Shah’s course, and that politically
                        it is the most successful course.</p>
                    <p>The Shah replied that he had been working at this very problem for many
                        years, and that it is his life. For example, he had been jailing people for
                        corruption for two years, but that it was only being noticed now.</p>
                    <p>At this point Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and
                        Caroline entered the office for a brief visit with the Shah before he had to
                        leave for his Press Club speech.</p>

                    <p>In opening the conversation and inviting the Shah to comment on any issues
                        which he wished to pursue further following his conversations in Washington,
                        the Secretary remarked on the favorable public <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0671"/>response which both the Shah’s visit and Iran’s progress in
                        the economic and social fields had made in this country. He believed that in
                        a very real sense the U.S. and Iran were partners, and wished to know if the
                        Shah agreed, what the Shah’s plans were, and how the Shah felt as a result
                        of his visit.</p>
                    <p>In response, the Shah stated that he had tried to be as clear as possible in
                        all his conversations in Washington. Obviously speaking extemporaneously, he
                        continued that his primary problem was how to promote social justice in
                        Iran, and also how to utilize the untapped as well as the existing wealth of
                        the country, agricultural and/or industrial. The aims are to raise per
                        capita income, and to secure for the country a posture of both plenty and
                        social justice. On one side, there was the question of state development to
                        provide an incentive to his own people for investment. This they were doing:
                        for example, there was a five-year tax exemption. There was also legislation
                        providing a favorable climate for foreign investment. On the side of social
                        justice, there were problems as regards land and labor. In the latter
                        sphere, he was thinking of some formula to make labor shareholders in
                        factories, or perhaps to give them a share in profits. As regards government
                        employees it was not just a question of pay raises: housing was essential.
                        He was also thinking of cooperatives or something in the nature of a
                        civilian PX. The essential thing was not to force the civil servants to be
                        dishonest. If their living conditions were improved, then he could be hard
                        on them in the case of dishonesty.</p>
                    <p>The Shah continued that this was all part of what he described as “positive
                        nationalism.” This was true of Iran’s foreign relations as well. This policy
                        was based not on hatred but rather on friendship. He then turned to
                        Iranian-United States relations and said “that is the basis of our relations
                        with you, we are not your stooges.” What the Shah was trying to put across,
                        he said, was that it is possible to cooperate with the West. As he had
                        mentioned the day before to Congress, the Shah’s policy is based on
                        friendship with the Western powers. He then said he hoped that this policy
                        would also be instructive as regards the African countries. They should not,
                        as some were obviously doing, base their policies on hatred. Returning to
                        his own internal problems, he said that what was necessary was to speed up
                        development and raise the standard of living rapidly. He referred to the
                        Soviets’ 20-year program enunciated at the 22nd Party Congress. We have
                        great chances, he continued. Essentially Iran is stable; we have had no
                        serious upheavals. We have a tradition of stability. For example, my trips
                        throughout the country are eloquent witness of the response of the people.
                        There is no possibility, so far as I am concerned (“perhaps your information
                        services have information to the contrary”) that in the absence of outside
                        intervention there will be any upset. It has not happened in Iran as it has
                        happened <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0672"/>elsewhere. This raises the
                        question why? So far as the Shah could see, it was the brave start his
                        father had made. For his own part, he thinks it is because as both King and
                        Commander-in-Chief of the army he has kept the army and politics separate.
                        Internally, this involved several interwoven problems. On the one hand Iran
                        had a good plan, and is working toward social development. They had good
                        administration—although admittedly it needed revision. On the other hand,
                        there was the need for security. This was as much psychological as anything
                        else. Iran’s borders must be secure. This was accomplished both through the
                        bilateral with the U.S., and through the Iranians’ own will to resist. It
                        was necessary, however, to give a firm impression to the people. They don’t
                        need to know the details, but must know that the borders will be defended.
                        Therefore the Shah could not allow himself to withdraw completely his
                        military elements from the northern borders lest, among other things, the
                        fear of occupation induce the people to establish contact with the Russians
                        even before they come.</p>
                    <p>Turning to his neighbors, the Shah remarked that Turkey, Pakistan and other
                        countries depend on their armed forces. “We, however, have the institution
                        of the Crown. We also have strength—I don’t want something fantastic, but
                        something worthwhile.” This helps boost morale. Internally reforms must be
                        made. Sometimes measures are unpopular, for example constitutional reform.
                        As he had told the President, personally his character had nothing of a
                        dictator in it: in the long run dictators cannot last. But he must give his
                        people the base on which to build. The Shah then alluded to the Belgian
                        constitution, and said that if it was merely a question of a piece of paper,
                        this could be adopted overnight. But it must be built, beginning in the
                        village councils and on up, through the parliament. As regards parliaments,
                        Iran had had one for many years. The Shah had never personally suffered from
                        it; in fact he regarded it as the foundation of the state. This is not
                        enough, however. In his view he could not permit the constitution to impair
                        Iranian unity. “If it does so, let’s forget about it.” The Shah hasn’t
                        forgotten it: “perhaps in just a few months time I may be forced to have a
                        parliament.” But this should not come first. “I must put first the high
                        interests of society and my people.” He thought he was making progress. He
                        also thought he was having a desirable influence on his neighbors.</p>
                    <p>This line of thought led the Shah to dwell on the Afghan situation, which
                        concerned him “seriously.” More and more the Afghan economy was falling into
                        the Russian orbit. The Iranians were trying to help; they were offering the
                        Afghans trade routes for many reasons, including their own benefit. This was
                        one of the reasons the Shah was particularly interested in Bandar Abbas. A
                        cardinal interest in Bandar Abbas was military as it would permit help to
                        reach him more rapidly in the case of necessity. It would also have the
                        additional advantage of offering the <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0673"/>Afghans facilities. As for Iraq, unfortunately he just did not understand.
                        For the last two years both the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the
                        U.S. had told him the uncertainty would be “finished,” but so far as he
                        could see the situation just continued to deteriorate. Just before he left
                        Iran he was told that 12,000 Kurds were united in opposition to Baghdad. So
                        far the Soviets had not gotten in, but if the situation gets out of hand,
                        “if next summer the Kurds pass to the offensive,” then possibly the Soviets
                        might be tempted. “We must therefore be on our watch, especially since we
                        have Kurds, as do the Turks—incidentally the Kurds are the purest Persians,
                        pure Aryans, from their tradition, their language and their history.” In
                        Iran the Kurds have had no local success, as they have had in Iraq. The Shah
                        is endeavoring to help them by building roads, schools, hospitals,
                        electrifying their villages, paving their streets, building silos.</p>
                    <p>As regards Turkey, “our strong ally, and for which we have only real
                        fraternal affection, I hope we need not worry,” the Shah continued. But,
                        because the country is now divided and there is strong political hatred,
                        because the army is now in politics, it is worrying. The army should be a
                        national army, drawing strength from all sections of the country and all
                        walks of life. But the Shah hoped that Turkey could pull through.</p>
                    <p>As regards the Arab world, “perhaps it is pure prejudice, but I just don’t
                        like them.” Therefore we have some apprehensions, particularly when we see
                        them talk about the “Arab gulf.” The Shah was referring to all the Arab
                        countries except Jordan, Lebanon, which is not a military power, and Saudi
                        Arabia. All the rest have switched to Russian arms. They have either sent
                        their people to the Soviet Union, or have accepted missions of experts in
                        the hundreds. Thousands of Egyptians have gone to Russia or Czechoslovakia,
                        officers of the air force, navy, etc. Iraq also has the same policy—“It is
                        true they are divided, and there is not much chance they can get together.”
                        The Shah was sorry to say it, but his feeling was that if the President of
                        Egypt “gets what he wants, he might be a source of danger.” He has started
                        Arab socialism, “which cannot succeed;” it is not compatible with Arab
                        nationalism. But what happens when it fails? The Shah had the feeling that
                        “we, who are the open and declared allies of the West—we should succeed. I
                        am sure that you want also to see your friends succeed.” He concluded his
                        remarks by stating that he had not mentioned Pakistan because the Iranians
                        really had no problems with the Pakistanis.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thanked the Shah for his comments, which contained many
                        elements of solid interest, and were very important to us. He wished to
                        speak first of what the Shah referred to as his policy of “positive
                        nationalism,” which he interpreted as meaning independence of national
                        policy in friendship with the West. We were “entirely comfortable” with such
                        a policy. That is just the way we think the <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0674"/>international community should be organized. Our view of
                        the world community was well stated in the opening passages of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. We were not seeking satellites as
                        allies. As regards the neutrals, their very independence could be a source
                        of concern to us. In a certain sense the U.S. was never less sovereign than
                        it was today. Its responsibility has limited its freedom of action. He was
                        reminded of a remark a friend had made to him that in an international
                        negotiation, two countries could never reach accommodation unless each fully
                        understood its own interests.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the Shah’s allusion to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s 20-year plan, he quoted Adenauer as being
                        amused at “the luxury of being able to announce a program concerning which
                        you would not have to answer any questions for 20 years.”</p>
                    <p>Regarding the Shah’s remarks on the Arab world, we looked at the possibility
                        of an Algerian resolution as perhaps presenting new opportunities both for
                        France and for the Western powers. Algeria has been the worst problem. Of
                        course, on the other side there was also Palestine which, together with
                        Algeria, is the only unifying element in the Arab world. The Secretary
                        continued that we are not completely discouraged with the direction of the
                        Arab-Moscow relations; sometimes the temperature goes up, sometimes it goes
                        down. Arab temperament and Arab nationalism are such that we thought they
                        would cause the Soviets as much trouble as they have us and would in fact be
                        a bar to the Soviet ambitions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then commented that the most important element was the sense of
                        security. This was where Berlin was vital. Perhaps the Shah would like him
                        to expand on the Berlin problem—unless the President had done so that
                        morning. The Shah acknowledged that they had touched on Berlin, but not at
                        length, whereupon the Secretary continued that Berlin was the principal
                        issue over which a major clash could occur. The Soviets had been making
                        insistent demands, which “cut right across the vital interests of the West.”
                        Since June, in fact since the President and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had met in Vienna last summer, it had seemed that
                        the harsh Soviet line was designed to intimidate the West. This had led to
                        the President’s July 25th demand to the Congress to increase our defenses.
                        Since mid-September, it had seemed that the Soviets had been more moderate.
                        In fact there was some evidence that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had perhaps been a little surprised at the degree
                        of the President’s reaction. As regards his own talk with Gromyko, on
                        substance, that is on the merits, there had been no significant headway.
                        There had been, perhaps, a change in the atmosphere and mood. The Secretary
                        could be wrong, and it could change tomorrow, but he felt that the Russians
                        were not driving toward a crisis or a diplomatic impasse.</p>
                    <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0675"/>
                    <p>The Berlin situation could affect Iran in two major respects, first if there
                        were a major clash—and the Secretary here emphasized that “We will not be
                        driven out, for the consequence of that would be just as disastrous as a
                        major engagement,” and we have been trying to make this known to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. Secondly, it would weaken the
                        Shah’s position if we were weak in Berlin. If we are able to interject a
                        note of caution in Soviet thinking in this respect, it could be reflected in
                        their conduct in Southeast Asia and regarding Iran.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the economic, social development side, the Secretary continued
                        that the U.S. is very much interested in Iranian progress. The Secretary
                        understood that the Shah’s plan would be ready in June. There would then be
                        a consultative group under the Bank, “with the maximum U.S. interest in
                        enlisting the efforts of a number of countries, in September.” There was
                        also the question of how to maintain the momentum before other countries
                        undertook commitments. In this respect, there were a number of things that
                        could be done: for example, Bandar Abbas, where we hoped to be able to
                        respond favorably to a loan application somewhere in the order of $20
                        million for foreign exchange costs. There were a number of other things that
                        could be done. The Secretary had only two remarks to make. First, we are
                        trying, and he asked the Shah “not to be understandably cynical too soon”—we
                        are trying to establish a mechanism to make decisions more rapidly. This was
                        basically a question of good administrative practice: the Secretary found it
                        amusing that we were encouraging the Iranians to improve their
                        administration at a time when we were also working in the same direction.
                        The Secretary was trying to concentrate decisions in two places; with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>, who would on the
                        basis of his expert knowledge of the local scene, and in consultation with
                        the Iranians, make recommendations, etc. The second focus was with Messrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Hamilton</persName> here in Washington: these two
                        elements working together should be able to make decisions promptly.</p>
                    <p>The second remark the Secretary wished to make was that we recognize that
                        international consultation may be cumbersome. But in the next decade we
                        foresaw that the West would be developing common policies with regard to aid
                        to less developed countries. For example, <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> was a symbol of this cooperation. There are nations who
                        are already devoting to international development portions of their gross
                        national product comparable to that devoted by the U.S., and in total
                        somewhat more: this to development, not to military assistance. What we must
                        do is to mobilize the resources of the free world for the long term: this
                        was where the Iranian program was important. We propose to work with you and
                        the International Bank. First there will be consultation no later than
                        September. In the meantime, we must manage to maintain momentum. For this
                        purpose we are prepared to entertain applications <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0676"/>for development loans during the period
                        before the plan is finally prepared. The Secretary wished to know whether
                        this approach fit the Shah’s thinking and approach to the problem. There was
                        a very considerable number of things in which we are interested, but the
                        Secretary did not believe it necessary to go into detail. It was basically a
                        question of how best to use our own interest in Iran for its maximum
                        leverage on others.</p>
                    <p>In thanking the Secretary for his remarks, the Shah stated that U.S. policy
                        was a great comfort to him, to his people and to the region. He continued
                        that he knew and accepted U.S. policy. Even when the U.S. was not directly
                        concerned, it was interested in justice, international standards, etc.
                        Therefore he looked to the U.S. For a long time Iran had been suspicious of
                        the Western powers, particularly Britain and Russia. Therefore, in the First
                        World War Iran had been pro-German. But now Iranian policy had switched to a
                        pro-West policy, and had every prospect of remaining so. Iran endorses U.S.
                        policies. The Shah therefore understands the sense in which we agree with
                        his “positive nationalism.”</p>
                    <p>As regards the Arabs and the Secretary’s remarks concerning a possible happy
                        outcome to the Arabian problem, the Shah commented that he had friendly
                        personal feelings towards DeGaulle and believed these were reciprocated. He
                        had first warned DeGaulle about Algeria in 1959, pointing out that he was
                        the only one who could resolve the issue. (The Secretary commented that this
                        was “extraordinary counsel.”) The Shah was happy that the situation was
                        improving, and envisaged that this would bring the Moslems together,
                        particularly the Algerians and the Tunisians. He agreed that thereafter Arab
                        nationalism would focus on Israel, but pointed out that Egypt did not “want”
                        a solution. As he was coming to the U.S. this time, at the Beirut airport,
                        the Lebanese Prime Minister had commented that it was now necessary to
                        resolve the refugee problem, along the lines of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution. The Shah had not given him a direct answer, but
                        Lebanese informants had told him that it was essential that the U.S. induce
                            <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to get together. To an interjected
                        question by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> as to whether
                        this had been recently, the Shah replied that it was perhaps indiscreet to
                        say so, but in fact this had been said by the Lebanese Ambassador in Tehran
                        on March 21.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, Japan and economic growth
                        in the West, the Shah continued that he had long told many of his European
                        friends that they “could no longer get rich on the U.S.” As regards Iran,
                        foreign powers could not just sell to Iran: they must invest in order to
                        secure foreign markets. “Otherwise we will attract capital and you will
                        suffer. We will offer favorable markets to those who invest capital in
                        Iran.” The Shah was of the opinion that the European nations were inclined
                        to help—perhaps not to the extent that the U.S. and he wished, but in any
                        event to <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0677"/>help. He then commented
                        that, broadly speaking, the price of industrial imports tended to increase
                        each year, whereas the prices of agricultural exports were declining. This
                        was very difficult for a country like Iran, with an increasing population.
                        With respect to aid, the Shah had talked to the President, who seemed to
                        have liked the idea that Iran should take more and more <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480. The possibility should be explored to
                        the maximum. This would help him combat the rise in prices of agricultural
                        commodities. Iran’s problem was complicated, of course, by a bad harvest. To
                        this, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> commented that we are
                        in agreement to the extent that there is a need.</p>
                    <p>The Shah then commented, in reference to <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>,
                        that the Iranians had decided to have an over-all budget. He continued that
                        Mr. Asfia was having talks with various competent people in Washington. He
                        was not aware of the details, but he assumed they were helpful. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Hamilton</persName> agreed that there had
                        been very helpful talks. In the course of this exchange, the Shah made a
                        remark to the effect that the talks had been useful “to the extent that you
                        are willing to give us the same kind of help you are extending to India and
                        Pakistan.” He continued that “surely we will tax, we wish to tax,” but this
                        is not a good year to start. Furthermore, the stabilization program made it
                        difficult. Following a comment by the Secretary that he believed that the
                            <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> was coming to Iran in May in
                        connection with stabilization, the Shah continued that it was also necessary
                        in the long term to make the oil companies grasp the situation in order to
                        have stability. Iran should “remain the bastion guarding the gateway to the
                        Middle East.” Therefore, it was “in the oil companies’ interests that we
                        should stand firm. They should see to it that our production is boosted;
                        particularly when there is a choice of where to increase, they should
                        naturally favor us.” This is especially so when others have so much income
                        they don’t know what to do with it, for example Kuwait. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> interjected that it was difficult,
                        because they were not the same companies, for example, in the gulf. To Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>’s statement that we
                        understood that the Shah was going to talk with the members of the
                        consortium, he said that he talked with them regularly. Just a month ago he
                        had received five or six of them. They have promised to increase revenues 7
                        to 10 percent this calendar year. This, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> commented, would compound rapidly, and the Shah
                        remarked that if they continued to increase up to perhaps 12 percent, it
                        would naturally be of great importance.</p>
                    <p>To Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>’s comment that as the
                        President had said, we intended to talk to the oil companies—what success we
                        would have is questionable, however—the Shah remarked that he thought they
                        would be favorably disposed since the Iranians were not causing them
                        troubles, as was for example Iraq. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> suggested that perhaps the Shah <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0678"/>could speak to them more forcibly,
                        directly, than could we, and the Shah acknowledged that that might be
                        true.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then addressed himself to the
                        Shah’s comments regarding the adverse developments in terms of trade. We
                        were thinking now not only in terms of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> but also the over-all general development in this respect.
                        In many items Iran was simply not competitive. After some discussion on
                        Iran’s competitive position, particularly with Greece and Turkey, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> continued his explanation of
                        the broad lines of U.S. policy. We were seeking free trade without
                        preferential agreements. We were talking with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, and others seeking to eliminate preferential
                        treatment and substitute commodity arrangements on a global basis. These
                        were clumsy and difficult when perishable items were concerned. The U.S. is
                        attacking the problem directly on an item basis, for example, coffee, cocoa,
                        and minerals, seeking both stabilization in price, and income stability.
                        From the point of view of terms of trade as such, the Shah was right. We are
                        aware of the problem of the rise in industrial prices and can understand the
                        Iranian anxiety regarding the Common Market. As regards our own trade
                        policy, we had two points: (1) the most favored nation approach and (2) our
                        new trade legislation. The latter would provide free access for certain
                        tropical products and perhaps would be available for some Iranian products.
                        In any event, we were very actively working on these problems. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed that over a period of time it
                        could be serious if aid were vitiated by price fluctuations. He could give
                        no assurances; it was a very complex problem but we were working on it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then turned to military questions, referring to the Shah’s
                        conversations with the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. He handed the Shah an aide-mémoire and annex,<note n="1" xml:id="d247fn1"><ref target="#d248">Document 248</ref>.</note>
                        which he described as “secret and setting forth our understanding of the way
                        the talks went, at least of what we said.” It set forth what we were to do.
                        The Secretary wished to underline that the program reflected therein was
                        intended to strengthen the Shah’s military posture. For a while we had
                        concentrated on manpower levels, but now we were seeking modernization,
                        mobility, and the strengthening of firepower. We had felt that the military
                        discussions were very helpful. The Shah asked if he could read the document,
                        which he did. In response to the observation that we understood that when
                        the Shah and the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had talked last evening, one or two other matters
                        were mentioned, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        was to consider them and that the President and the Shah were to talk about
                        them tomorrow, the Shah remarked that they would not necessarily alter the
                        annex to the aide-mémoire materially. There <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0679"/>was a question of the SS–11 guided anti-tank missile, but
                        that would not change the list very much.</p>
                    <p>The Shah continued that he would naturally be very glad to receive the
                        planning team to consider the reorganization of his forces. Although he
                        personally agreed in the light of the fantastic retaliatory power that he
                        had seen during his visit, and since also the Soviets know that any attack
                        would mean war (but also that Iran could not defend effectively),
                        nevertheless this did represent a completely new approach. It was different
                        from <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, and that was a problem for
                        him: how to explain to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, and what
                        would be its effect on the military committee? The Shah could not comment on
                        that. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> interjected
                        that this reflected precisely what the Shah had been seeking: more mobile
                        forces, and greater striking power. Military plans were never static, and
                        there should be no difficulty in explaining it. The Shah continued that
                        stationing of these new units would be a problem which must be studied. He
                        must also study the “static forces which we have to keep in the north in
                        order not to give the impression that we are abandoning our territory. Well,
                        this is a new approach, in any event.” As he understood it, the material
                        reflected in the annex “is for the rest of our conventional forces.” To
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>’ comment that there
                        would be less concentration and more emphasis on transport and mobility, the
                        Shah replied that these questions must be studied. He did not mind cutting
                        his forces but there was a question of mobility and of the mechanization of
                        these units, for example, personnel carriers and tanks. He did not know
                        whether these questions had been taken care of. In any event, the team could
                        discuss these matters. The Ambassador continued to point out that with
                        smaller forces there would be more concentration of equipment—a greater
                        density, and the Secretary noted that substantial training was also
                        involved. This the Shah had not thought of, but continued that the important
                        question is that “This is not the result of discussion—this is your
                        approach. We cannot, of course, force you, but we can tell you if we agree.
                        I recognize I cannot force you, but I do know that you are fair enough to
                        let us tell you if we do not think this is sound.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> noted that the Secretary of Defense
                        was prepared to send a team immediately and thus get things moving, which
                        the Shah acknowledged. Regarding the Air Force, the Shah noted “You
                        naturally tell us what you are willing to give, but let us see and study.
                        There are questions of targets and ground support. We must see if it is
                        adequate, then we would have the sentiment of having studied and told you
                        our point of view.” Nonetheless, the Shah had the feeling that, short of
                        atomic weapons of course, “you want us to have a hard-hitting mobile and
                        modern force.” The Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> acknowledged that this was our joint objective, and
                        the Secretary directly asked the Shah if he did not wish modernization. The
                        Shah said he did, and <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0680"/>raised the
                        question of timing, to which the Ambassador responded that we would act
                        immediately if we can.</p>
                    <p>There was then some talk about the question of training, it being pointed out
                        that it took three years to make a pilot. The Shah noted that while he had
                        men to fly the planes today, there was the problem of ground personnel. And
                        maintenance, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>
                        interjected, continuing that as he understood it, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would send for <persName corresp="#p_HMGJC1">General Hayden</persName> immediately. The General
                        would go into the problem of organizing a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> group which would then go out to Iran to study these
                        matters. The Shah said that he would receive them himself. He noted that he,
                        of course, would have to make the decision and that it would not be a
                        popular one—general staffs always exaggerate their needs. The Secretary
                        noted that in this regard general staffs always wanted bigger and better
                        forces, it was something like Parkinson’s Law. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> summed up by saying that if the Shah
                        were agreeable we could proceed on this basis, and the Secretary
                        acknowledged that the Shah must know before he could prepare his budget. The
                        Shah then raised the question of radar, noting that while the British were
                        supplying some equipment, the Iranians themselves were doing all the
                        construction, which seemed to him onerous. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> noted his understanding that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had undertaken its radar construction
                        in the north. As he understood it, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was thinking of early warning in other directions,
                        and the question of numbers of stations was also involved. To this the Shah
                        acquiesced, noting that he had been amazed at the detailed knowledge that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> possessed. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> noted that it was
                        important that we not compete with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        since after all we were all allies.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then raised <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, noting
                        that there was the question of international military headquarters. It
                        seemed to us increasingly that there was a question as to whether there
                        should be theoretical or real planning. This we had noted in many alliance
                        organizations, including <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. We were trying to direct matters towards real planning.
                        We must also direct our thinking towards what would be real contingencies,
                        not just theoretical possibilities. He felt that <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> must review its planning with this thesis in mind. In
                        this general line of thinking the Secretary hoped to have very frank and
                        intimate talks with his Foreign Minister colleagues at the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> meeting. He therefore felt it very
                        important that the Pakistani Foreign Minister attend. Acknowledging the
                        significance of such attendance, the Shah said he would try to help, and
                        turning to the Foreign Minister, asked him to draft an appropriate message.
                        Turning back to the Secretary, the Shah commented that he had already
                        informed him of a message he had received from Ayub. The Shah said that he
                        had spoken to Ayub regarding a U.S. Commander-in-Chief, telling him that
                        while he recognized his <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0681"/>reasons for
                        wishing an American, this was no reason to refuse a British commander. Why
                        hurt the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> for nothing? “I will now tell him
                        that if he wants more military assistance, from my talks here I do not think
                        it will help” to have an American. To this the Secretary commented that the
                        nationality of the Commander-in-Chief would have no bearing whatever on U.S.
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> policies, and the Shah repeated that
                        he would send Ayub a message. He continued “I have already tried, but …
                        maybe.” The Secretary, stating that he was speaking privately, not for the
                        Pakistanis but for the Shah’s information, remarked that the psychology of
                        our own people made it desirable not to have an American commander. We had
                        already Commanders-in-Chief in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                        Atlantic Command, Sixth Fleet; we had substantial forces in Turkey;
                        substantial forces in other regions. We had the Seventh Fleet in the Far
                        East. We had several thousand military men in Vietnam, and in that area we
                        were now having casualties every day. It was important for the U.S. people
                        to see that the U.S. was not the gendarme for the world. A <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> general for <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> would help in this respect. We wished our allies to help
                        more everywhere. We would like the Australians to help in Vietnam. We are
                        prepared to meet our fundamental commitments everywhere and anywhere there
                        is a major confrontation. “We are entirely serious in this.” But the U.S. is
                        unique in having so many forces elsewhere in the world. What we need is more
                        of a mixture of our allies.</p>
                    <p>The Shah said he understood, and also that he recognized that it would have
                        no effect on <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. “But in the same trend of
                        thinking,” he continued, “if the U.S. is sure of some countries and certain
                        of their will and capability to resist, surely the U.S. would wish them to
                        take some part of its responsibilities. There would thus be less and less
                        need for the U.S. to undertake such responsibilities short, of course, of
                        total war.” The Secretary acknowledged that this was our hope. There
                        followed an exchange on the relative cost of maintaining a division, the
                        Shah noting that it cost the U.S. some $250 million a year, whereas an
                        Iranian division cost much less. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> commented that this was a figure for a combat
                        division during the Korean war, including ammunition and equipment. The
                        Secretary continued that for the time being of course there was a need for
                        our physical presence in many places, to register our commitment. He then
                        told a story of Vishinsky and a U.S. businessman. In response to the
                        businessman’s comment that Vishinsky must recognize that the U.S. people
                        would never permit an attack on the Soviet Union, Vishinsky had averred that
                        he could not rely on this. Look at Korea, he said “didn’t you tell us—didn’t
                        you do everything you could to tell us—that you were not interested, and
                        then look what happened!” To this the Shah commented that his concern was
                        not to give the Russians a situation, be it economic or military, of
                        weakness which might lead them to temptation. He might add, in connection
                        with the <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0682"/><gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> assuming a little more responsibility, that it was his
                        impression that the British were revamping their military planning, and
                        gravitating south of Suez. They were building up Aden and some place in
                        Africa. He speculated that perhaps they wished to assume more responsibility
                        in that area, noting that it was “OK with us.” The Foreign Minister
                        interjected that they might be contemplating the necessity of leaving
                        Cyprus, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> noted
                        their interest in Kenya. To the Secretary’s acknowledgment that they had
                        major interests in the general area of the Indian Ocean, the Shah concluded
                        that what they required was some sort of a base between Malta and
                        Singapore.</p>
                    <p>The Shah then asked the Secretary’s opinion regarding the prospects for
                        disarmament. The Secretary began his reply by expressing the hope that his
                        colleagues would not hear of his response, but frankly while there would be
                        lots of discussion, there was one utterly fundamental point on which no
                        agreement could be reached: inspection. Secrecy and disarmament were utterly
                        incompatible. The Secretary continued at some length to discuss the history
                        of the testing discussions, and the breakdown over inspection. Gromyko had
                        noted to him that one man on an inspection team could conduct espionage of
                        vital significance to the Soviet Union. Noting that the inspection we had
                        proposed in connection with testing did not provide “a farthing’s worth”,
                        the Secretary indicated that no progress could be made, although he foresaw
                        that we would go ahead talking, perhaps in moderate terms. Noting that the
                        point we had now reached was that we could inspect what had come to be known
                        as the “bonfire,” but nothing else, he opined that the Soviet position
                        defies logic. To the Shah’s speculation as to Soviet motivation and his
                        suggestion that they might be afraid to expose their weakness, the Secretary
                        said that one or two of the satellites with whom we were talking had in fact
                        suggested the Soviets were concerned about a disclosure of weakness. This of
                        course might change, but we felt that the Soviets had reached a basic
                        decision last summer to make a major new effort in the missile and nuclear
                        field. They had resumed testing for a sound military reason. We therefore
                        must conclude that for the present at least they have no intention of making
                        progress. The Secretary then asked the Shah if he might have a few words
                        with him in private and the meeting broke up, with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> taking the Foreign Minister to his
                        office as arranged for a separate chat.<note n="2" xml:id="d247fn2">The

                            aide-mémoire to the Shah during a conversation that began at 2:30 p.m.

                    <p>His Imperial Majesty the Shahanshah of Iran and Secretary of Defense
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert S. McNamara</persName> held a
                        discussion on April 12, 1962, concerning the defense problems of Iran.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, on behalf of the
                        United States Government, expressed the following views:</p>
                    <p>The United States Government believes that the basic force level of the
                        Imperial Iranian Armed Forces should be 150,000 men. The United States
                        Government recognizes that a static force above this level may be required
                        in minimum strength to preserve a visible defensive posture in the northern
                        border areas of Iran and is prepared to undertake a joint study to determine
                        the size and equipment of such a force.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government is prepared to send a military planning team
                        from the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff to Iran, to consider these
                        questions and to consult generally with Iranian Armed Forces concerning
                        their plans and military deployments.</p>
                    <p>In conjunction with the proposed force level stated above, the United States
                        Government is prepared to make a firm undertaking to deliver military
                        equipment to Iran over the period July 1, 1962 through June 30, 1967, in
                        accordance with the attached Annex A to this aide-mémoire. This firm
                        undertaking would, of course, be subject to the approval of the United
                        States Congress for annual appropriation requests of the necessary funds.
                        The United States Government believes that, in the light of the present and
                        future strength of its own strategic retaliatory and non-nuclear forces,
                        together with the measures being taken to improve their mobility, the above
                        force level and proposed equipment supplies for the Imperial Iranian Armed
                        Forces would make these forces substantially more effective than at present
                        for the purpose of carrying out their missions. The United States Government
                        notes that the proposed equipment deliveries would constitute a major
                        increase in the delivery levels of the past two years, and would provide for
                        the first time a clear understanding of military assistance plans over a
                        five-year period.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>This is the report you requested on the size of the current <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 programs in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Food-for-Peace programs in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> have been
                        large because of Egypt’s increasing dependence upon food imports to meet its
                        growing needs. Egypt was traditionally a food exporting country, but the
                        rapid growth of population, combined with a restricted supply of arable
                        land, had forced her to import large amounts of food in recent years to
                        supplement local production. This increased need from abroad put an
                        increasing burden on the nation’s foreign exchange reserves which were badly
                        needed for economic development purposes. The <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 program, especially through Title I, has contributed
                        much to satisfying these needs and has made a major contribution to the
                        economic development program in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. By
                        saving scarce foreign exchange reserves, which would ordinarily be used to
                        purchase the required food, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was able
                        to purchase capital goods from hard currency areas, including the U.S., and
                        thus become less dependent upon assistance from the Soviet Bloc to meet its
                        capital needs.</p>
                    <p>While the program was expanded considerably in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962, this was due largely to severe crop failures which
                        sharply increased the country’s needs from abroad. The program, which began
                        in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 under Title III (donations to
                        voluntary non-profit agencies), was interrupted in 1957 and 1958 following
                        the Suez Crisis and revived in later years under <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0686"/>Titles I (sales for foreign currencies) and III. In 1961,
                        severe insect infestation and abnormal flooding of the Nile reduced output
                        sharply in the agricultural sector. The production of corn, which provides a
                        part of the farm population with the main ingredient for its bread, was down
                        20%. Wheat production remained about the same but in recent years the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has been able to produce only about half of
                        its requirements. Cotton production declined about a third and supplies of
                        edible cottonseed oil fell far short of requirements. Exports of cotton
                        normally account for about 70% of the country’s foreign exchange earnings.
                        The decline in the cotton crop alone represents a potential loss of $100
                        million and has compounded the chronic problems of foreign exchange
                        shortages. To help alleviate these conditions, the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 program was expanded. As a result, the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 program rose almost $80 million to about
                        $180 million. While the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 program is
                        expected to decline with improved crop conditions, Egypt’s needs are still
                        expected to total about $140 million.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> was to point out that,

                            States hoped that Israel would listen to Johnson with an open mind and
                            be flexible in considering his suggestions, as the Johnson initiative
                            offered a unique opportunity to remove a major element of instability in

                            remind the Israelis that the United States had assured Israel that it

                            economic interests and that Johnson would not propose, nor would the
                            United States support, unilateral concessions by Israel. (Ibid.,

                        not expect sudden resolution refugee problem but stressed importance of
                        seeking forward movement. He assured <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> anew US would resist proposals which would jeopardize
                        Israel’s vital interests.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said he could repeat assurances
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> had given US
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> in meeting earlier
                        thirteenth of open minded reception for Johnson. He added progress wholly
                        dependent on Arab attitude and asked whether démarche to Israel would be
                        duplicated to Arabs. Secretary replied US will do everything practicable
                        ensure Johnson receives full hearing.</p>
                    <p>Secretary invited <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>’s forecast
                        area developments as influenced, among other things, by Algerian settlement.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> expressed pessimism stating
                        even before end of Algerian situation Israel had <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0688"/>observed hardening attitudes among Arabs and sensed
                        comparative calm recent years might soon end. He referred to <persName corresp="#p_BBA1">Ben Bella</persName>’s declarations that Israel is
                        Arabs’ next target and he would contribute 100,000 men to cause. In rising
                        current of hostility, according to <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>, it important not to encourage Arabs even by such
                        unconscious acts as equating Syrian and Israeli declarations. Syrian threat
                        to exterminate Israel is in simple justice not to be equated with Israel
                        assertion of determination to defend itself against aggression. Secretary
                        observed that in such era as <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                        envisaged Israel might be well advised cooperate to fullest extent with
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as source great political
                        strength.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> declared this is exactly what
                        Israelis are doing, and had done in recent Tiberias troubles. He criticized
                            <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>’s performance and definition its
                        responsibilities. Citing <persName corresp="#p_VHMGCC1">Von
                        Horn</persName>’s suggestion Israel had not given him adequate access, he
                        declared <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> has much greater freedom of
                        movement on Israel’s side than Syria’s, where observers are not permitted to
                        move fifty yards beyond their stations. He expressed resentment with
                            <persName corresp="#p_VHMGCC1">Von Horn</persName>’s alleged practice of
                        describing facility as absolutely imperative and then making public issue of
                        this requirement. When Secretary asked him elucidate, he referred to <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> boat on Tiberias. According to
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> there no need for boat
                        because tiny Lake Tiberias can be adequately “covered” from shore stations.
                        Violence is not from vessel to vessel but from shore to ship or ship to
                        shore. In second place Syrians are making determined effort obtain rights to
                        Tiberias and introduction <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> boat would
                        be regarded by them as great advance. Secretary asked if <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> thought in fact that boat would
                        impair Israel’s claims, <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                        replying probably not except for Syrian aspirations. He complained also
                        about <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>’s recent use of stickers on
                        their vehicle windshields describing themselves as road patrol regulating
                        traffic of their vehicles on Israel roads.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said he would like to ask informally if Israel in its relations
                        with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would not be wiser in long run regard
                        it as an ally and try to grant its requests unless such concession
                        materially affected Israel. Secretary said suggestion made in all
                        friendliness on basis his own personal experiences. In relations with other
                        governments he supposed at least once weekly US Secretary of State could
                        take umbrage at attitudes or requests other governments. US had learned to
                        try not let problems develop in this atmosphere and instead do what needs to
                        be done. He observed psychology of Israel’s relations with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is most important both to Israel and its
                        friends if Middle East is in fact moving into new era increased tensions.
                        Impression US public opinion has of Israel’s relations with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is important to Israel’s security.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> described Israel as wedded to
                        principles of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and cooperating with it but
                        on basis of <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> having understanding of
                        its role. He was particularly critical of <gloss target="#t_ISMAC1">ISMAC</gloss>, asserting it should not be umpire <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0689"/>keeping record of balls and strikes; its
                        job is keeping borders quiet, which is easier of accomplishment by
                        diplomacy. (He broadly hinted <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> might
                        function better if headed by civilian with military advisor.) Israel
                        prepared rejoin <gloss target="#t_ISMAC1">ISMAC</gloss> at any time Syria
                        will drop demand for consideration D/Z status as agenda’s first item.
                        According to <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>, this is not
                        unreasonable requirement inasmuch as General Riley, former <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> Chief of Staff, ruled in 1951 that
                        disputes about D/Z were to be referred to him rather than <gloss target="#t_ISMAC1">ISMAC</gloss>. He made usual reference to
                        Lebanon-Israel <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> as model which should
                        provide pattern for all others. It meets, he said, to correct difficulties
                        not to engage in futile exercises as to where responsibility lies.</p>
                    <p>Secretary remarked <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> may have
                        misunderstood him. He had not meant to suggest specific relations with
                            <persName corresp="#p_VHMGCC1">Von Horn</persName> or <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> but <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        and all its agencies as complex with which it Israel’s advantage to
                        cooperate. It difficult to escape conclusion there is element of pugnacity
                        in Israel’s attitude.</p>

                        which could be drawn upon in response to complaints and inquiries.</p>

                    <p>The Syrian complaint centered on an Israeli raid in force, launched from
                        within the Demilitarized Zone on the night of March 16/17. Israel <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0690"/>counter-claimed a) that Israeli
                        fishermen and police patrol boats on Lake Tiberias had been fired upon by
                        the Syrians and b) that Israel’s political independence had been threatened
                        in statements by high officials of the Syrian Government.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Background</hi></p>
                    <p>The Lake Tiberias region is a particularly sensitive one because: a) Syria
                        has traditionally been particularly and vigorously anti-Israeli and is
                        determined to resist Israeli encroachments in the Demilitarized Zone and b)
                        the Arabs are agitated about Israel’s plan to withdraw Jordan Basin waters
                        from Lake Tiberias in late 1963. Israel alleges absolute sovereignty over
                        the entire lake. In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>’s request, the Legal Advisor is preparing and will
                        shortly transmit a thorough legal exposition of the position of the U.S.
                        Government on this question of sovereignty.<note n="1" xml:id="d251fn1">A
                            paper entitled “United States Government Position Concerning Sovereignty
                            Over Lake Tiberias and the Withdrawal of Water Therefrom,” drafted by
                            Hewitt on April 16, is ibid., Central Files, 683.84A/4–1662. It
                            indicates: “The United States Government considers that while Israel
                            presently possesses exclusive rights of jurisdiction and control over
                            Lake Tiberias, sovereignty over the lake has not yet been finally

                        sensitive regarding anything which might conceivably be construed as
                        derogating from their claim of absolute sovereignty over the Southern
                        Demilitarized Zone and the lake. Thus, they have rejected proposals for the
                        stationing of an <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> patrol boat on the
                        lake and have refused since 1951 to participate in the Mixed Armistice
                        Commission which was set up under the General Armistice Agreement (Tab A) to
                        cope with complaints regarding breaches of the Agreement.</p>
                    <p>Israel had been called before the Council four times previously for making
                        retaliatory raids. Israel was specifically condemned by the Council for a
                        similar Tiberias raid in 1956 (Tab B).</p>

                    <p>Our major aim during this exercise was to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> peacekeeping machinery in the field and to
                        encourage the parties to cooperate more fully with it so as to render the
                        recurrence of such hostilities unlikely. In order to prevent the Soviets
                        and/or the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> from pre-empting the
                        situation and to give us the maximum degree of control over the outcome, we
                        and the British decided to sponsor a reasonable, balanced, and constructive
                        resolution.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary sent to the President on March 28 a memorandum outlining the
                        projected U.S. position (Tab C). A proposed resolution was enclosed. On the
                        basis of the <persName corresp="#p_VHMGCC1">von Horn</persName> report (Tab
                        D), reports from our <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0691"/>posts in the
                        area, and consultations with the Israelis, friendly Council members and Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>, <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> drafted the preliminary U.S. statement, which was cleared
                        in the Department and delivered by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> on March 28 (Tab E). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> was informed by you that we should
                        proceed along the lines of the memorandum, and <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> was authorized to proceed accordingly (Tab F).</p>
                    <p>In keeping with the Council’s previous stand on retaliatory raids, in our
                        original draft resolution the Israeli attack of March 16/17 was explicitly
                        condemned. However, adequate balance was provided by a paragraph which would
                        have held “that the hostile actions from Syrian territory of March 8” were
                        clearly violations of the cease-fire. Although the presumption is that
                        Syrian provocation took place, <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> was
                        unable conclusively to determine where the responsibility lay for initiating
                        the several fire exchanges which occurred prior to the Israeli raid. In
                        response to questions put by members of the Council General <persName corresp="#p_VHMGCC1">von Horn</persName> made further observations on
                        April 4 (Tab G). A major reason for the fragmentary nature of <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>’s information was the denial by both
                        parties of sufficient observational facilities and freedom of movement to
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis made energetic representations at all levels, including a call
                        by their Ambassador on the Secretary on April 2 to persuade us to desist
                        from supporting a condemnatory resolution (Tab H). Consultations with the
                        Israelis in New York, Tel Aviv and Washington were frequent and frank
                        throughout.</p>
                    <p>Despite the fact that we had urged the Israelis not to bring into the Council
                        debate the contentious question of sovereignty over Lake Tiberias their
                        representative explicitly reaffirmed their assertion of sovereignty in two
                        statements before the Council. It was determined by <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> that it would be tactically undesirable for us publicly to
                        take issue with Israel on this aspect of the problem in the Security Council
                        debate.</p>
                    <p>In light of the consultations conducted with regard to the resolution, the
                        Department reconsidered its original draft. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> was given discretion to
                        negotiate within a range between a strong version and a milder one (Tab I).
                        He decided to use the milder version as the basis for further negotiations
                        and so informed you and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAMJ1">Schlesinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis, who were obviously acquainted with our first draft, should have
                        been pleased that we decided to pursue a milder resolution. Meanwhile,
                        however, more background information became available, publicly and
                        privately, from General <persName corresp="#p_VHMGCC1">von Horn</persName>,
                        who had come to New York at our suggestion, and from sources in the field.
                        Inter alia, this information strengthened doubts about who had really
                        provoked whom in the fire exchanges prior to the Israeli raid. <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> came <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0692"/>to the conclusion, with which the Department concurred,
                        that a factual justification for charges that the Syrians bore exclusive
                        responsibility for initiating the hostile exchanges simply could not be
                        made. Consequently the resolution took on a less “balanced” if more
                        objective cast, in order to reflect more accurately the ascertainable facts
                        and accordingly to make it more viable in the Council. Naturally, the
                        Israelis were disappointed about these last changes. You will note that in
                        our major statement (Tab J) we took the Syrians seriously to task for
                        raising the level of fire in the March 8 exchange.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, we were as responsive to Israeli suggestions about the resolution
                        as the facts of the situation warranted. For example: (a) the resolution
                        does not newly and directly condemn Israel, but rather reaffirms the
                        Council’s position on retaliatory raids; (b) in response to Israel’s second
                        complaint, an operative paragraph calling upon both Governments to refrain
                        from the threat as well as the use of force was added to our original draft
                        and later the phraseology of this paragraph was changed to make it even more
                        satisfactory to the Israelis; (c) we eliminated a direct call upon the
                        Governments to exclude their armed forces from the Demilitarized Zone and
                        reduce their forces in the Defensive Area; and (d) we changed another
                        paragraph so that the emphasis would not be solely on the reactivation of
                        the Mixed Armistice Commission, but also on the Armistice machinery. Points
                        (a) and (d) were major changes. At the last minute, we also made a
                        “technical” change at Israeli request by deleting reference to the
                        Demilitarized Zone as the “Syrian-Israeli” <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss>. In retrospect it seems fair to say that despite its allegations
                        of great unhappiness about the outcome, Israel got more of the changes it
                        wanted in the resolution than it had good reason to expect. (Tab J(1))</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Council Action</hi></p>
                    <p>The US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> resolution as approved by a vote of
                        10 to 0 with France abstaining constitutes, in our view, an evenhanded
                        approach to the March incident and a constructive directive for future
                        action by <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> and the two parties. The
                        vote was a convincing demonstration of the value of our taking the
                        initiative in such cases. The completely one-sided Syrian draft resolution
                        (Tab K) was not even pressed to a vote.</p>
                    <p>We regarded it as very important that the Council adopt a reasonable
                        resolution. If the Council had failed to pass a resolution, which was the
                        outcome the Israelis indicated they would have welcomed, the Council would
                        have: 1) failed to exercise any restraining influence; 2) in effect condoned
                        Israel’s deliberate policy of retaliatory raids; and 3) failed to support
                        and strengthen the United Nations machinery on the ground. The net result
                        would have been to increase the risk of renewed hostilities.</p>

                    <p>The Shah received a copy of the Aide-Mémoire<note n="1" xml:id="d252fn1"><ref target="#d248">Document 248</ref>.</note> covering his conversation
                        with the Secretary of Defense. This Aide-Mémoire (a copy has been
                        transmitted to the White House) gives details of the proposed five-year
                        military assistance program to Iran and the conditions affecting its
                        implementation. The Shah indicated that he wished to consider it and discuss
                        it with his own people and give his opinions later. Since we do not yet have
                        a clear assurance from the Shah or his Government that he agrees with our
                        proposals, we will proceed at present only with the planning element of our

                        maintain momentum in the planning process in the meantime. We will continue
                        our efforts to bring about agreement between the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and Iran on the Third Economic Plan. We will act to
                        complete arrangements for a project loan on the Bandar Abbas project. We
                        will also study the possibility of using <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>

                        multi-national financial consideration and to provide Iran with assistance

                    <p>210. Following message relayed at request Dr. Johnson:</p>
                    <p>“For <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Johnson saw <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> two hours Sunday,
                        three hours Tuesday morning and at his request 45 minutes Tuesday afternoon.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName>, Rafael, <persName corresp="#p_AS6">Arad</persName> present all three sessions, Yahil and
                        Rosenne at first two.</p>
                    <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0696"/>
                    <p>Johnson presented ’some ideas’ based essentially upon his Working Paper
                            Five.<note n="1" xml:id="d253fn1">Dated April 2; see Supplement, the
                            compilation on the Arab-Israeli dispute. See also <ref target="#d237">Document 237</ref>.</note> Specifically he (1) spoke of seeking
                        expression of refugee preference with safeguards envisaged that paper, and
                        (2) asked under what conditions Government of Israel would agree to
                        repatriation of a share of perhaps 20,000 as a beginning of movement.</p>
                    <p>On latter, reply was in essence Israel must have as minimum simultaneous
                        public assurance satisfactory to her that Arab governments are prepared to
                        live in peace even if not to sign peace treaty. An evidence of such
                        intention would be six months moratorium on anti-Israeli propaganda. Israel
                        stands on FonMin’s Knesset and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> [garble]
                        statements that Israel has never said ’not one refugee.’ While burden of
                        lengthy and repetitive argument was in essence: no place for them, why
                        should they wish to come, and especially, given present Arab government
                        attitudes as Israel reads them, even Israel’s share of 20,000 a security
                        risk. Apparently unpersuaded by Johnson argument that some million
                        discontented refugees a greater security risk.</p>
                    <p>At the third meeting Johnson (1) expressed disappointment, (2) regretted
                        essentially negative character of response, and (3) declined to assent to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> request expressed in second
                        session not to mention ’poll’ of refugees on other side. FonMin did not
                        again allude to last point. She said she failed to understand Johnson’s
                        disappointment. She and colleagues were manifestly determined, despite
                        Johnson’s reiterated denials, to interpret his approach as threat to
                        Israel’s security, and complained of unequal pressures on peace-seeking
                        Israel. Also characterized his suggestions as ’mechanical’ solution ignoring
                        political fundamentals.</p>
                    <p>Given character Israel reaction Johnson did not develop brief allusion to
                        compensation made in the first talk.</p>
                    <p>At conclusion he asked serious consideration his ’suggestions’ before he
                        returned, probably 5–6 or 10–11 May (he plans not to be in Israel on
                        Independence Day 9 May despite cordial invitation). He did not seek
                        interview this visit with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> who is
                        on vacation but was assured without asking that Ben-Gurion wanted to see him
                        next month.</p>
                    <p>Despite evident absence of meeting of minds conversations were generally
                        cordial in tone.</p>
                    <p>Johnson left Jerusalem by car Wednesday planning spend evening in a kibbutz,
                        night at Tiberias, and arrive Beirut 19 April at noon.”</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> reviewed the
                        improvement of U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> relations since
                        1958 and the importance of a free and stable Egypt which he described as
                        unaligned in the domain of the Free World. He stressed the value of avoiding
                        issues on the question of Israel and maintaining tranquility in the area. He
                        noted the quiet which had prevailed for more than three years except for the
                        recent incidents, because of which, he said, both sides must be strongly
                        counseled to avoid recurrence. He defined the essential goals of Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>’s mission as follows:
                        (a) agreement with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> for a
                        stabilization program during the present visit; (b) agreement on a
                        multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 sales program; (c) U.S.
                        support for and help in organizing a consortium to meet the current foreign
                        exchange problem; and (d) U.S. help for a consortium support of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> ’s longer term economic development.</p>
                    <p>In welcoming Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>, the
                        Secretary confirmed the serious interest of the U.S. in relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> The nonalignment of Egypt causes
                        the U.S. no concern. The U.S. interest is in the security of a society of
                        independent states. He observed that the Ambassador had put the points in an
                        appropriate order of priority. If a stabilization arrangement can succeed,
                        it will open the way for other things.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> noted that discussions
                        with the Fund had been prolonged and the problem of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> is immediate. He believed the two or
                        three points of difference with the Fund were negotiable. He stressed the
                        value of assistance given at the right time and hoped for good offices of
                        the U.S. with the Fund. The current payments gap, including the cost of
                        trade liberalization under a stabilization program, would be about $120–$130
                        million of which up to $60 million might come from <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> arrangements, leaving the balance for a consortium.</p>
                    <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0698"/>
                    <p>A consortium for the current foreign exchange problem was essential but so
                        too was assistance for the economic development program. Social and
                        humanitarian problems of Egypt would not permit postponement. The planned
                        eight per cent annual growth rate might be debatable but however much
                        progress was to be made, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> would
                        need foreign loans and other assistance. There were available credits and
                        offers from a number of countries, but organization and rationalization of
                        the approach was needed as well as verification of the availability of
                        additional funds. The development program problem was not so much one of an
                        immediate requirement for expenditure as of assuming the basis for going
                        ahead.</p>
                    <p>In response to the Secretary’s question, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> gave first priority in the development program to
                        industry, including communications, electric power and the like, noting that
                        these involve greater foreign exchange costs than does agricultural
                        investment. Agriculture, however, could not be expanded as rapidly. Although
                        land reclamation was in progress, gains in this area were dependent on
                        availability of increased water from the High Dam about 1967.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the U.S. was prepared to help on the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> stabilization program. Following some
                        discussion of priorities and level of needs, the Secretary stressed that the
                        U.S. has been pressing its friends abroad very hard to increase their aid
                        and that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> should understand that
                        development of consortium support would mean effort on its part. He asked
                        whether there had been discussions with other capitals.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> noted
                        recent efforts to improve relations with various European countries,
                        including release of the French Mission members and negotiations for
                        settlement of claims with Switzerland and Italy. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> also acknowledged the validity of
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName>’s comment that development
                        consortia should be headed by an international agency and that the recipient
                        country had to be prepared for considerable probing into the soundness of
                        its economic plans. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>
                        recalled that he had participated in detailed negotiations relative to the
                        proposed High Dam consortium and knew the potential of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the implications of this type of
                        approach. The Ambassador stated that, while the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> would do its part, a gesture from the U.S. side was of
                        critical importance.</p>
                    <p>Discussion of a multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 sales
                        arrangement brought out that there was no objection in principle by either
                        side although details might take a little time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CHR1">Cottam</persName> noted that an interim arrangement to
                        ensure continuation of wheat supplies might be desirable and that
                        consideration of this possibility has already been initiated.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the Secretary said he wished to talk with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> again before his departure. The
                        U.S. side would do all it could for positive steps during Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>’s visit and hoped he would leave
                        encouraged by the results.<note n="1" xml:id="d254fn1">On April 20, Dr.

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> replied that they were
                        contacting Germany, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Italy and Japan. In
                        the case of France, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> did not yet have
                        diplomatic relations. However, the Ambassador suggested sounding out the
                        French in view of the more favorable prospects in Franco-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0702"/>
                    <p>In concluding the discussion of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>’s mission, the Secretary re-emphasized the
                        importance of <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> leadership in the
                        long-term development area. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>’s report reinforced the Secretary’s impression of
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Black</persName>’s deep interest in Egypt’s
                        future. If the Bank was able to move forward, this was a good sign. Although
                        the Secretary’s intended conversation with various <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ministers regarding short-term payments assistance would
                        naturally be in the framework of its long-term problem, he did not want to
                        step out ahead of the Bank at this time in any specifics of a possible
                        long-term consortium.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary concluded that he was especially pleased that there had been
                        achieved on both sides a high degree of clarity on what lies ahead.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> expressed his
                        happiness that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>’s
                        mission had been a success and now foresaw the way to resolution of many
                        difficult issues. The Secretary responded that he hoped the Ambassador would
                        take quiet satisfaction in this outcome.<note n="3" xml:id="d256fn3">A

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> noted that the subject matter
                        of the present meeting was closely related to arrangements the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was negotiating with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and inquired as to status of these
                        talks.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> said he believed the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> side had now come to agreement with
                        the management of the Fund and he expected to sign a letter to Managing
                        Director Jacobsson today confirming proposals for a financial program. He
                        hoped for early approval of the arrangements, including a standby agreement
                        by the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Board, perhaps as early as April
                        30. There were some remaining problems. While approval of a quota increase
                        is expected, Mr. Jacobsson was most reluctant to present a proposal to the
                        Board which prejudged the quota increase. As things were now, therefore,
                        standby would provide for drawings of $42.5 million over a nine-months
                        period. There was also the problem of whether the $30 million gold
                        collateral drawing due next January would be converted to the longer term.
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> had talked with various
                        Fund directors, including the U.S. representative, Mr. Southard. He
                        commented that Mr. Southard had been very helpful.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> said the U.S. side certainly
                        hoped that the remaining difficulties would be resolved satisfactorily,
                        inasmuch as the U.S. program which he would describe was based on the
                        assumption of an appropriate program with the Fund and availability of those
                        resources.</p>
                    <p>Since the meeting on Monday, the problem presented by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> side had been reviewed very carefully in
                        terms of what the U.S. could do and a program had been discussed with and
                        approved by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. Since the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> side had discussed project
                        requirements as well as the current payments problem, the U.S. program
                        proposals were addressed to both. On the basis of projects discussed and
                        understandings as to priorities in point of time, the U.S. would be prepared
                        to finance projects totaling $51.3 million in the coming approximately one
                        year—or through USFY 1963. This total was composed of the Cairo West Power
                        Plant-$31 million; the cardboard plant-$5 million; the Bagasse plant
                        expansion-$5.3 million; and another possible $10 million for diesel
                        locomotives. With respect to the latter, it was noted that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had mentioned up to $25 million of diesel
                        locomotives but that $10 million would meet the requirement during the next
                        year. The $10 million <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0704"/>specified
                        would be either <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> or Export-Import Bank,
                        dependent on further consideration. The <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                        loans (excluding the possible financing of diesels by ExImBank) would,
                        according to present loan policy, be for 40 years with a 3/4 per cent
                        service charge and no interest and would carry a 10 year grace period. The
                        U.S. willingness to finance these projects was necessarily subject to
                        appropriation of the funds by Congress since most of these would probably
                        not be ready for final approval before USFY 1963. The loans would of course
                        be subject to normal <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> criteria as to
                        engineering, feasibility, etc.</p>
                    <p>It was also proposed to utilize $5 million of the outstanding loan to the
                        Industrial Bank toward the foregoing projects since these funds had been
                        lying idle for some time and the prospects for the Bank’s utilizing them
                        appeared very limited. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>
                        thought he might like to retain some of the funds for the Industrial Bank.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> indicated he was entirely
                        agreeable to deferring decision on this point. It was agreed that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would respond within a month.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> then turned to the question
                        of funds for the stabilization program. He recalled that it was difficult to
                        fit emergency requirements of this nature into the pattern for which U.S.
                        assistance funds were available. Also this had come at the end of the fiscal
                        year when funds were limited. After careful review, however, the U.S. was
                        prepared to loan immediately upon conclusion of arrangements with the Fund,
                        $20 million to be used for specified types of commodities to be purchased in
                        the United States. It was understood that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would do its best to obtain further funds from other
                        Western countries and the U.S. would do what it could to support these
                        efforts. In addition, if contributions of other Western nations to the
                        stabilization fund exceed $20 million, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                        will in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 match the excess dollar for
                        dollar up to $10 million, subject to availability of funds. The terms of
                        this possible additional loan would be identical with our first $20 million
                        loan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> emphasized that for
                        the U.S. to make all or part of the matching $10 million loan, the financial
                        contributions of other countries would have to be new money. Diversion of
                        existing credit commitments by other countries, such as Germany, would not
                        be counted. It was also desirable to set a time limit on getting commitment
                        of contributions from others. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> asked for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>’s views. After some discussion it was agreed that
                        the U.S. offer of an additional loan up to $10 million would be open for
                        four months after the agreement with the Fund had been concluded. The terms
                        of the commodity loan would be ten years at 2–1/2 per cent with three years’
                        grace. This was clarified as three years’ grace plus seven years’ repayment,
                        to total ten years. In connection with the terms, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> noted that emergency balance of
                        payments assistance and support of stabilization measures could not be
                        considered within the same criteria for terms as development type loans. He
                        mentioned that the last <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0705"/>loan of
                        this type for a stabilization program in the area had been for five years at
                        5–3/4 per cent but in recognition of the economic problems of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, the U.S. had endeavored to be as liberal
                        as possible in setting the terms for this loan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> asked if it might not be
                        possible to make the initial loan for $30 million with the understanding
                        that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would make maximum effort to
                        obtain contributions from other countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> stressed that an integral part of the U.S. program was
                        the inducement to other countries to contribute. He noted that the U.S. was
                        greatly interested in promoting the consortium of Western nations to provide
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion of the status of the various projects. Mr. Williams
                        noted that Westinghouse engineers left for Cairo two days earlier to prepare
                        feasibility studies needed by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>. Their
                        task would be expedited by maximum cooperation of the qualified authorities
                        in Cairo. Feasibility study on the cardboard plant had been received and was
                        now being reviewed. The U.S. had financed the first part of the Bagasse
                        plant and familiarity with the project would facilitate feasibility study.
                        With respect to the diesel locomotives, the application had not yet been
                        received.</p>
                    <p>In response to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>’s
                        question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> said that while a
                        formal letter on the U.S. intentions could be undertaken, this would be
                        quite time-consuming, involving a formal commitment of future fiscal year
                        funds. He believed the present expressions were sufficient. The program
                        outlined by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> had been
                        endorsed by the Secretary and by Mr. Lingle in the absence of the

                        work on the details of the Supporting Assistance loan be undertaken as soon
                        as possible in order to have it ready after the Fund arrangements would be

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> also confirmed to Dr.

                        480 arrangement and to provide an additional 400,000 tons of wheat, subject

                        arrangement. It was noted that this would make available from this time
                        approximately 600,000 tons of wheat which should provide ample time for

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> reported that he had

                        development consortium and had received a most sympathetic and courteous
                        response. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Black</persName> had agreed to
                        send a committee of experts, as soon as they were free of certain other

                        consider what projects might be financed by the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> had hoped the results of an

                            resolution as being that everything depended upon Israeli willingness to

                        permitted one talk with him (at which Ammoun and <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> were present). Prime Minister meeting alone with Johnson
                        and <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> was heavily lawyer-like and
                        even less willing to examine possibilities for progress than Foreign
                        Minister. While appearing to understand what Johnson meant when he spoke of
                        Israel concern about Arab hostility, both men insisted paragraph 11<note n="3" xml:id="d258fn3">Reference is to paragraph 11 of <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> General Assembly Resolution 194.</note>
                        is unconditional and Israeli argument therefore irrelevant.</p>
                    <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0707"/>
                    <p>In opening remarks Johnson had good opportunity to make clear his
                        understanding and appreciation of the special problem of Lebanon and his
                        awareness of the need to take account thereof in any practical scheme that
                        might be developed.</p>
                    <p>Johnson unable to get across to his full satisfaction outline of ideas
                        embodied in his Working Paper Five though he did seem to convey notion of
                        beginning with small number (about 20,000). Perhaps most encouraging note
                        was that <persName corresp="#p_TP2">Takla</persName> remarked at one point
                        that if 5,000 of such an initial 20,000 wished to return they must be
                        entitled to do so.</p>
                    <p>Both Prime Minister and Foreign Minister rejected any idea of refugee
                        commitment to “live in peace with their neighbors” prior to return, saying
                        refugee conduct would depend after return on Israel treatment of Arabs in
                        country.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TP2">Takla</persName> stressed Lebanon’s peaceful
                        intent and did not appear to assume Israel must be destroyed but Prime
                        Minister used arguments which would appear logically to lead to such a
                        result, such as “95% of the land belongs to the Arabs”.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> called me for lunch upon his
                        return from Israel, apparently to talk about a number of problems concerning
                        his government. He clearly felt unhappy about recent developments on Lake
                        Tiberias and about the signs of a shift in US policy toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, especially as revealed during the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> visit (he was of course
                        quite well-informed).</p>
                    <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0708"/>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName>’s main purpose seemed to be to
                        float the idea that the Israelis could live with US economic support of
                        Syria and even the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> so long as they were
                        adequately reassured with respect to US guarantees to them. In his opinion,
                        the Israelis were tired of being told repeatedly by the US that Israel “was
                        here to stay”; they needed some more tangible reassurance. For example, the
                        President might write a secret letter to <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben
                            Gurion</persName> along the following lines: (1) the US recognized
                        Israel’s security preoccupations; (2) Israel should be reassured that in
                        event of clear-cut Arab aggression the US would take whatever steps were
                        necessary to make sure that the attack could not succeed; (3) along with
                        such reassurances the US could also ask that Israel pursue a policy of
                        greater restraint with respect to incidents on its frontiers and cooperate
                        more effectively with <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>, etc. so that
                        ambiguous incidents would not arise. <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName>’s point was that if Israel had more in the way of a
                        security commitment from the US, it would not have to pursue such an
                        activist policy. He further indicated that while such an idea was a personal
                        one of his and indeed “contrary to his brief”, he thought his government
                        would be rather forthcoming in such circumstances.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> implied that the Israelis had
                        some indication that reassurances in some form for Israel were in the wind.
                        But one big difficulty was that the US tended to issue such reassurances
                        without any prior consultation with the Israelis. He felt that such
                        consultations could take place in full secrecy, and that it would be much
                        more profitable if they had a chance to discuss the matter with us. He
                        complained bitterly about the way in which the US patronizingly makes such
                        moves without any form of prior consultation.</p>
                    <p>Without discussing the merits of the issue, I pointed out that in any case
                        involving two adverse parties, to have a prior consultation with one party
                        made us their hostages if they should choose to use these to their own
                        political advantage. He argued that there had been several communications
                        between the US and Israel at Presidential level which had never been
                        revealed by the Israelis; we could rely upon their keeping confidence.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> indicated considerable knowledge
                        of what was discussed with <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>
                        (I neither confirmed nor denied) and presumed that the next step after
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 and the stabilization program (he
                        believed the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would accept <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> terms) would be a consortium. He questioned
                        whether substantial development aid to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would buy us much with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>; he felt that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s political behavior remained as basically hostile as
                        ever. He regarded the recent dispute in the Lake Tiberias area as having
                        been provoked by Cairo Radio’s constant pressure on Syria for not defending
                        Arab interests against the Israelis, saying that Syria and Jordan were
                        merely looking for a compromise under the infamous
                            <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan for water take-off.</p>
                    <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0709"/>
                    <p>We briefly discussed the Shah’s visit. He had heard from a middle level
                        source in the Iranian Embassy that the Shah thought the visit had gone
                        rather well, and had been pleased with the military hardware offered.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> and I had spent the first half of
                        luncheon discussing the events in Algeria and Morocco, including <persName corresp="#p_BBA1">Ben Bella</persName>’s remarks and their later
                        retraction by the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>. He seemed to endorse
                        our policy on arms for Morocco and perhaps Algeria in competition with the
                        Soviets; we agreed that the French should shoulder the main burden here, and
                        might be more forthcoming in the light of the Algerian settlement. However,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> then posed the question of
                        whether we would give arms to Syria on a similar basis of attempting to
                        preclude Soviet aid or whether we would prefer to have our European allies
                        do so. I told him that I knew of no plans for US arms sales to the Syrians
                        and that these seemed to be in quite a different category from those to
                        Morocco or potentially Algeria. I opined that if the French continued on the
                        line of developing cordial relationships with the new Algerian regime, its
                        ties with Moscow and Cairo might not develop too far.</p>

                        to leave soon for India as Ambassador but had participated in drafting in
                        Cairo of Arab League Resolution on Johnson’s Mission later adopted in
                        Riyadh. Daoudi evidently still regarded as expert on refugee question but
                        extent of his involvement in policy consideration of Johnson’s suggestions
                        somewhat doubtful. That evening Johnson and <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> had long informal talk with Daoudi at hotel at latter’s
                        suggestion. Johnson and <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> paid
                        courtesy call on Prime Minister 24th and then met about one and half hours
                        with Oustouani, Foreign Minister having clearly indicated previous day he
                        did not wish participation in further session.</p>
                    <p>There appeared, somewhat surprisingly, to be better communication with

                        through English-Arabic interpreter. Syrians had evidently made decision to
                        receive Johnson with full courtesy and state their position frankly, but
                        they apparently did not wish to be drawn into detailed discussion,
                        presumably because they are a new government and feeling their way in both
                        internal and external policy.</p>
                    <p>Johnson had fairly good opportunity to outline to Foreign Minister his ideas

                        and to elaborate them quite extensively with Oustouani and Daoudi. Main
                        points from Syrian side were: (A) Insistence that only parties involved in
                        implementation of paragraph 11 are Israel and the refugees; (B) Firm
                        adherence to Riyadh Resolution with stress on point that Israel must accept
                        repatriation in principle as envisaged paragraph 11; (C) Clear indication
                        that for them, at least, this requirement from Israel is in large part
                        though not solely for internal political reasons, since agreement to any
                        scheme not embodying this would lay them open to charges by refugees and
                        other malcontents in Syria that they were agreeing to thinly disguised
                        compensation and resettlement only; this evidently basis for statement by
                        Oustouani that Syria very desirous to see refugee problem solved; (D) Clear
                        indication that idea of starting with an initial number of 20,000 would
                        probably not be favorably received as it might be misinterpreted by refugees
                        as whittling away their rights; Daoudi thought, however, that by starting
                        with a scheme applicable in principle to all refugees, it might in fact be
                        possible to begin operation with small annual quotas, justified on
                        administrative grounds; (E) Frequent statement that Syria would cooperate
                        fully in a reasonable scheme to ascertain refugees’ real wishes without
                        pressure; and (F) Clear indication that Syria would be foolish to attack
                        Israel.”</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The present conjunction of several considerations, both foreign and domestic,
                        suggest the desirability of assuring Israel that the U.S. concedes Israel’s
                        jurisdiction over Lake Tiberias and concurs in its right to take an
                        equitable portion of the Jordan River Valley waters, using the lake as the
                        point of diversion. United States assurances would be given in exchange for
                        certain Israel commitments which are necessary to protect possible future
                        water development programs of the Arabs. Shortly before his departure for
                        Europe, the Secretary had an opportunity to explain the problem to the
                            President.<note n="1" xml:id="d261fn1">No record of the conversation has

                            Lake Tiberias: “The Ambassador said that he thought it would be a great
                            mistake to send the proposed Lake Tiberias note to the Israeli
                            Government. While he felt that we would come out on the Israeli side on
                            the question, he argued that the present draft would throw away valuable
                            bargaining power, and that we should stipulate certain conditions before
                            we accept the Israeli position. Action: the President asked that the
                            Ambassador get together with <persName>Mike Feldman</persName> and see
                            whether they could agree on anything. <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> subsequently agreed that it would be a mistake
                            to send any note at this time. When the Israeli representative to the

                    <p>Considerations which have influenced the development of the proposed course
                        of action include the following: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>We believe Israel to be entitled to a fair share of the waters of
                                the Jordan Valley and would not wish to permit obstruction of her
                                plan to use the water.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>We consider that the hostilities on and around Lake Tiberias in
                                March between Israel and Syria were directly related to Israel’s
                                plan to divert large quantities of water from the lake commencing in
                                1963. Israel is determined to carry through its plan, and the Arabs
                                desire to prevent its implementation because of the increased
                                capability Israel will <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0712"/>achieve to settle immigrants in the Negev. It is likely that the
                                Syrians in particular will continue to challenge by various means
                                Israel’s diversion plan. Having once used the retaliatory raid
                                (March 16–17) to deter Syria from hostile actions in any form,
                                Israel is likely to do so again if Syria perpetrates new hostile
                                acts. The fact that Syria defeated the Israel retaliatory raid is
                                likely to lead Israel to use force on a much larger scale the next
                                time, unless in the meantime Israel has received assurances that we
                                will defend her right to divert the waters.</item>

                                resolution of April 9, censuring Israel,<note n="3" xml:id="d261fn3"><gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> doc. S/5111.</note> was
                                to find means of strengthening the effectiveness of the United
                                Nations Truce Supervision Organization (<gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>) and of reactivating the Israel-Syria Mixed
                                Armistice Commission (<gloss target="#t_ISMAC1">ISMAC</gloss>). We
                                desire to support <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> efforts in
                                this direction. However, we believe that Israel will make no
                                meaningful concessions while there is doubt as to her right to the
                                waters of the lake. Thus, our assurances become necessary to
                                achievement of a positive result from the censure of Israel on April
                                9.</item>

                            <item>As a result of the resolution of April 9, there is a certain
                                bitterness in Israel which is reflected even more strongly in
                                American sympathizers with Israel. We do not believe that the
                                assurances we propose to give Israel will remove all unhappiness
                                either in Israel or among its sympathizers here, but we do propose
                                to try to employ the fact of our assurances to gain domestic Zionist
                                support of <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> efforts to strengthen
                                its peace-keeping machinery in the area. A complication here is our
                                increased economic assistance to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and our plans for the future. This is bound to
                                result in additional pressures on the U.S. Government to meet
                                Israel’s needs. We believe it sound not to delay the assurances,
                                subject of course to certain essential conditions.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>We had hoped that Jordan would be able to make more progress than
                                it has toward construction of a dam on the Yarmuk River under <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> aegis. It now appears that our
                                efforts in this direction will be insufficient to dampen Arab
                                hostility to the Israel diversion plan. Hence, we believe we should
                                waste no time in supporting Israel in marshaling international
                                agreement to Israel’s right to the water since the case eventually
                                must be expected to come to the Security Council. If the weight of
                                the world commonly appears to be on the side of Israel, the Arabs
                                will find more difficulty in creating serious trouble over the
                                issue.</item>

                    <p>The Department proposes to deliver a note to the Israelis containing two
                        assurances: (a) that we support their intention to divert a portion of the
                        Jordan Valley water and are prepared to make our support clear to other
                        governments, including the concerned Arab states; and (b) that Israel <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0713"/>has jurisdiction over Lake
                        Tiberias. The note in return would ask the Israelis to announce an intention
                        to divert no more of the water than allocated to them by the Unified
                            (<persName>Johnston</persName>) Plan, which was accepted at the
                        technical level by the several riparians but failed of political agreement,
                        and to agree to establishment of effective, impartial supervision of the use
                        of the water, which also is an element of the Unified Plan.</p>
                    <p>The Department would anticipate a number of benefits to flow from this
                        exchange of reciprocal assurances: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>We would expect no difficulty in obtaining the support of major
                                Western governments for such a position.</p>
                            <p>Conveyed, on the one hand, to the Israelis, that Government should be
                                encouraged to act with both confidence and restraint as the critical
                                date approaches. On the other hand, the Arabs would be left in no
                                doubt as to the absence of Western support for any further
                                recalcitrance on their part, but at the same time would have
                                assurances that ultimate development of their share of the water was
                                protected.</p>
                            <p>The Israelis would no longer have legitimate reasons, based in
                                security requirements, for denying to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> instrumentalities the additional facilities and
                                prerogatives they require to improve their ability to arrest the
                                threat of violence in incipient stages.</p>
                            <p>The Administration’s position vis-à-vis United States friends of
                                Israel would be greatly improved. Not only could the Administration
                                demonstrate a positive posture on the water controversy but could
                                argue persuasively that Israel’s friends would have every reason to
                                support the Administration’s efforts in the interests of both
                                governments and to foster peace and stability in the Near East.</p>

                    <p>It was deemed necessary to obtain the concurrence of the White House to the
                        foregoing. A note was drafted which it was proposed the Secretary would hand
                        to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> before the
                        latter’s current trip. However, protracted negotiations with the White House
                        ensued and remain uncompleted, although differences have narrowed to the
                        question of a U.S. definition of its official position towards Israel’s
                        claim to Lake Tiberias. Three alternatives to our original proposal have

                    <p>Opposition to Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim of Iraq has had as its
                        consistent objective his violent overthrow but has been frustrated by fear
                        of his wide powers over all aspects of government, by his ubiquitous and
                        overlapping intelligence networks and by his control of the Army.
                        Nevertheless, as a leader Qasim is now disliked, hated and privately
                        ridiculed by almost all sections of the Iraqi public, including apparently,
                        growing segments of the Army.</p>
                    <p>Qasim is currently engaged in a military action, using troops, artillery and
                        planes against Kurdish tribal insurgents (supported by the leftist
                        Democratic Party of Kurdistan and by city Kurds) in the north and northeast
                        of Iraq along the Turkish and Iranian borders.<note n="1" xml:id="d262fn1">Documentation relating to Kurdish insurgents in Iraq is in Department
                            of State, Central File 787.001.</note> This military campaign is
                        politically damaging since Qasim has insisted that Iraq is a
                            “brother<persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName>” of Arabs, Kurds and
                        other minorities, and Kurdish resistance highlights Qasim’s estrangement
                        from all Iraqis. Kurdish guerilla fighters are famously tough and elusive
                        and the heavy strain on the Army has created discontent in the Iraqi
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>There has never been a period since Qasim’s overthrow of the Hashemite
                        Monarchy on July 14, 1958 that his own overthrow has not been plotted by
                        dissident elements. An uprising was mounted against him by an Army officer
                        in Mosul during March 1959 and in October of <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0715"/>the same year he was shot by Ba’athist gunmen. There are
                        current reports that a new Ba’athist attempt to overthrow him is being
                        planned for April or May (see attached Intelligence Note).<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">Not attached; identified as Intelligence Note of April
                            12, 1962.</note></p>
                    <p>A successor regime to Qasim would probably fall somewhere in the Arab
                        nationalist, neutralist, political spectrum. A successor government would
                        probably be somewhat less anti-Western in its complexion and policy.
                        However, it has been firm U.S. policy to avoid involvement in any way with
                        opposition to Qasim, even with Iraqis who profess basic friendliness to the
                        U.S.</p>
                    <p>While pressures on Qasim and the threat to his regime seem greater than at
                        any time over the last two and half years, we do not underestimate his
                        ability, demonstrated so often in the past, to extricate himself and somehow
                        preserve his position. However, we note below some thoughts as to our
                        possible courses of action in a period subsequent to Qasim’s disappearance
                        from the scene. In each case the U.S. should consult closely with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> and also undertake discussions with Turkey
                        and Iran.</p>

                        <item>If the group assuming power is judged as representing Iraqis generally
                            described as nationalist and appears to be in firm control, the U.S.
                            should consider prompt recognition and should be prepared to respond
                            promptly and favorably to overtures for assistance. We should discourage
                            interference by any of Iraq’s neighbors if such interference is
                            contemplated.</item>

                        <item>Should the group assuming power after an overthrow of Qasim be
                            recognized as representing the Ba’ath Party (the Arab Socialist
                            Renaissance Party, an organization often rent by serious factional
                            disputes), the U.S. would wish to delay recognition long enough to be
                            satisfied there is no (or little) question that the group is actually in
                            full control. In this situation also we should discourage interference
                            by Iraq’s neighbors.</item>

                            the U.S. should recognize the new government on the basis of the same
                            criteria it would use were there no Kurdish complications involved, thus
                            avoiding any appearance of support for Kurdish claims.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>In the event of a protracted period of conflict involving struggle
                            between Communist and non-Communist elements, we should consider in
                            consultation with Iraq’s neighbors and with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, how non-Communist elements could be assisted to
                            prevail without open <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0716"/>intervention by the U.S. or by any other Western power including
                            Turkey and Iran. It would be desirable for a struggle to remain Arabized
                            insofar as possible. Accordingly, it might be necessary to give covert
                            support for anti-Communist elements in Iraq. It would be preferable that
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss> know of and acquiesce in any
                            such action.</item>

                        <item>Similarly, in the less-likely case of a successful sudden seizure of
                            power by Communist elements in Iraq, we should consider how best to
                            channel or encourage what would in all probability be a reaction of deep
                            alarm by Iraq’s neighbors. We should be prepared to bring the issue
                            before the United Nations Security Council as required, with a view to
                            deterring active Soviet, and possibly other, intervention in whatever
                            internal conflict might ensue in reaction to the Communist
                            takeover.</item>

                        to see progress on refugee question but there are signs of growing
                        impatience with Arab-Israel disputes and with prospect of supporting
                        refugees indefinitely in absence of any evidence of Arab or Israeli
                        willingness to change status quo; (3) set forth his ideas along the line of
                        his Working Paper Five; and (4) emphasized his willingness to consider any
                        suggestions <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> might give him for moving
                        forward, and his hope that he might receive such suggestions, expressing his

                    <p>He received clear indications that first reaction to the idea of beginning

                                told him beforehand of their ideas, saying they did not wish to go
                                behind the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s back but adding
                                that they wished to create a means for speaking for themselves and
                                thus to attempt to remove themselves from the “cold war” (Helmi’s
                                words) among the Arab states. Helmi said he had told them he was not
                                prepared to express <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> views,
                                pending clarification of their program and intentions.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Helmi, who throughout emphasized that he was speaking personally and not
                        officially, appeared to believe this might constitute a factor of new
                        significance although he clearly had reservations about effectiveness of
                        individuals involved. Johnson took opportunity not only to say that this
                        movement might have an adverse impact on his activities but to argue that
                        suggested parallel with Algeria was false and dangerous for Palestinians
                        themselves.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mac</hi>: Several of our friends have been rather
                        concerned about the possible domestic political difficulties which may
                        result in any change of our attitude toward the United Arab Republic.</p>
                    <p>In this regard, I think you may be interested in the enclosed speech which I
                        gave recently to the American Jewish Congress.<note n="1" xml:id="d264fn1">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, May
                            7, 1962, pp. 765–769.</note></p>
                    <p>As you will see, the speech strongly implies an approach to the Middle East
                        which would encourage internal development in the hope that if individuals
                        such as <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> become involved in
                        their internal affairs, there will be less time and energy to carry on the
                        conflict which has plagued this area for so many years.</p>
                    <p>At dinner I met with various members of the board of directors of the
                        American Jewish Congress and opened up this question with great frankness.
                        The views which I expressed seemed to be very much accepted.</p>
                    <p>I hope you will agree that this is reassuring evidence that while there may
                        be criticism from some individuals that with careful handling and frank
                        explanation our domestic political problem should not present any
                        unmanageable difficulties.</p>
                    <p>In this regard, I believe it would be most helpful if we could extend an
                        invitation to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in the next few
                        weeks to visit the United States sometime after the election in
                        November.</p>
                    <p>Although the situation will always be unpredictable, I think this kind of
                        approach will go a long way to focus his interest on his own internal
                        development questions, with less time left for the Voice of the Arabs
                        radio.</p>
                    <p>With my warmest regards,</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        between the Shah of Iran and the Secretary of Defense on April 12,<note n="1" xml:id="d265fn1"><ref target="#d244">Document 244</ref>.</note>
                        and the Aide-Mémoire covering that conversation presented to the Shah on
                        April 13,<note n="2" xml:id="d265fn2"><ref target="#d248">Document
                            248</ref>.</note> you are aware of the nature of the new five-year U.S.
                        Plan for military assistance to smaller Iranian armed forces. Minor
                        modifications, such as the early provision of C–47 aircraft, were made prior
                        to the Shah’s departure from the United States.</p>
                    <p>In receiving the Aide-Mémoire, the Shah did not state specifically that he
                        approved of the entire U.S. approach, and there were later indications that
                        the Shah was slightly piqued because he had not participated in the
                        formulation of the U.S. concept.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>, however, had
                        several long conversations with the Shah in New York, and is convinced that
                        the Shah is in essential agreement with the Plan, and will accept it.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> feels that the Shah
                        will delay in conveying a full acceptance until he utilizes the presence of
                        a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> planning team in Iran to make a final
                        effort to persuade U.S. military authorities of the usefulness of certain
                        additional items of equipment. State and Defense have agreed that for all
                        practical purposes the Shah is reconciled to the general provisions of the
                        U.S. Plan; he is welcoming the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> team to
                        Iran, and the presence of the team is an essential element of the Plan. We
                        also appreciate that the Iranian military will continue to press for
                        additional items not included in the Aide-Mémoire and will argue in favor of
                        retaining substantial forces above the 150,000, as a static force for the
                        northern borders. The success <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0720"/>of
                        the planning team and follow-up action on the part of the Shah is,
                        therefore, an important consideration to reviewing the U.S. Plan after the
                        planning team submits its report.</p>

                        will arise.</p>
                    <p>You might additionally express pleasure at more full and frank expressions of

                        proof that by such dialogue mutual problems generally become more

                    <p>In conclusion you may wish stress need to guard against over-optimism as
                        regards rapidity with which progress can be achieved. Many of problems we
                        face in both political and economic fields are highly complex and unwieldy
                        of solution.</p>
                    <p>Re US attitude toward current developments in Syria see no reason you raise
                        matter. However, should it come up in course discussion you might say we
                        have, of course, scrupulously avoided any efforts influence recent internal
                        developments in Syria and rumors re our activities there totally baseless.

                        and again on Saturday 5 May and then had long session with the Prime

                        public figures including prominent refugees were present, also several Arab
                        Ambassadors.</p>
                    <p>After Johnson made his usual opening statement <persName corresp="#p_NHH3">Nuseibeh</persName> began by formally reading text of Riyadh

                        described as his duty. Subsequent discussions variously described as
                        “private”, “off the record”, “unofficial”, etc. were very frank and
                        free-flowing ranging over the whole Palestine question, although both
                        Ministers acknowledged that Johnson’s mission limited to paragraph 11 of
                        General Assembly Resolution 194 (III) and that Arabs had repeatedly insisted
                        this point. At one point <persName corresp="#p_NHH3">Nuseibeh</persName>
                        justified this departure from the Arab position for the record by referring
                        to the last paragraph of the Riyadh Resolution which in substance states
                        that question of refugees cannot be disassociated from Palestine question as
                        whole and from relevant <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions.

                                liquidation of Palestine question as a whole, to Arab

                    <p>When Johnson expressed his surprise in view of the Arabs initiative on
                        paragraph 11 and their reiterated insistence that he limit himself to it,
                        both Ministers were frankly critical of Arab for proposing this approach and
                        openly puzzled as to reasons for it. (Same attitude was expressed by many at
                        the dinner.) Johnson pointed out possible effect of inconsistency in world
                        opinion and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly action. The
                        point got across.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that both men feel that any stirrings in the Arab world are signs
                        that 1962 may well be a “turning point” year that calls for a serious new
                        look at Palestine question by Arabs. They urged that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the great powers, etc., also take new look. They do not
                        however have yet in mind any concrete proposals or plan. They are searching
                        for ways to overcome present weakness vis-à-vis Israel and in words of King
                        “correct the imbalance”. All are aware of difficulties, particularly in
                        light of frankly acknowledged conflict among Arab states. Only thing
                        specific is that they reject Palestine entity concept or a liberation
                        government on Algerian model.</p>
                    <p>When Johnson asked <persName corresp="#p_NHH3">Nuseibeh</persName> what he
                        felt refugees would choose if given the chance, Foreign Minister expressed
                        conviction that most would elect to return. The Prime Minister however, when
                        asked same question in <persName corresp="#p_NHH3">Nuseibeh</persName>’s
                        presence, was doubtful that many would so choose.</p>

                            325.84/5–1062)</note> Johnson reports talk was much more “free flowing”
                        than earlier talks here. Johnson got into more detail than previously re his
                        thoughts of practical approach. <persName corresp="#p_TP2">Takla</persName>
                        said there are “stirrings” in Arab world re Palestine question which must be
                        taken <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0724"/>into account. He like leaders
                        elsewhere indicated one of main problems is intra-Arab feuding. He said
                        Lebanon could not take any lead but would go along with anything acceptable
                        to other Arab countries. Johnson will supply more detailed report later.</p>
                    <p>Following lunch with me, Johnson returned to Jerusalem for day of rest prior
                        to his next encounter with Israelis.</p>
                    <p>In general Johnson described his talks throughout Arab world as “gloomy” but
                        no doors had been closed. In addition to inter-Arab feuding, his efforts
                        complicated by extremist moves by Shuqairi and others for some sort of
                        Palestine organization. Consoling feature was that while Palestine-minded
                        Arabs are “stirring” there complete lack of unanimity among extremists re
                        what should be done.</p>
                    <p>Johnson expects rough going in Israel. He said he would after European
                        interlude return to US and hoped have thorough talks with Department
                        officials with view to mobilizing USG from top-level down for whatever
                        course he would carefully lay out.</p>
                    <p>For my part, I expressed to Johnson following personal observations: a) While
                        I had had doubts re wisdom his making trip, it clear that this round has
                        been extremely useful in exposing to parties concerned current trend of his
                        thinking; B) No Arab leader can be expected to say yes to anything that any
                        rival might publicly denounce as softness toward Israel; C) Johnson’s
                        excellent rapport with Arab leaders obviously continues and is a great
                        asset; D) No doors were closed; E) Implication is that Arab leaders will not
                        be surprised and might even welcome Johnson’s tabling his proposals but
                        without their having to register public approval; F) Only few years ago
                        visit to Arab capitals by any representative in search of refugee solution
                        would have produced great uproar, street demonstrations, et cetera, but
                        Johnson quite reasonably received and in Arab world where matters must be
                        gauged in degrees of negative this is real progress; G) While any initiative
                        with respect to Palestine has gloomy prospect, approach re refugees which
                        Johnson has in mind is clearly most practical one; H) Time seems fast
                        approaching when (if metaphors may be mixed) Johnson might wish take bit by
                        teeth, work out best possible detailed formula, take plunge with <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName>’s backing and let chips fall where
                        they may; I) At worst what would probably ensue is resistance on part of
                        both sides with his being able report to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        failure of his mission and plague on both their houses thus putting both
                        sides in bad light in future <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debates; J)
                        Off-chance exists that in effort to avert onus for failure both sides will
                        be willing to “back into” acquiescence to his formula with at least some
                        movement on this problem as result.</p>
                    <p>Johnson agreed his visit useful particularly along lines compelling Arabs to
                        do some realistic thinking.</p>

                            by <persName>Johnston</persName> Plan, just as we support Arab right
                            withdraw water within same limitations. Israelis have already been told
                            so by me and by others. Question is how and when make known our support
                            publicly without aggravating tensions in area, without injecting US

                        <item>As I see it, there are two separate aspects to problem—domestic and
                            foreign. At home we can and should let Jewish community know through
                            selective briefings that US supports Israel’s use of waters and will at
                            appropriate point make known our support publicly. Foreign policy
                            aspects more complex. Fortunately, we have enough time, since Israelis
                            will not withdraw water for at least 18 months. However, we have much to
                            do to prepare Arab govts and peoples accept eventual US support. This
                            must be presented as part of constructive plan for Middle East as a
                            whole and not merely as US response to Israeli pressure. Meanwhile we
                            must avoid premature moves.</item>

                            invited in the near future for a visit in December.</note> We both think
                        invite would be premature. Aside from exacerbating already sensitive
                        domestic Jewish feelings, it wouldn’t gain us much at this stage.</p>
                    <p>My pitch to JFK and <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> would be
                        that we have already given <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        enough bait, particularly as result of <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> visit, to hold him for a while. It is now time to
                        sit back, wait for some results, and then take a new reading. Immediately
                        after having given him more <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480, $20–30
                        million in stabilization credits, and promised to consider some $51 million
                        in development loans, why rush in with yet another goody in form of an
                        invite? It would be to throw away cheaply one of our hole cards, at a time
                        when <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> himself doesn’t expect
                        any more.</p>
                    <p>Instead we ought to test <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
                        responsiveness by a series of discreet probes over next few months before
                        proceeding to what most of us would regard as the culmination of a major
                        political initiative. Moreover, to keep <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> dangling a bit about a visit is an added inducement
                        to good behavior on his part. Finally, I gather that only open place on
                        calendar would be December, so why invite him now for December or later when
                        so many things could happen in the meantime to make an invitation
                        inadvisable.</p>
                    <p>I’m still strongly in favor of an invite at right moment. And we should
                        invite <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> before Tito. Not to do
                        so would be highly offensive to a jealous Arab who, whatever he may be, is
                        not a Communist. To invite Tito before <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would, I think, be deeply resented.</p>

                        development loans, should we rush in with yet another plum? <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> himself probably doesn’t expect any
                        more of us at this moment, so I question whether we should throw away so
                        quickly one of our hole cards which may come in quite handy later.</p>
                    <p>Instead it seems to me that now is the time to sit back and wait for some
                        responsive behavior on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s part
                        over the next few months, before proceeding to what most of us would regard
                        as the culmination of a major political initiative. To keep <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> dangling a bit longer about a visit
                        might be an added inducement to good behavior on his part. Moreover, with
                        Israeli feelings, and those of the American Jewish community, rather bruised
                        at this moment over the Tiberias affair, a <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> invitation now might create quite a political
                        backlash.</p>
                    <p>However, I have a completely open mind about an invitation at the right
                        moment, and I believe this is also the President’s view. All in all, I think
                        that our policy toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is
                        evolving at a pretty fast clip, but it has been mostly a US effort so far.
                        The President would probably want to see a little more of the color of
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s money before he sat down
                        to play face-to-face poker with him.</p>

Johnson and <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> met with Israeli Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> for about two and one-half hours on May
                        10, one and one-half hours on the 11th, and with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> for an hour on the twelfth.
                        Raphael, Yaari and <persName corresp="#p_AS6">Arad</persName> of the Foreign
                        Office were present during the two meetings with the Foreign Minister, and
                        the first two with the Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> also met informally with <persName corresp="#p_AS6">Arad</persName> at <persName corresp="#p_AS6">Arad</persName>’s request
                        after the second meeting with the Foreign Minister. The main points Johnson
                        gave as his impressions from his Arab talks were as follows: <list>
                            <label>(A)</label>
                            <item>He had in each meeting with the Arabs explained that his mission
                                was not only limited to paragraph 11, but circumscribed by the fact
                                that as a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> official he could not
                                recommend anything that would threaten the independence of Israel, a
                                full-fledged <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member. No Arab
                                statesman took exception to this as a proper definition by Johnson
                                of his mission.</item>

                            <item>All the Arabs had told him in various ways that war on Israel by
                                the Arabs would be folly and he believed they were sincere. On the
                                other hand they had serious fears of Israeli expansion or
                                aggression.</item>
                            <label>(C)</label>
                            <item>None of them showed any disposition to respond favorably to the
                                Israeli “feeler” that Johnson had transmitted concerning some form
                                of mutual declarations of non-aggression.</item>
                            <label>(D)</label>
                            <item>All had insisted in conformity with the Riyadh resolution that
                                Israel must accept paragraph 11 in principle and none had expressed
                                a willingness to accept Johnson’s ideas even as a basis for
                                discussion before such acceptance. Johnson told Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> he believed that this was
                                largely because for internal and inter-Arab political reasons they
                                could not afford to appear to “sell out” and that the failure to
                                accept could not yet be definitely characterized as
                                rejection.</item>
                            <label>(E)</label>
                            <item>They acknowledged when reminded that the phrase “live at peace
                                with their neighbors” had significance but they felt that it did not
                                imply a prior undertaking by refugees rather that the attitude of
                                returnees would depend on their treatment by Israel.</item>
                            <label>(F)</label>
                            <item>Despite the generally negative tone he had the feeling that there
                                was or would be if the repatriation point could be met in some
                                reasonable fashion a greater willingness in the Arab countries to
                                consider his <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0730"/>suggestions
                                for implementing paragraph 11 than in Israel. (This impression was
                                based largely on Johnson’s strong, though unexpressed, conclusion
                                that the whole tenor in Israel’s stand from last September to that
                                point had been to parade every possible argument for doing
                                nothing.)</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>At the first meeting with the Foreign Minister, Johnson made the first five
                        points above and only touched on (F). He received essentially another long
                        speech from the Foreign Minister on Israel’s security problems. At the
                        second meeting largely in order to crystallize the issues he emphasized (F).
                        This gave the Israelis a jolt and they made some effort to contend that
                        there had been a change in Johnson’s attitude or position between the two
                        meetings. The Foreign Minister specifically expressed disappointment
                        although the meeting ended on a friendly basis personally. <persName corresp="#p_AS6">Arad</persName> later told <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> in some heat that Johnson’s comparisons disadvantageous
                        to Israel might lead to a stormy session with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>. It is clear, however, that while they resent the
                        idea of comparisons, responsible Israelis want to avoid appearing publicly
                        to be an obstacle to progress, and cooler heads prevailed.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>, well briefed by Raphael,
                        received Johnson very warmly. He opened the meeting with a summary of what
                        he understood were Johnson’s main points from the previous two meetings with
                        the Foreign Minister. He asked if his summary was accurate. Johnson said it
                        was in substance though a little sharper and less shaded than what he had
                        actually said. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> then said
                        that despite the fact that Israel had no moral obligation to help solve the
                        refugee problem Israel wanted to help as this could be a step to peace and
                        accordingly he asked Johnson what specifically he wanted from Israel
                        now.</p>
                    <p>Johnson replied that at this point he was only asking Israel to agree to
                        think through seriously in cooperation with him to see if it would not be
                        possible to develop a workable scheme along the lines he had suggested. He
                        described in some detail his ideas as in his Working Paper 5, introducing
                        for the first time the idea that Israel agree to examine repatriation
                        applications “in good faith”. He emphasized his view that the scheme would
                        have to be in harmony with paragraph 11, make clear present realities to the
                        refugees and safeguard Israel. Referring as in the two meetings with the
                        Foreign Minister to the difficulties that open and formal undertakings would
                        present to the Arabs (and might present to Israel) on certain issues he
                        stressed the possible value of the concepts of acquiescence and tacit
                        acceptance.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> said he still did not
                        understand what Johnson wanted and launched into a fervent exposition of
                        Israel’s danger repeating much that had been heard in all sessions in 1961
                        and this year with the Foreign Minister and from himself last year, and
                        emphasizing that Israel must be the sole judge in these matters. Johnson
                        acknowledged the last, while reserving his right to try to persuade Israel
                        on specific points in <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0731"/>connection
                        with the development in detail of any scheme. He tried again to explain what
                        he wanted and this time <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>
                        seemed to understand better. He confirmed <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>’s earlier statement that “Israel had never said not a
                        single refugee could return”, but said there were two limitations: (A) There
                        could be no “free choice”; and (B) There could be no repatriation without
                        resettlement.</p>
                    <p>Johnson explained the difference between “free choice” and “preferences”, and
                        acknowledged (B) saying (without contradiction) that this statement—repeated
                        soon afterward—gave him hope as he assumed this was a two-way idea, namely
                        that if the Arabs agreed to do something on resettlement, Israel would on
                        repatriation. He concluded with an appeal that the same imagination and
                        creativity that Israel had shown on other problems be applied to this
                        refugee problem, not to solve it, but to dissolve it.</p>
                    <p>The meeting concluded on this note having been on a friendly plane throughout
                        with occasional moments of humor. Raphael confirmed to <persName corresp="#p_MSG2">Moe</persName> later that <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> retained his high opinion of Johnson and that the
                        formulation “dissolve” had intrigued him. The parting note with Raphael was
                        the importance of continuing to work at the problem and assurances that
                        Israel would give serious thought to this.</p>

                        in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> as well as on my brother in <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0732"/>the White House. I was myself
                        invited to a dinner in his honor last night by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> and at the insistence of the Israeli
                        Military Attaché, Colonel <persName corresp="#p_PCY1">Prihar</persName>, I
                        also accepted an invitation to breakfast this morning with <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> on his last morning before leaving. At
                        the close of this conversation, he indicated that he regarded it as a
                        serious presentation of his government’s viewpoint which he wished to have
                        considered and replied to, although apparently not to be regarded as a
                        formal matter for correspondence at the present time. The points covered in
                        the conversation were as follows: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item><p><hi rend="italic">Basic Thesis</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> urged that the U.S., if possible,
                                    undertake some marked new initiative designed to stabilize the
                                    situation in the Middle East, and above all to relieve Israel’s
                                    sense of isolation. As alternative means to this end, he
                                    suggested such possibilities as a U.S. or tripartite guarantee
                                    of the present territories of Israel (perhaps coupled with a
                                    declaration that we would join in resisting any external
                                    encroachment by Israel from these territories) or some form of
                                    association by Israel with the U.S. alone or with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, either by way of membership
                                    or some form of participation in research and development or

                                <p><persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> continued that, if
                                    such a major initiative were not possible, the U.S. should at
                                    least be prepared to take a more major role alongside France as
                                    a supplier of military equipment under sales arrangements.
                                    Specifically, he urged that, over and above existing small arms,
                                    Early Warning equipment and SONAR orders now pending, the U.S.
                                    should supply a Hawk missile unit.</p></item>

                                considerable success in expanding its relationship with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                    declassified</hi>] as well as with several countries in Africa
                                and even Latin America. While this was psychologically consoling,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and Syria remained
                                hostile. The Israeli would never trust <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and would always be afraid that he would
                                attack Israel if he achieved a sufficient preponderance of military
                                power, which he was now building up quite rapidly. Therefore,
                                Israel, feeling itself both a democracy in principle and a
                                stabilizing force in the area, believed that some recognition of
                                these facts by the U.S. was both deserved and a contribution to
                                stability and peace in the area.</item>

                                    French had been willing suppliers in the past, they were clearly
                                    going to seek to expand their influence in the Arab world once
                                    Algeria was settled. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de
                                        Murville</persName> had complained personally to him that

                                    and would feel much relieved if others could pick up a part of
                                    the burden. Meanwhile, the British apparently believed that
                                    “less and less” dealings with Israel were essential to the
                                    maintenance of their own position in the Arab world; <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>

                                    arguing that the French had maintained a better standing in the
                                    Arab world than the British notwithstanding or perhaps even
                                    because of their support for Israel, and that some Britishers
                                    were now thinking that possibly a policy of “more and more”
                                    support for Israel might be a better gambit on the Arab problem
                                    or at least provide the opportunity to meet rebuffs by
                                    unpleasant action.</p>

                                    bombers, and was now receiving <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21 fighters. In addition the Israeli had firm
                                    evidence that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> technicians
                                    were being trained in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                    in the operation of missiles; thus, he said it could only be a
                                    question of a short time before some form of missile was in the
                                    hands of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, most probably

                                <p>From this, <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> concluded
                                    that the Hawk represented a vital element in Israeli military
                                    requirements for putting up a convincing deterrent to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and/or Syrian attack. He also
                                    argued that the true test of a weapon should be its purpose, and
                                    that the Hawk was purely defensive whereas some non-missile
                                    hardware, such as a bomber, might be equally clearly
                                    offensive.</p></item>

                                    regarded the Early Warning sales transaction with us as just
                                    about wrapped up, since an Air Force team had just surveyed the
                                    site. (We had long doubted whether they were serious in this
                                    transaction, or whether they were trying to get a better line on
                                    the capacity of the equipment through the device of asking for
                                    it.) Colonel <persName corresp="#p_PCY1">Prihar</persName> also
                                    indicated that the SONAR transaction was a sure thing as far as
                                    they were concerned. Both <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PCY1">Prihar</persName> indicated that they had no other pending
                                    sales problems of any consequence, but <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> reiterated that the real
                                    key was our willingness to supply something that would be a
                                    demonstrable indication of our concern for supporting Israel and
                                    maintaining a military balance. He noticeably did not mention
                                    any bomber aircraft (which he had appeared to suggest in his
                                    conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>).</p>
                                <p>With reference to the Mirage III purchased from France, I asked

                                    and credit terms, and he replied without strain that the cost
                                    per aircraft was now $860,000 for the basic airplane, which with
                                    fire control systems and initial spares brought the total cost
                                    to about $1.2 million per unit. They have a 3-year credit from
                                    the French at 7% and an escalation clause on the price providing
                                    for a 7% annual rise to meet French labor cost increases. He
                                    indicated that the French had given them no special reduction of
                                    any sort, but that the price seemed to them fair and reasonable.
                                    However, he did indicate that it was a major financial strain on
                                    his annual budget situation. (This would suggest that they <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0734"/>might seek some form of
                                    credit terms on the Hawk if we agreed to let them buy

                    <p>At the close of our discussion, which diverged over a great many other
                        subjects as well but came back to these points both at the beginning and
                        end, <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> made clear that he was not
                        making a formal request for the Hawk at the present time since to do so
                        might court a formal refusal. However, he clearly wished his ideas to be
                        conveyed to the State Department and others, and expected that we would find
                        some way of indicating whether we were receptive to any part of it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>. From the military standpoint, <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> believes that the Israeli Air Force remains
                        qualitatively superior to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and would
                        probably win an air battle, “if an effective defense of Israel’s air
                        facilities could be maintained.” The Israeli are particularly short of
                        all-weather fighters. Thus, while one can read into their present insistence
                        all sorts of collateral political motives (such as a desire for a gesture of
                        support from us at a time when they are bulling through the Jordan River
                        development project), there is nonetheless a valid military basis for their
                        concern and for their selection of the Hawk as an item of key importance in
                        their military posture.</p>
                    <p>As to the question of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> acquiring
                        missiles, we have no clear-cut intelligence when the Soviets will deliver
                        but there have been reports pertaining to site preparation in the

                    <p>954. I called on Prime Minister <hi rend="italic">Amini</hi> today after his
                        return from his pilgrimage to Mecca. He began the conversation by stressing
                        the alarm and concern he had encountered on the part of King Saud, Prince
                        Faisal, and other Saudi officials and civilians, as well as the Jordanian
                        Chargé, <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0735"/>with regard to the US
                        policy toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He found great
                        bitterness toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in Jidda, and the
                        conviction that if the US were not supporting <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> he would collapse. The Saudis and the Jordanian
                        Chargé found it impossible to understand why the US, which purported to be
                        their friend, was helping the man who was seeking to destroy their
                        governments. These officials did not share what they understood to be the US
                        view that at least <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was not a
                        Communist and that if he were to disappear there might be the danger of a
                        Communist or extreme leftist regime in Egypt. They felt that in the event of
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s collapse some other
                        group, not Communist, would take over.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> said that he had endeavored to
                        allay these fears and to persuade Saudi officials that just because the US
                        was helping <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was no reason to
                        believe it had any less regard for its friendship with Saudi Arabia. He
                        pointed out that the question of the course and policy of the Egyptian
                        Government had long been a complicated one and that although Iran had no
                        cause to love <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, it could
                        understand how broader considerations might make it desirable for the US to
                        help him.</p>
                    <p>I said that I believed our policy toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was based on the estimate that this was a time of crisis in
                        Egypt, that it might well be a unique opportunity for the West to gain a
                        position of greater influence in Cairo, and that it would be better for the
                        neighboring states if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> were to devote
                        its energies to the domestic field. I said that we did not see how the Near
                        East as a whole would benefit if there should be collapse and chaos in
                        Egypt, possibly preceded by foreign adventures, and said that as far as I
                        knew we felt far from certain that a regime which might take <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s place would be a more constructive
                        one from our point of view. After reviewing the long standing quarrel
                        between Saud and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, in which

                        greater presence in Iraq through its aid facilities, and he thoroughly
                        agreed. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> reiterated that he
                        knew that the question of aid to Egypt involved broad policy considerations
                        but urged that we make a greater effort to persuade the Saudi Arabians and
                        the Jordanians of the validity of these. He said he sensed a strong
                        anti-American current in the Arabian Peninsula and also the feeling that the
                        US might be gradually abandoning its interest in Saudi Arabia. He felt that
                        the insecurity which was so apparent in the top officialdom there resulted
                        more from the decadence of the ruling group and the enormous gap between
                        rich and poor than it did from any immediate threat from Cairo.</p>

                        going into details he told Department officials Israel hopes for US
                        assistance in meeting financial burden of increased armament;
                        reconsideration USG’s refusal to sell Hawk missiles; and accelerated
                        consideration Israel’s requests to purchase conventional military equipment.
                        He made same points to <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> officers and in
                        addition suggested closer US identification with Israel military.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> based his case on growing
                        military strength <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and alleged conviction
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is committed to strike at
                        Israel when he has achieved sufficient arms superiority. He referred to
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s access to <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21s and Soviet naval vessels or equipment as evidence

                        strides towards military superiority goal. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> said that expanded US assistance to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> increases Israel’s security problem in that

                        critical domestic economic problems. Inasmuch as Israel thus directly
                        affected, he argued, US should make compensatory gesture on Israel’s
                        behalf.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> expressed
                        understanding Israel’s apprehensions arising from its exposed position but
                        commented US has great respect for Israel’s military competence and
                        estimates it as being match for some time to come for any Arab combination.
                        He remarked US has no evidence beyond propaganda statements that Arabs
                        contemplating military move against Israel. He also pointed out that any
                        drastic increase in Israeli armament, particularly to more sophisticated
                        weapons, would likely result in corresponding increase in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> possibly leading to uncontrolled escalation
                        which might add to rather than decrease instability in region.</p>
                    <p>USG representatives made no commitment to <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>, although he was informed USG willing to study

                        as valuable instrument Israel policy. Such raids, he said, employed when
                        Israel is convinced local incidents such as recent Lake Tiberias conflict
                        have central government instigation. He cited relative calm since raid as
                        proof this policy’s efficacy and disagreed with <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>’s remark that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        agencies’ efforts were principal factor. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>
                        both questioned not only propriety but efficacy of retaliatory raid policy,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> observing that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> decision to embark on major increase in

                        together with other manifestations of our willingness to be of further
                        assistance, set the stage for the visit of Minister of Economy <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>. In one sense Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>’s mission was the culmination of
                        an extended process wherein both the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and

                        against Iran and the Shah.<note n="1" xml:id="d276fn1">Documentation is in

                        attacking Iran if Iran will reciprocate, it is noteworthy that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> propaganda did not let up against Iran
                        before or during the <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> visit,
                        a period which in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> eyes must have marked

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is satisfied with the results of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> visit. That there is
                        much to be done to straighten things out with several European countries is
                        well understood by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. That the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> may be able to take certain unpalatable
                        actions in this connection is a reasonable conclusion in light of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> commitment to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> to devalue the currency and restrict internal credit. We
                        have demonstrated that our intentions are not only honorable but generous.
                        We have set an example for the European nations. In time the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will be able to meet its short-term foreign
                        currency requirements. In its relations with Moscow the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will have a new bargaining point: increased
                        US aid. Having before it a pledge of more development loans and the prospect
                        of a development consortium, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is
                        encouraged to continue the course it has chosen to adopt: closer association
                        with the Free World while continuing to maintain good relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, relative moderation on the

                        greater portion of its trade toward the West, a more genuine neutralism, and
                        improvement of its relations with [illegible—Israel?].</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">5. The Next Phase.</hi></p>
                    <p>The stage we are now entering in our relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> may appropriately be called the
                        “pre-development consortium phase”. We would expect it to endure some 9–12
                        months, or perhaps somewhat longer. We propose to continue our step-by-step
                        approach, carefully laying the groundwork for each move, making clear what
                        obligations the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> must meet and what the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> may expect from the US, and
                        requiring adequate performance by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>For the next several months the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will be
                        occupied in making a success of its stabilization program; attracting
                        additional European support for it; negotiating a multi-year PL–480
                        agreement with the US; settling its financial accounts with numerous other
                        countries arising out of Egyptianization, nationalization and sequestration;
                        trying to make its new political system and nationalized enterprises work;
                        establishing a relationship with <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> while
                        trying to create among neutral countries techniques for dealing with the
                        challenge of the Common Market; and seeking expanded markets in the West for
                        cotton and cotton textiles. During this period the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will continue to communicate with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> with a view to establishment of a team of
                        experts to conduct a pre-consortium examination of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> economy and economic development plans. In
                        all this we propose to let events take their natural course except for

                    <p>We propose, however, to conduct a number of conversations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> other ranking officials. We also
                        have in mind for the late summer a letter from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The conversations would be conducted by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>. We have already
                        instructed him to follow up with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> after Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> has made his report, to assure that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> fully understands not only our
                        commitments but the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> obligations arising
                        out of <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>’s negotiations with
                        us, and with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. We plan to follow this with a series of
                        approaches designed as a follow-up to Ambassador <hi rend="italic">Bowles</hi>’ talks, dealing with global issues, the position of
                        neutrals, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> domestic scene, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations with the Europeans, and area
                        problems including Jordan waters. Regarding the latter we shall gently
                        remind <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> of his commitment to
                        keep Israel “in the icebox” and urge <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        moderation on the waters issue in the interest of area stability. Also we
                        shall continue to recommend abatement of radio warfare, a reduction in
                        statism in the economic field, broadening of the political base of the
                        regime, rural development, and negotiation of an investment guarantee
                        program for certain fields such as tourism in which the investment of
                        foreign capital would be acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. If possible we should like to have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>’s dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> placed on a regular, scheduled
                        basis, perhaps alternating with Vice President Baghdadi.</p>
                    <p>The proposed letter from the President to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is envisaged as a follow-up to our commitments to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>, a progress report, an
                        encouragement for the future, an expression of continued personal interest
                        in <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and a means of encouraging <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> moderation on any global or area issues
                        then current.</p>
                    <p>In the Fall we expect the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> to begin its
                        pre-consortium examination of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. By
                        then we should have completed the negotiation of the multi-year <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 agreement and shall be processing <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> applications for development loans within
                        the terms of our commitment to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. The
                        next major move we have in mind is an invitation to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> for a state visit to the US. Our
                        thinking has been in terms of December, the invitation to be issued after
                        the <hi rend="italic">US</hi> elections on November 6 if circumstances
                        permit. However, we think we should have an alternate date available in
                        February 1963 in the event that a) Tito comes to the US before the end of
                        1962 or b) the circumstances indicate that the later date would fit better
                        into our moves as planned next Fall. An invitation to Ben-Gurion sometime in
                        1963 would appear to be desirable if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> comes here. With <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> we would propose the discussion of global issues,
                            US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations, area problems, the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> domestic scene, and the possibility
                        of an informal arms limitation understanding with the US playing broker.
                        Providing the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> has laid the proper

                    <p>To go beyond this point in our thinking for the new phase would seem

                    <p>My brother Bill’s memorandum of his conversation with this gentleman<note n="1" xml:id="d277fn1"><ref target="#d273">Document 273</ref>.</note>
                        reminds me that I have not reported on my own talk with him.</p>
                    <p>The central point in <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>’ remarks to
                        me was that the maintenance of a stable and strong Israel was a service to
                        peace in which the United States should take an increasing share. The
                        particular item which he emphasized was the defense of the three operational
                        Israeli air bases by Hawk missiles. He would like to buy them with some help
                        from us, in a fashion undefined.</p>
                    <p>The rest of his argument was mainly embellishment and statistical
                        argumentation designed to make the point that this was now a necessary
                        contribution to the stabilization of the Middle East. He also appeared to
                        believe that we should gradually get into a steady relation of military
                        assistance to Israel, and I think it is predictable that he will have been
                        making this point to Zionist leaders in this country.</p>
                    <p>I asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> what he thought about
                        nuclear weapons in the Middle East, and he said that it would be better for
                        Israel if they could be kept out, but that if there were signs that others
                        might move in this direction, Israel would of course have to consider her
                        own position.</p>

                        <item><p><hi rend="italic">Israel’s Security</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said in atmosphere of
                                uncertainty surrounding Israel Government and public his
                                interpretation USG’s professions intent to support Israel in case of
                                assault had not dispelled anxiety since assurances USG would be
                                involved if Israel attacked, and that USG had so informed Arabs, had
                                to be qualified by statement USG would not relax its policy re arms
                                supply nor engage in contingency planning. His statement that in
                                case of trouble situation would be discussed on diplomatic level had
                                been disappointing. Secretary commented that this is mode of
                                communication between governments; that decisions could not be made
                                by “colonels on both sides”. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> agreed, but said he assumed US policy
                                implying military involvement would be reflected in advance joint
                                planning and prior establishment agreed channels military
                                communication.</p>
                            <p>In response to Secretary’s query re arms balance as assessed by
                                Israel’s military, <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                                reported no concern for immediate future but great deal for two or
                                three years hence. He described <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                                as key problem since its naval forces so far ahead Israel not even
                                trying keep abreast; its infantry increasing from 11 to 14 brigades;
                                its armor from four to nine brigades; and its ground carrier fleet
                                tripled. Israel’s major vulnerability remains air attack since Egypt
                                has received eight TU–16 long-range bombers which can operate from
                                bases deep in Egypt far beyond Israel’s attack range. In addition,
                                    <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21s are on way, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> pilots having had preliminary
                                training. Israel believes <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to
                                receive ground-to-air missiles in use of which it probably has also
                                had prior training. While USG’s overtures to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may impose restraining
                                influence, this is calculated risk to Israel’s security suggesting
                                USG should give Israel compensatory or counter-balancing
                                gesture.</p>
                            <p>Secretary referred to Department assurances to Deputy Defense
                                Minister <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 755)<note n="1" xml:id="d278fn1"><ref target="#d275">Document 275</ref>.</note>
                                that US would re-study Israel’s security position. He asked

                                appropriate, he said, no conclusions should be drawn as to its

                            policy, would be helpful if colloquium initiated year ago between heads
                            of state could be resumed especially as both governments are agreed
                            mounting tensions may lie ahead in Near East. He said US initiative
                            might spark continuation of this colloquium which could clear
                            “psychological deck”. Secretary was noncommittal.</item>

                        <item><p><hi rend="italic">Direct Negotiations</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> found Israel very critical of
                                US vote against Brazzaville Resolution. Of all world conflicts only
                                in Palestine complex is negotiation rejected as matter of principle.
                                Direct negotiation resolution would have strengthened hands of those
                                Arabs who are resigned to inevitable settlement with Israel.
                                Secretary asked whether there are such Arabs and emphasized that US
                                enthusiastically supports direct negotiations if there is slightest
                                prospect of success. If such prospect exists, Israel has means to
                                learn about it and also US antennae would be among first to react to
                                evidence such possibility.</p>
                            <p>On <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>’s expression
                                dissatisfaction with Brazzaville Resolution and US role in April 9
                                Security Council resolution, Secretary remarked Israel Government
                                was fully aware in advance of US attitude. On Brazzaville
                                Resolution, Israel had been informed that US preferred no resolution
                                but Israel had gone ahead to inspire just such resolution. Israel of
                                course is not US satellite but contrary also true. Similarly Israel
                                could be in no doubt as to US attitude towards retaliatory raid.
                                Secretary said he hopes he has made clear that if Israel relies on
                                US support, US is entitled to be consulted.</p></item>

                            caught up. On the other hand, I hope that over time it will prove (like

                    <p>The attached State memorandum on future policy toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss><note n="1" xml:id="d279fn1"><ref target="#d276">Document 276</ref>.</note> is to keep you informed of
                        State’s thinking on the next steps in this important foreign policy
                        experiment. You will want to keep close tabs on its evolution, because of
                        its high domestic sensitivity and the repercussions it is already creating
                        elsewhere in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>To sum up State’s view, it is “so far so good.” <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has responded favorably to the bait we have offered
                        in the form of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 and other aid; largely
                        as a result, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> behavior has been quite
                        moderate over the past several months.</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> visit was apparently
                        viewed by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as a test of our
                        good intentions. We were quite forthcoming, though far short of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> bids. We promised $20 million in
                        stabilization credits if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> met <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> terms (they have) plus up to another $10
                        million to match other contributions. We promised to consider favorably some
                        $51 million in development loans, and committed ourselves to 400,000 tons
                        more of Title I wheat. Though all this seems impressive, it is in fact just
                        enough to keep <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> afloat
                        economically; so we haven’t gone too far yet.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand the Shah, Saud, <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, and the Israelis are all vocally unhappy at the
                        shift in our policy. They are not persuaded by our argument that if we don’t

                    </list>
                    <p>By telephone call to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> May 21, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> asked why, when other Governments contemplate the
                        establishment of a diplomatic mission in Jerusalem, we review with them the
                        United States position on non-recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>A resolution of the United Nations General Assembly adopted November 29,
                        1947, provided for the partition of Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish
                        state and the creation of a corpus separatum, under direct international
                        administration, of the City of Jerusalem and its environs. This resolution
                        could not be carried out since hostilities broke out in May 1948 between
                        Arab states and Israel. The hostilities were terminated by a series of
                        armistice agreements in 1949. The armistice agreement <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0749"/>between Israel and Jordan of April 3, 1949,
                        established armistice demarcation lines which divided Jerusalem into sectors
                        under Israel and Jordan control with a no-man’s-land between the two
                        sectors. The United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1949, reaffirmed
                        its recommendation that a corpus separatum be established, and requested the
                        Trusteeship Council to proceed with formulating a Statute for a Corpus
                        Separatum for Jerusalem. The United States and certain other interested
                        powers did not support this resolution, which was, nevertheless, passed by
                        the Assembly. It was the belief of this Government that events had made
                        efforts at carrying out the terms of such a resolution unrealistic, inasmuch
                        as the two countries in actual occupation of Jerusalem were strongly opposed
                        to the creation of a corpus separatum. The Trusteeship Council failed to
                        produce an acceptable draft statute as did the United Nations General
                        Assembly that same year (1950). The United States undertook, however, to
                        give due recognition to the formal acts of the General Assembly and the
                        Trusteeship Council relating to Jerusalem and has since maintained its
                        position that the Holy Places in the Jerusalem area are of international
                        interest to a degree which transcends ordinary considerations of
                        sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>Despite the passage of the 1949 United Nations General Assembly resolution,
                        the Israel Government officially transferred the Israel capital to
                        Jerusalem. Israel Ministers began moving to the city, but the Foreign
                        Ministry remained in Tel Aviv for a period. On May 4, 1952, the Israel
                        Government announced that it was transferring the Foreign Office to
                        Jerusalem. The actual transfer took place as of July 12, 1953. On July 9,
                        1952, the Embassy at Tel Aviv handed an aide-mémoire to the Israel
                        Government (enclosed)<note n="1" xml:id="d281fn1">For text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v09p1#pg_961"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                    Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. IX, Part 1, p. 961</ref>.</note>
                        stating that the United States Government did not view favorably the
                        transfer of the Israel Foreign Office to Jerusalem, and that there was no
                        intention of transferring the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to
                        Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>Our position, as frequently stated, is: “the status of Jerusalem is a matter
                        of United Nations concern and no member of the United Nations should take
                        any action to prejudice the United Nations interest in this question. Our
                        objective has been to keep the Jerusalem question an open one and to prevent
                        its being settled solely through the processes of attrition and fait
                        accompli to the exclusion of international interest and an eventual final
                        expression thereof presumably through the United Nations.”</p>
                    <p>As a consequence of this policy, when the Department learns that a government
                        for the first time is contemplating the establishment of a diplomatic
                        mission in Israel, we inform that government of the historical <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0750"/>background of United Nations attitudes
                        toward Jerusalem and express the hope that, in deference to United Nations
                        attitudes, its mission will be established in Tel Aviv, where most other
                        missions are located. (This approach is almost invariable, although we would
                        not undertake it in the case of a government hostile to the United States
                        because our effort might be self-defeating.) We are at pains to inform the
                        government that the decision is one for it to make. If, despite our friendly
                        counsels, the government desires to establish its mission in Jerusalem the
                        United States Government makes no further effort to dissuade it. The view of
                        our major allies on the Jerusalem problem is generally similar to our own.
                        They also have on occasion made representations to other states regarding
                        the establishment of diplomatic missions in Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>The Department’s files show that since Israel’s transfer of its capital to
                        Jerusalem we have made approaches along the foregoing lines to the following
                        countries: <table rows="13" cols="3">

                    <p>As of March 1962, of the 41 nations maintaining diplomatic missions in
                        Israel, eleven were located in Jerusalem, four of these, however, sharing
                        one resident Ambassador.<note n="2" xml:id="d281fn2">A footnote in the
                            source text lists Central Africa, Gabon, Greece, Netherlands, Guatemala,
                            Venezuela, and Uruguay. Dahomey, Ivory Coast, Niger, and Upper Volta
                            were listed as four “Conseil d’Entente” nations represented by a single
                            Ambassador.</note> This group includes six African and three Latin
                        American states. The two others are Greece and the Netherlands, both of
                        which are regarded as respecting the status of Jerusalem since these
                        governments designated their consular representatives to mandated Jerusalem
                        as diplomatic representatives to the newly created State of Israel, leaving
                        their consular residences in the original location.</p>
                    <p>The United States practice (of informing states which may be considering the
                        establishment of a diplomatic mission in Israel of the background <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0751"/>of United Nations interest) is
                        known to Israel. The latter has occasionally taken issue with the practice,
                        most recently in January of this year.<note n="3" xml:id="d281fn3">See <ref target="#d167">Document 167</ref>. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> also raised the matter with <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> during their meeting on May 28. The
                            memorandum of conversation is in Department of State, Central Files,
                            684A.00/5–2862.</note> We have invariably replied that the United States
                        feels it has a moral obligation in this issue; that the United Nations
                        interest is a legitimate one; on this premise we make our views known to
                        interested governments; however, each government must decide its position
                        for itself.</p>

                            not sure he realizes that our long-term ability to promote steps toward
                            an A–I settlement depends largely on a sufficiently even-handed attitude
                            toward Arab and Israeli to give us leverage with Arabs. As you know, I
                            agree that pendulum has swung sufficiently that compensatory gestures
                            toward Israel desirable, but I believe that: (1) what Israelis really
                            need and want is reaffirmation of our security guarantee; (2) we should
                            use this prospect to get certain concessions from them.”</note></head>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Mike—</p>
                    <p>My reaction to State’s 29 May report<note n="1" xml:id="d282fn1">See <ref target="#d280fn2">footnote 2, Document 280</ref>.</note> is that we
                        ought to pursue a rather more active, though still “quiet”, diplomacy on
                        Arab-Israeli issues. I’m disturbed by the trend toward hotting up of A–I
                        problem: (1) in anticipation of Israeli diversion of Jordan waters; (2) as
                        part of the recurrent efforts by one Arab state or another to score points
                        on yet other Arab countries for being soft on Israel. Recently the Syrians
                        and Iraqis <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0752"/>and now the Saudis and
                        Jordanians are taking this line, aimed obviously at <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. No doubt one aim is to force
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> into a more actively
                        anti-Israeli policy and thus queer his relations with us. Then too all Arabs
                        love to use the Palestine issue as a popular diversion from their own
                        domestic failings.</p>
                    <p>We ought to ask State to include in its 1 July report less of an apologia for
                        past actions (or inaction) and more of an action program of future moves
                        aimed at forestalling a new rise in A–I frictions (especially over Jordan
                        waters) and perhaps laying the groundwork for moves toward ultimate
                        settlement. As you know, the general consensus that this is a well-nigh
                        intractable problem which only time (if that) will cure has led to a certain
                        feeling in State that there’s not much we can do.</p>
                    <p>For my part, however, I’d like to see the following explored: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Measures to sustain a balance between Arabs and Israel (e.g. some
                                form of new security guarantee, perhaps Hawk air defense missiles,
                                the proposed exchange of assurances on Jordan waters). Such measures
                                will also signal clearly to the Arab states that our new policies do
                                not betoken any lessened interest in Israel’s security.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Possibilities of talking <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> into holding back his Soviet arms purchases
                                if we keep lid on Israelis (this at least will serve to justify our
                                stand if we later sell Hawks to Israelis).</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>More active effort to get Jordan and Saudis to tone down their
                                current noisemaking. I can’t understand why, when we’re subsidizing
                                Jordan so heavily, we don’t tell them to lay off this silly new
                                Palestine plan of theirs.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>A stronger push behind Joe Johnson’s refugee efforts (though this
                                might be counter-productive).</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>A tough line with Israelis not to rock the boat, and to
                                collaborate more effectively with UNEF and <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>A set of quiet but persistent diplomatic and other initiatives
                                designed to remind Arabs that a third round against Israel is
                                futile. We’re too cautious about telling Arabs the score.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>None of above are new, and all have their disadvantages. But my basic point
                        is that we ought to be forehanded in anticipating new trouble in the Near
                        East, not just sit back and wait for it.</p>

                        to build this around a public statement by Israel to which we would make a
                        public response. Also I believe we could work in certain dams for Jordan as
                        a part of the quid pro quo to the Arabs.</p>

                                memorandum (Tab A) with accompanying note has not been cleared by
                                    <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss>. A memorandum from Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> to you raising
                                several questions is attached. (Tab B) My memorandum omits reference
                                to the impact of the note on Israel. We believe the assurances
                                provided in the note are of fundamental importance to Israel and
                                would be welcomed. That the entire note would be accepted and
                                responded to uncritically might be too much to hope for. We can
                                expect an effort by Israel to evade or to negotiate away the
                                reciprocal assurances we seek, to argue over the water allocations,
                                to seek specific expression of how we propose to help Jordan on the
                                Yarmuk, to seek definition of the type of international supervision
                                we envision in the absence of implementation of the entire Unified
                                Plan, etc. In the last analysis, however, we believe Israel will
                                recognize the necessity for giving reciprocal assurance and will do
                                so. It is an Israel practice to seek far more than it expects to
                                gain and to maintain a dissatisfied mien even when pleased, which in
                                this case Israel would have every reason to be.”</note></head>

                        <p>Since the Syrian-Israel clashes on and near Lake Tiberias culminating in

                                            on our relations with some of the Arabs, notably the
                                            Syrians. In our opinion there is no satisfactory
                                            alternative. However, their reaction will be much more
                                            bitter if Israel proceeds to withdraw water without U.S.
                                            action to safeguard Arab interests. Our request to
                                            Israel for reciprocal assurances is to preserve as best

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to state that
                            recent events which have occurred in the Lake Tiberias area have drawn
                            attention to the question of the rights and obligations of the parties
                            in the area and in particular to the effectiveness of the peace-keeping
                            machinery established under the Israel-Syria General Armistice
                            Agreement. Central among our several concerns is the determination to
                            prevent, if possible, an insupportable strain on sensitive area
                            relationships resulting from controversy over the waters of the Jordan
                            Valley.</p>
                        <p>As Israel and her Arab neighbors have long known, the United States
                            Government believes it is in the best interests of all concerned that
                            these water resources be peacefully and fully developed for the progress
                            and prosperity of the area. Proposals for the equitable distribution and
                            full utilization of the resources of the Jordan River system were
                            accepted by Israel and the affected Arab states at the technical level
                            in 1955. While the prospect of international agreement continues remote,
                            it is the United States view that stabilization of the Near East and a
                            more durable peace will not be advanced by prolonging the period during
                            which riparians along the Jordan River system are denied equitable
                            shares of this important natural resource by intra-area rivalries. In a
                            degree these rivalries are perpetuated and exacerbated by the delay in
                            division of the waters.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government considers that Israel’s use of the waters of
                            the lake within equitable limits would be in accordance with the general
                            principles of international law governing international river systems.
                            Therefore, when withdrawal of water from the lake becomes necessary for
                            Israel’s continued development, it is the view of the United States
                            Government that Israel will be justified in carrying its water
                            development project to completion.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, upon receipt of the affirmation described hereafter, the
                            United States Government is prepared to inform the other riparians along
                            the Jordan River system that it considers Israel to be justified in
                            taking an equitable share of the river water, using Lake Tiberias as a
                            point of diversion. Further, the United States Government, as
                            circumstances require, will support diplomatic efforts by Israel to
                            obtain general <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0758"/>international
                            approval of its withdrawal of water from Lake Tiberias. The United
                            States Government likewise will wish to support the efforts of other
                            riparians to create means of employing their allocations of water under
                            the Unified Plan for the Development of the Jordan River Valley
                                (<persName>Johnston</persName> Plan). I should like to emphasize
                            that the ability of the United States Government effectively to support
                            Israel’s water use plan is dependent upon action by Israel to assure
                            that the onus for tensions in the area will not fall on Israel. In the
                            belief that it is in Israel’s interest to cooperate fully with the
                            United Nations and to conduct a policy of restraint along Israel’s
                            borders, the United States Government will wish to explore with the
                            Government of Israel means of strengthening the effectiveness of the
                            United Nations machinery in the area. The United States Government will
                            also hold discussions to this end with the Syrian Arab Republic and with
                            other governments.</p>
                        <p>In the interest of prompt and effective implementation of the line of
                            action described above, the United States Government will appreciate
                            receiving early affirmation of what it understands to be the position of
                            the Government of Israel as follows: <list>

                        <p>In general, I agree that we should assure the Israelis we support
                            withdrawal of waters from the Jordan by Israel on the understanding that
                            it will agree to take no more than the capacity allocated to it by the
                            Unified Plan and it will cooperate in establishing effective means for
                            assuring impartial supervision over the use of the waters. However,
                            since there are a number of aspects of the problem which deserve careful
                            exploration, I believe it would be useful, if you would agree, to
                            convene a meeting of the interested bureaus to consider the following
                            questions: <list>

                                <item>Israel is not expected to begin withdrawal of water before
                                    mid- 1963. Is it necessary therefore to provide appropriate
                                    assurances at this time while we are actively engaged in
                                    supporting the Johnson Mission? Could the question of assurances
                                    be postponed until early 1963?</item>

                    <p>We may be heading for another crisis in Iran. Plan Organization and 3d Plan
                        are in a parlous state, new budget is so big that either plan will have to
                        be postponed or big US loan needed and Shah is making noises about much
                        bigger <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> package than we offered.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> is fatigued and seems to

                        Shah’s visit). And I’ve been arguing we should run scared nonetheless. A
                        stitch in time, you know.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, Shah continues to recall promises we can’t track down. Latest is
                        alleged JFK promise we’d underwrite a 2,000-man commando brigade for Tehran
                        riot control. As I recall, JFK and Shah discussed internal security problem
                        at dinner; President thought Shah not interested enough in this and we
                        subsequently told <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> to look into
                        what more we could do. (We’re working now on a program submitted by
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>.)</p>

                            United States and Kuwait, prepared on May 29, 1962, indicates <persName corresp="#p_JH2">Jawad</persName>’s remarks of December 26, 1961, as
                            the first warning received from Iraq. (Ibid., 611.86D/5–2961)</note> and
                        could not in honor and honesty go back on our agreement. Pointed out I had
                        given him no cause at any time to believe US Government would change its
                        mind. Reminded him further that we basically disagree on merits Iraq’s claim
                        to Kuwait and gave him summary of legal and historical reasoning contained
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> memo of May 2<note n="3" xml:id="d286fn3">Not found.</note> on Iraqi claim to Kuwaiti and Saudi
                        territory. Added that I thought Iraq was itself to blame in having brought
                        about present situation by adopting unnecessary policy. With reference to
                        legal and historical arguments, <persName corresp="#p_JH2">Jawad</persName>
                        countered that Iraq had great pile of documents, including some from British
                        Foreign Office itself, which it could present to counter any points it might
                        make and insisted there could be no doubt justice Iraqi claim. Refused to
                        admit Iraqi policy on diplomatic relations was mistaken or unnecessary.</p>
                    <p>He and I both expressed regret that matters had come to this point and I
                        again remarked to unfortunate tendency <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        policy was having in reducing [garble] between Iraq and non-communist
                        countries. Went on to say I hoped, nevertheless, that recall of Ambassadors
                        would not have substantive effect on our relations. <persName corresp="#p_JH2">Jawad</persName> minimized practical importance of
                        reduction of level representation in our case as in others and said that so
                        far as he was concerned he expected matters to proceed normally both in
                        regard to American Embassy Baghdad and Iraqi Embassy Washington. I said I
                        believed this would be our own wish and expectation and that I knew of no
                        plans to change character of our Embassy here. I did point out, however,
                        that withdrawal of Ambassadors was of at least some importance because of
                        psychological impact it could have on popular opinion.</p>
                    <p>Minister then took initiative to say that he himself wanted to retain British
                        and American Ambassadors and Embassies here because they <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0764"/>were of importance to Iraq and he still
                        hoped our respective relations could be friendly and could improve. We
                        should realize on both sides that there were areas of agreement as well as
                        disagreement and should try to increase the former. I replied I heartily
                        agreed and regretted that Iraqi attitudes did not always seem to reflect
                        this philosophy. Arabs in particular, I said, seemed to feel that if anyone
                        did something they did not like they must automatically be opposed to that
                        nation or individual in everything. <persName corresp="#p_JH2">Jawad</persName> admitted there was tendency to go to extremes in Arab
                        countries but asked for understanding on grounds of their political
                        immaturity. I then asked whether he could see any possibility of breaking
                        Kuwaiti deadlock in which Iraq found itself in relation to us and to others.
                        His only answer was a smile and the remark that he was an incurable optimist
                        even when things looked black.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I told <persName corresp="#p_JH2">Jawad</persName> of my unchanged
                        plan to attend Athens Ambassadorial conference,<note n="4" xml:id="d286fn4">Reference is to the Conference of Chiefs of Mission accredited to Near

                        and my hope it would be possible for me to return Baghdad for very short
                        time afterwards in order pack up and organize my family for trip to US. He
                        said there was no hurry about my departure but looked doubtful about
                        suggestion that I return after once having left. Said he would have to think
                        about this and would let me know his opinion shortly.</p>
                    <p>Conversation was amicable and calm throughout, when I left Minister assured
                        me there was nothing personal in request for my recall and that he would be
                        happy to see me again under better circumstances. In reply my tentative
                        query, he said he would be glad to receive me if I had time to make a
                        farewell call before my departure.<note n="5" xml:id="d286fn5">On June 2,

                            that reads: “My face is exceedingly red over failing to let you know

                            from Baghdad. Of course no break in relations is involved. This has been
                            a standard Iraqi gambit with every country (Japan, Lebanon, Jordan)
                            which has exchanged ambassadors with Kuwait after an Iraqi warning, and
                            we had long been on notice that it was likely in our case too. Indeed we
                            took the basic risk sometime ago when we, along with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the other Arab states, recognized
                            Kuwait’s independence. Your staff was fully in accord with this
                            decision. I can only say that next time when the White House signs off
                            on something, we’ll make sure that the President knows about it too.”

                    <p>I wonder if we shouldn’t take advantage of <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName>’s return for a thoroughgoing re-appraisal of our
                        Iraq policy. The Italian Ambassador’s recent gloomy prognosis (Baghdad
                            544)<note n="1" xml:id="d287fn1">Dated June 1. (Ibid.,
                            787.00/6–162)</note> seems to represent the consensus of informed
                        observers that (1) there is a “slow but steady swing … toward Soviet orbit”;
                        (2) Kassem’s popularity is at a new low; (3) his overthrow is sooner or
                        later inevitable, with unpredictable results.</p>
                    <p>Given US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> interests in Iraq and its
                        proximity to a floundering Iran, it seems prudent to ask ourselves again
                        whether essentially a “wait and see” policy is still valid. It probably is
                        (as I note Embassy Baghdad Dispatch 735 concludes)<note n="2" xml:id="d287fn2">Dated May 21. (Ibid., 660.87/5–2162)</note> simply
                        because of the lack of promising alternatives. But why not at least review
                        ways in which we might more positively influence the course of events? Would
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> have any ideas; how about another
                        talk with the British; indeed it might even be worthwhile to solicit <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> views. We certainly want to put ourselves
                        in the best position to (1) react quickly to a change of regime in Iraq; (2)
                        counter an accelerated drift toward the Bloc. The Embassy Baghdad dispatch,
                        for example, has a number of good suggestions for meeting the first
                        contingency.</p>
                    <p>Judging from this gloomy dispatch, the skull and sophistication of Soviet
                        penetration in Iraq compares favorably with that in Afghanistan as noted by
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>. While Iraq is a
                        long way from being as vulnerable (for obvious geographic reasons), it is
                        sufficiently so to be most worrisome.</p>

                    <p>In response to questions from Department officers, Dr. Johnson commented as
                        follows on his just completed (April–May) “second round” trip to the Arab
                        host countries and Israel: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item><p><hi rend="italic">General Climate:</hi> Both Arabs and Israelis
                                    were uniformly friendly to Johnson personally, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> possibly excepted. On the
                                    Arab side, despite the fairly “stale” resolution adopted by the
                                    Arab League at the Riyadh meeting, there is less rigidity of
                                    thought, “more viscosity,” than was evident in September 1961.
                                    There is a sense of movement—even if the Arabs are dissatisfied
                                    with its direction—and a fumbling for some new position, perhaps
                                    a Palestine “entity,” a “liberation” force, or a simple
                                    long-range building of strength. Johnson counseled the Arabs
                                    very strongly on the futility of any such moves. The Arabs were
                                    invariably told that as a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                    official Johnson had to recognize that Israel existed. Not once
                                    was this challenged. There is a change in attitudes towards
                                    Israel’s permanence, or at least semi-permanence. There is a
                                    concern with practical things such as where compensation will
                                    come from.</p>
                                <p>Israel not only does not want any refugees back but would prefer
                                    no Arabs in Israel. Its drive is toward “uncompromising
                                    exclusivity.” The Arabs are “second class” citizens, a fact
                                    recognized in Arab arguments that there can be no refugee return
                                    to “Israel” as such. Manifestly, also, Israel has a distaste for
                                    anything connected with the United Nations.</p></item>

                            <item><p><hi rend="italic">Program:</hi> The first task is for the
                                    Special Representative to define specific proposals which come
                                    as close as possible to what each side might reasonably accept
                                    in the light of its security and other national interests as
                                    communicated to Johnson during the “second round.” The concept
                                    of a pilot project within a given maximum number of refugees
                                    (20,000) was rejected by both sides and must be abandoned.
                                    Therefore, procedures must be evolved for finding out what the
                                    refugees want, for counseling them in confidence as to the
                                    alternatives realistically open to them, etc., in such a way
                                    that Israel will not see this process as a hazard to its
                                    existence. The proposal must be simple, must anticipate
                                    arguments from all sides, and must be predicated on acquiescence
                                    rather than cooperation of governments. It must be accompanied
                                    by statements that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot
                                    assure implementation, that preferences can be changed, and that
                                    implementation will in any case take time. Equally, compensation
                                    must be carefully studied. It must be paid for more than just
                                    loss of property. From some source, it must also be provided to
                                    those who return to Israel and cannot take up residence in their
                                    old <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0769"/>homes. In all, an
                                    estimated $1.4 billion ($1500 per refugee) will be required for
                                    compensation.</p>
                                <p>When the Special Representative’s proposals have been elaborated,
                                    it will be necessary for them to be examined and endorsed by the
                                    highest levels of the US Government.</p>
                                <p>After quiet approval by the US, possibly some time in September
                                    or October, the Senior Advisor to the Special Representative
                                    would personally deliver the text of the proposal to the Arab
                                    host governments and Israel. The Senior Advisor would entertain
                                    suggestions but the Special Representative himself would not
                                    further negotiate his own proposal. At the same time a process
                                    of quiet consultation with other key governments (the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, France, Netherlands, India,
                                    Ghana, etc.) would be initiated.</p>
                                <p>At the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, the final text of
                                    the proposal would be floated, if possible about mid-November.
                                    If it is a reasonable proposal that reasonable nations weary of
                                    the problem can adhere to, and the parties reject it, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can properly say it has tried,
                                    failed, and can henceforth wash its hands of
                                responsibility.</p></item>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> seems primarily
                                    concerned with domestic developments. He will have no interest
                                    in progress on the refugees in Gaza, where the problem seems
                                    unsolvable, but must be persuaded at least to remain neutral and
                                    not make trouble elsewhere.</p>
                                <p>Sanctions with the Arabs include the threat that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will wash its hands of

                                    admittedly not a credible deterrent), the Special
                                    Representative’s final report, and the threatened passage of
                                    Israel’s direct negotiations resolution.</p>
                                <p>Sanctions with Israel lie primarily in the hands of the U.S. But
                                    there is additionally the threat of Israel’s isolation from
                                    reasonable nations in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if
                                    it has rejected a fair proposal that the Arabs have accepted.
                                    United States supporters of Israel can perhaps be helpful. There
                                    are also some very divided councils in Israel. Israel will not
                                    like the recording of refugee preferences, even if these are
                                    kept confidential, but there is the possibility of a U.S.-Israel
                                    understanding as to the maximum repatriation the U.S. will
                                    support, perhaps also a U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                                    understanding, outside the cognizance of the Special
                                    Representative. If a procedure for recording refugee preferences
                                    does go forward, it should do so under an individual, perhaps on

                            and the Arabs and of its effect on Israel’s security. Over a period of
                            years we have come to learn what can be done on behalf of Israel without
                            creating serious tensions with the Arabs.</p>

                            Tactics.</hi></p>
                        <p>During the first year or so of the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Administration, Israel appeared principally to
                            watch developments, creating no major issues, but constantly probing
                            relatively gently in such areas as a security guarantee, military
                            equipment, military relationships, economic assistance, cooperation in
                            technical assistance to third countries, and an Israel relationship with
                            the Common Market and the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the opening gun of the current major offensive was the so-called
                            “Brazzaville resolution” of December 1961 inspired originally by Israel
                            and sponsored by 15 other members, principally African, of the General
                            Assembly calling upon Israel and the Arabs to conduct direct peace
                            negotiations for the settlement of the Palestine conflict. US opposition
                            to this resolution has been a source of continuing criticism of the US
                            Government, to a limited extent by Israeli officials, but on a
                            considerable scale by Israel’s American sympathizers. The criticism
                            increasingly has been linked by domestic critics to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>’s campaign statements calling
                            for a comprehensive settlement in the Near East. Statements are
                            appearing more frequently to the effect that it is time for the
                            President to redeem his campaign pledges.</p>
                        <p>A steady campaign of criticism has flowed also from the Security Council
                            resolution of April 9 censuring Israel for its retaliatory raid and only
                            deploring Syrian “hostile acts.” Israel’s action is portrayed as being
                            necessary to defense of its security in the absence of prompt and
                            effective <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action.</p>
                        <p>In addition, fingers are pointed at the hostile propaganda conducted by
                            the Arabs against Israel, the indoctrination of young Arabs with hatred
                            of Israel, the increasing Soviet armaments (particularly <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0773"/>aircraft) reportedly being acquired by
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Syria, the strengthening of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> by expanded US economic
                            assistance, and the declaration by the Arabs that large-scale withdrawal
                            by Israel in 1963–64 of Jordan waters will be a casus belli.</p>
                        <p>The ensemble of these arguments appears designed to point to a growing
                            threat to Israel’s security and a need for measures by the US to redress
                            the balance. No doubt Israel is concerned that with an Algerian
                            settlement France will reduce its support. We are sure neither the
                            Israelis nor their supporters in the US believe it possible to achieve a
                            peace settlement in the Near East or to eliminate hostile propaganda or
                            teachings. We have evidence from several sources that Israel expected to
                            be condemned for its retaliatory raid of March 16–17. We believe the
                            Israelis intellectually understand that a better US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relation is useful to Israel. While
                            they are concerned at a possible <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            surprise air strike, they have a variety of means of assuring effective
                            defense. They know that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has the
                            means to acquire Soviet arms whether the US assists the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> economically or not. The Israelis also
                            know that their water diversion system cannot be damaged seriously from
                            the air and that Syria cannot successfully mount a ground action to
                            destroy the pumping station.</p>
                        <p>While American Jewry has concentrated on the need for an overall
                            settlement, we believe the recent visit of Israel’s Deputy Minister of
                            Defense, <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Shimon Peres</persName>, has brought
                            into focus the true Israel objectives. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>’s call on you on May 28 tends to
                            confirm our thesis. A principal argument used by both <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> was that the US, having worsened Israel’s
                            position by aiding the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, should now
                            make a compensatory gesture to Israel. The fact that <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> did not mention Israel’s desire
                            for a United States assurance on Israel’s right to Jordan waters may
                            well stem from his understanding that such an assurance will be
                            forthcoming. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>’ principal
                            concerns seemed to be a) an arrangement for continuing military
                            consultations between Israel and the US, b) bolstering of Israel’s air
                            defenses by acquisition of the Hawk missile system, and the Minister of
                            the Israeli Embassy proposed in the context of <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>’ visit a c) security guarantee by
                            letter from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> to
                            Prime Minister Ben-Gurion.</p>
                        <p>Thus, we believe that considerable pressure will be mounted against the
                            Administration domestically in the context of the President’s campaign

                            Israel has pressed in past years for both the Hawk missile system and
                            US- Israel military consultations, as well as for a security guarantee.
                            It seems reasonable to assume that in this election year another
                            “college try” will be made by Israel and its supporters here and that a

                        <p>The latest “Israel-Arab Situation” report prepared by the intelligence
                            community is dated December 1961. The next revision is due in June.
                            Dealing with military factors alone, the report of last December does
                            indicate certain Israeli vulnerability to air attack, but points to
                            continuation of Israeli air superiority, despite acquisition by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> of TU–16 bombers, as a result of
                            Israel’s purchase of Mirage III aircraft, some of which have now been
                            delivered. Israel’s clear military superiority on the ground

                                    its peaceful nature. This course of action should be sufficient
                                    to remove temptation for a surprise <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-Syrian

                            an Arab assault now and is not likely to be in any real danger over the
                            next few years. In <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> we consider this

                                Israel.</hi></p>
                        <p>Our problems with Israel stem largely from: a) unrequited Israeli desires
                            for the establishment of a special relationship between Israel and <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0775"/>the US in matters of national
                            security, and b) Arab-Israel frictions along Israel’s borders. Although
                            Israel has sought US sponsorship of training in Israel for third-country
                            nationals, has proposed cooperative US- Israel ventures in technical aid
                            to third countries, objects to our policy of suggesting to other
                            countries that they establish diplomatic missions in Tel Aviv rather
                            than in Jerusalem, and differs with us on the question of sovereignty
                            over Lake Tiberias, these matters are of relatively minor consequence to
                            the tenor of our relations.</p>
                        <p>We believe that in seeking continuing military consultations with the US
                            and in proposing periodically a US security guarantee, Israel seeks not
                            only reassurance for its own people, but also a clear demonstration to
                            the Arabs that the US is, in effect, allied with Israel. In requesting
                            the US to supply the Hawk missile system Israel seeks to eliminate any
                            vulnerability it may feel to attack by manned aircraft and thus assure
                            the security of Israel against the Arabs until such time as offensive
                            missile systems may be introduced into the Near East.</p>

                        a well-supported position on the Hawk missiles.</p>
                    <p>Look, for example, on page 6 at paragraph (2) a.i. where it is stated that
                        strengthening the weak link in Israel’s defenses would reduce any temptation
                        Israel may have to take preemptive offensive action. To put it this way,
                        rather than that Hawk missiles would help to deter an attack against Israel
                        by modern aircraft being supplied to Egypt by the Soviet Union seems to me
                        very odd.</p>
                    <p>Further, the Hawk is not a counterpoise to similar ground-to-air missiles in
                        the hands of Israel’s neighbors. The Hawk is an anti-aircraft missile not an
                        anti-missile missile. The Hawk as a defensive weapon should be measured
                        against weapons on the other side at which it would be aimed. The question
                        is: Does Egypt have an important air-strike capability against Israel and,
                        if so, does Israel have a sufficiently credible defense against such
                        airstrikes as to provide reasonable security? I recognize that the
                        reciprocal of the same question can be asked about Israel air-strike
                        capability and Arab defenses. But what is relevant to Israel’s need for
                        Hawks is Arab aircraft—not Arab ground-to-air missiles.</p>
                    <p>This needs prompt and further discussion with me.</p>
                    <p>I am not now suggesting what the answer ought to be but I am not clear that
                        we have yet found the basis for reaching a satisfactory answer.<note n="2" xml:id="d291fn2">According to the notes for the Secretary’s Staff

                            of his policies. (Ibid., 888.00/6–162)</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> government is being subjected
                        severe strain resulting from fiscal situation. From outset he was confronted
                        with difficult political, economic and administrative problems. By dint
                        personal drive, reform convictions, political finesse and substantial US
                        political and economic assistance, he has been able continue in office more
                        than year, to initiate land reform program, and to make progress with
                        anti-corruption effort. As yet, however, he has been unable establish
                        cohesive cabinet, significantly improve administration, safeguard integrity
                        of Third Plan, or to establish viable political support his government. In
                        recent months he has slipped badly in part due to evident personal
                        exhaustion and almost inevitable difficulties of compromising conflicting
                        political interests. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>
                        performance in fiscal leadership has been disappointing. He inherited
                        difficult situation which has worsened as 1340 operating expenditures
                        increased 25 percent without compensating actions in revenue field.</p>
                    <p>Despite reiterated efforts this mission, as well as Plan Org and Central Bank
                        advisors, he has drifted with fiscal problem that predictably was heading
                        into serious crisis unless remedial actions were taken. Had this problem
                        been energetically attacked many months ago, it would still have been a most
                        difficult operation in political and economic sense. However, underlying
                        problem has been aggravated by further commitments for additional operating
                        outlays in 1341 and indecisiveness re critical need increase revenue
                        collections; as result difficulty of bringing fiscal situation under control
                        has increased substantially. Belatedly <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has become aware that fiscal situation could
                        contribute to collapse his cabinet and he is attempting reduce budgetary
                        deficit.</p>
                    <p>Total budget deficit has been tentatively identified on order $250 million,
                        about $160 million for the administrative segment and about $90 million for
                        development sector. Revenues are forecast approximately at 1339 level. Oil
                        increases are largely offset by projected declines customs receipts and
                        profits government companies. Tax receipts sluggish due recession with
                        latter contributing factor failure <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> press
                        tax collection and new tax measures. While decision may now be taken <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0781"/>impose new taxes on civil service
                        and others, unlikely that actual short-range benefits such actions would be
                        significant.</p>
                    <p>Administrative expenditure commitments are now at very high levels.
                        Completion Second Plan and other government projects require additional
                        operational and maintenance outlays. The military anticipate a 20 percent
                        increase in defense budget (about $30 million) reportedly for technical
                        improvements. Foreign and domestic obligations re past expenditures
                        represent considerable burden. Carryover unpaid bills on 1340 budgetary
                        authorizations approximate $60 million. Obligations to foreign governments
                        and companies already overdue or falling due this year apparently exceed
                        $100 million spread between operational and development budgets. Main
                        problem, however, has been irrational wage increases for civil servants.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s predecessor, who
                        authorized substantial pay increases for engineer graduates, later loosely
                        interpreted to cover science graduates, fell in large part due his
                        resistance increase for teachers. To mollify latter, <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> authorized almost double pay increase
                        which in combination with engineer/science increases has raised expenditures
                        about $40 million in both 1340 and 1341. Other groups, including police and
                        doctors, have been promised higher salaries. Total potential effect on 1341
                        payroll estimated at $70 million, including cost extending wage increases to
                        employees retired at full base pay.</p>
                    <p>Development budget for 1341 consolidates investment expenditure formerly
                        divided between Ministry ($56 million in 1340) and Plan Organization
                        budgets. Total development program expenditures being projected 22 percent
                        above last year, including cost land distribution and partial completion
                        public building program halted 1340. Indicated development deficit of $92
                        million assumes 55 percent oil revenue allocation for development; $71
                        million interest and principal on foreign loans; $91 million receipts from
                        existing foreign loans and $6.5 million domestic debt retirement. If no
                        expansion of public investment is undertaken for 1341 development deficit
                        would be about $42 million.</p>
                    <p>By filling long-vacant post Finance Minister and by ordering administrative
                        budgets to be cut 15 percent below 1340 levels, <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has taken step in direction reducing deficit.
                        Effectiveness reduction decision limited, however, by apparent intent carry
                        out commitments to teachers, police, military and to agriculture programs
                        related to land reform. As result now appears administrative budget will be
                        pared back, certain obligations will be shifted to capital budget, debt
                        postponements will occur, and certain necessary expenditures will not be
                        made. Given the political and economic rigidities in the present situation,
                        the chances are not bright that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> can
                        reduce the administrative deficit below $60–70 million without strong
                        possibility of breaking the cabinet. While part of this deficit could be
                        covered by bank credit without undue inflationary <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0782"/>consequences, legal and policy problems
                        would be involved since bank charter does not permit credit for <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> operational deficits and cabinet pressure
                        could lead resignation bank officials. To some cabinet members diverting oil
                        revenues from development is preferable to the hard choices in drastically
                        reducing the operational budget and appears a logical adjustment to phased
                        out US grant aid of $30 million last year.</p>
                    <p>Until budget is finally drawn up it is difficult to give precise answers to
                        specific questions contained <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>. At
                        present, however, we do not believe that <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has deliberately changed his declared economic and
                        fiscal policies, namely reasonably balanced budget, essential monetary
                        control, and implementation of Third Plan. However, developments have shown
                        that Prime Minister, while continuing to profess these policies, has not
                        been sufficiently aggressive in dealing with the underlying economic and
                        fiscal situation. As a result the attainment of his policy goals is now in
                        serious jeopardy and his expectation of US financing assistance has
                        apparently grown. While we do not think that he has deliberately shifted
                        from his professed policy positions to an attempt to build a case for
                        assistance, we anticipate that before end month he will present to us a
                        program for fiscal reform and a request for large scale transitional
                        emergency assistance.</p>
                    <p>We also think fact that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has been
                        virtually one-man-show, has in past months drained <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> of his extraordinary energies and has
                        made it almost impossible for him to exercise required degree cabinet
                        discipline and to follow-up on specific remedial measures. With regard to
                        specific support by Shah, we do not feel <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> can have serious complaint; the difficulties
                        confronting him at present time are due far more to actions or inactions of
                        himself or his government than to role of Shah. It would of course be of
                        considerable help to Prime Minister if Shah were to agree to reduction in
                        military budget, but it would probably be too much to expect Shah to bail
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> out of a situation
                        essentially created by <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>In sum, we do not believe Prime Minister has changed his objectives of fiscal
                        responsibility. However, he has permitted situation to develop wherein these
                        goals have been eroded. The chickens have now come home to roost and whether
                        Prime Minister has ability and courage sufficient to undo damage which has
                        been done and to face the serious political disadvantages and repercussions
                        inherent in drastic budgetary cutting remains to be seen. Meanwhile, in
                        conversations with Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Finance Minister and
                        others, we have consistently pressed for a convincing indication that
                        serious effort has been made to correlate expenditures with domestic
                        resources and have made clear that US interest in assisting Iran financially
                        lies in the field of economic development loans and decidedly not in
                        budgetary support. As mentioned above, however, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> persists in belief their situation is <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0783"/>such that flexible emergency financing will
                        be forthcoming in some form.</p>
                    <p>In pursuing the line indicated above, we have not of course given any
                        indication of the possible level and specific form of US aid contemplated
                        this year. As this is significant factor affecting <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> budget planning, it might be useful if Ambassador upon his
                        return were authorized to inform <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> that US
                        willing consider requests up to some selected figure in loans for projects
                        and commodity imports related balance of payment need. As part this strategy
                        clear conditions should be conveyed such as: (a) allocation oil revenues to
                        development remains unchanged, (b) credit expansion to public sector not to
                        exceed $30 million and (c) operational budget expenditures over $30 million
                        deficit to be directly tied to revenue increases. We also recommend for
                        consideration that a fiscal stabilization program, including possibility
                        rescheduling foreign debt repayments, be considered as part of the
                        contemplated September 1962 consortium.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Prime Minister</hi>: I should like to take
                        advantage of the offer you made at the conclusion of our conversations last
                        year to be available for further exchanges of ideas and information. Since
                        that <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0784"/>time, there have been several
                        developments in the matters we discussed, both in the Near East and in other
                        parts of the world. Some have given rise to concern and anxiety; others
                        provide a basis for hope that our ultimate objective of peace in the Near
                        East can be achieved. Throughout this period, however, the United States
                        policy has consistently included among its objectives the security and
                        progress of Israel.</p>
                    <p>I have had reports, most recently, on the discussions between Deputy Defense
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Shimon Peres</persName> and officials of
                        the United States Government, and the matters he presented are currently
                        being carefully examined. The maintenance of Israel’s integrity and
                        independence and her economic progress will continue to engage our full
                        support.</p>
                    <p>I would hope that the present quiescence on the borders of Israel will
                        continue undisturbed. But this should not cause us to relax our efforts to
                        obtain a lasting and permanent peace and good neighborliness between the
                        Arab States and Israel and to resist doctrines of belligerence. I believe
                        you share my feeling that the United Nations, despite any of its
                        imperfections, remains an important bulwark against aggression of any kind.
                        Israel is entitled to have the calm of its borders respected by its
                        neighbors. I hope that your Government will find it possible to cooperate
                        fully with those functions of the United Nations which can be helpful in
                        this regard.</p>
                    <p>My attention has recently been directed toward the advanced state of the
                        program for the full development of water resources in the Near East. This
                        program offers both agriculture and industry exciting prospects. It is
                        dependent upon the implementation of Israel’s plan to draw from the
                        Jordan-Yarmuk River System those waters to which she is entitled under the
                        plan drafted by former United States Ambassador <persName>Eric
                            Johnston</persName>. This project is one which can and should be carried
                        out as scheduled, both by Israel and by its neighbors. Each can then use her
                        fair share of the water system to improve her economy and advance the
                        general welfare of her people.</p>
                    <p>I hope that the water development projects flowing from the technical
                        agreement reached in 1955 can be implemented in an atmosphere of calm and
                        harmony. I am gratified by your reassurances that Israel’s project and the
                        amount of the waters withdrawn will be consistent with the plan.
                        Accordingly, the United States Government will use its own good offices in
                        behalf of the project and support United Nations instrumentalities in the
                        area with a view to insuring its peaceful implementation.</p>
                    <p>It is my conviction that the waters of the Jordan-Yarmuk River System, which
                        have been flowing to waste for so many centuries, can be a constructive
                        force not only for the benefit of the people of the Near East, <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0785"/>but can result in an economic cooperation
                        that will mark a small step forward toward the ultimate objective of
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>In view of the many changes which have taken place since our meeting last
                        year, I would welcome an expression of your own views on the situation in
                        that area, as well as your vantage point.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGB</persName>:</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MES2">Ed Mason</persName> is back from Iran with most
                        gloomy report. He thinks the economic situation an utter mess and <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> all washed up. Politically and
                        physically <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> is a spent force who
                        doesn’t even control his cabinet. As a result, the Iranian budget is about
                        $170 million in deficit, since practically every ministry has upped its
                        share 20–30 per cent.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the Shah sits back doing nothing; he reputedly said <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> is a US man so the US can support
                        him. The Iranians are obviously going to ask for a budgetary loan, perhaps
                        around $60 million. <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Mason</persName> feels
                        budget support would be fatal at this point and would only be postponing the
                        evil day unless the Shah will insist on adequate budget cuts. <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Ed</persName> is so discouraged that he plans to pull
                        his Harvard team out as soon as their contract expires in September.
                            State/<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> reaction seems unduly passive
                        to me. They send messages warning that we’ll give no new budget support but
                        I have urged we also come up with positive suggestions as to how Shah and
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> can best cope with current
                            <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0786"/>mess. What both need at this
                        point is not just exhortations but advice.</p>
                    <p>Shah may be unwilling to shore up <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> without a high-level prod from us. I am thinking of
                        suggesting we give <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>
                        Presidential oral message to take in when he returns to Teheran on 19th. JFK
                        would remind Pahlevi of economic discussions during visit and urge prompt
                        and effective action lest it prove impossible to get Third Plan (and US
                        contribution) under way on schedule.</p>

                        Appreciate analysis <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> and recognize
                        difficulty reaching firm conclusions in light current state <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> budget. Encouraged <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> attempting take steps however
                        belatedly bring budgetary problem under control. It our position which
                        should be made abundantly clear to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> that
                        resolution its fiscal problems primarily a task for Iranian Government
                        itself. In this connection we are puzzled by your comment that it would
                        “probably be too much to expect the Shah to bail <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> out of situation essentially created by <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> himself.” In our view where fault
                        rests for current situation is academic. Fundamental question remains as to
                        who has ability and power to correct it. It clear Shah is paramount
                        authority and he, therefore, able take steps not possible for Prime Minister
                        or others who do not hold his unique authority. Realize Shah interference
                        into daily government business exposes him to direct line of political fire
                        which may weaken his role as key element of stability in country. On other
                        hand current budgetary problems appear pose substantial direct threat to
                        Shah. Under these circumstances suggest Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> encourage Shah bring his power more
                            <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0787"/>fully into play either directly
                        or through support of Amini’s efforts deal with budgetary and development
                        problem. Unless disarray now evident in <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        cleared up, there seems to be little basis for international consultative
                        group meeting in September to discuss Third Plan which presently remains our
                        and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> objective. Wilson, Mid-East
                        Director <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, who arriving Monday, will be

                        and Shah if he sees him. Suggest you seek opportunity discuss with Wilson on
                        his arrival. McDiarmid trip postponed to end of June on Iranian request.</p>
                    <p>In making point that resolution budgetary problem primarily Iranian task, we
                        should avoid giving an impression we favor one method of allocating
                        resources including petroleum revenue over another. It should be made clear
                        difficult choice between satisfying political and economic needs is Iranian
                        responsibility. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> cannot expect foreign
                        assistance will be so generous as to relieve it of this responsibility. In
                        this connection, we are disturbed by substantial evidence that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> assumes solution will be in form of
                        transitional emergency assistance from U.S. What U.S. seeks is evidence of
                        responsible fiscal management. If this condition not met, increased foreign
                        assistance does no more than postpone the inevitable day of reckoning.</p>
                    <p>In view of foregoing, we believe it premature to discuss <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> levels or fix conditions such as those

                        (a) maintenance of peace in Near East and (b) in this context, security of
                        Israel. In interest of own security, Israel pressing us for close military
                        relationship, security guarantees and Hawk missile. Main problem as
                        conference sees it is not a defense “gap” on either side of Arab-Israel
                        quarrel, but danger that if a serious imbalance of vulnerability should
                        develop it would create real and present temptation to pre-emptive attack.
                        Thus conference has considered Hawk as part of overall review, as follows: <list>

                                avoidance ties of this nature as being inconsistent with our basic
                                goal to promote impartially the peaceful resolution of Arab-Israel
                                conflict while maintaining with both sides a constructive

                                in the area. Specifically we should also bear in mind virtual
                                impossibility of keeping a military relationship with Israel secret
                                with foreseeable result that road would be opened for Soviet

                                    Declaration dealing with aggression would provide renewed
                                    assurance to both Israelis and Arabs as well as deterrent to
                                    both. We would envision (a) asking British and French not to
                                    join in our initiative and (b) quiet diplomacy rather than
                                    public statement.</p>
                                <p>New formulation of security guarantee specifically for Israel
                                    considered by conference to be both unnecessary and undesirable.

                                    impartial and is suitable to situation. A new version would
                                    raise serious questions of meaning and intent. Conference
                                    believes Arabs and Israelis clearly understand, <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0789"/>principally from precedent,

                                    previously existing vulnerability of Israel air defense somewhat
                                    increased by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> acquisition of

                                            in past. Israel’s own military defense capability is
                                            only one of several effective deterrents to Arab attack
                                            among which are fear of Israeli reprisal, fear of
                                            Western intervention on side of Israel, deep divisions
                                            among Arabs, and particularly on part of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> certain loss for

                                                during Presidential conversations improbable but
                                                process of continued discussion and perhaps
                                                negotiation might well be inaugurated, a notable
                                                advance over present situation. We are influenced in
                                                this direction by fact long-standing U.S. arms

                                                avoid onus for arms race and proliferation of

                                                relations with Arabs without jeopardizing Israel
                                                security. Once U.S. breaks barrier by selling Hawk
                                                to Israel U.S. would find it virtually impossible
                                                avoid sales further missiles, thereby contributing
                                                to [garble—escalation?] since provision of even
                                                defensive weapons inevitably leads to requirement
                                                for greater offensive capability and thus to a
                                                continuing spiral. Further, conference sees need to
                                                avoid creation of situations disruptive and erosive
                                                of U.S.-Arab relations additional to existing issues

                    <p>On June 16, 1962, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and
                        South Asian Affairs <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName> proposed in
                        a memorandum to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> that
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> send a memorandum to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> setting forth the
                        Department of State’s reasons for opposing efforts to obtain support for
                        direct negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors and authorizing
                        the Department to make its position clear to Israeli officials. <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName> noted that Israeli officials were
                        commencing a campaign to persuade the Department of State of the need to
                        support direct peace negotiations and that Israel’s supporters within the
                        United States had underway a drive to develop U.S. opinion favorable to some
                        kind of direct peace negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName> argued: “If we fail to oppose these pressures firmly
                        at the offset, they may present us with a major problem by fall when we will
                        have to engage in negotiations on sensitive Palestine matters at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> has expressed concern over
                        renewed Israeli activity to secure support for the direct peace talks
                        concept.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_NEAIAI1">NEA/IAI</gloss>

                    <p>A June 18 note to <persName corresp="#p_BWH2">Brubeck</persName> from
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>’s Special Assistant Emory C.
                        Swank, attached to <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName>’s June 16
                        memorandum, reads: “You will recall that the attached memorandum was the
                        subject of discussion at this morning’s staff meeting, with the Secretary
                        indicating concern that we not appear to oppose in principle direct peace
                        negotiations between the Arab countries and Israel. The Secretary penciled a
                        note referring this paper for action to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, but it was my impression at staff meeting that this
                        was a problem which the Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>
                        would interest himself in initially.” (Ibid.) The record of the June 18
                        Secretary’s staff meeting indicates that “The Secretary directed that in
                        discussion of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions for direct
                        negotiations between the Israelis and the Arabs we should avoid the posture
                        of opposing direct negotiations in principle.” He also “requested <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> to
                        prepare a study and recommendations for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> on the subject of direct Arab-Israel negotiations,
                        clearing with H—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName> with
                        regard to the statements we have made on the Hill.” (Ibid., Secretary’s
                        Staff Meetings: Lot 66 D 147)</p>
                    <p>On June 18, <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName> directed to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>’s attention a draft
                        letter to Senator Boggs, prepared in the Bureau of Near Eastern and South
                        Asian Affairs, that <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName> had found
                        on his desk after the Secretary’s staff meeting. <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName> noted in a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> that language in the proposed letter showing
                        Department of State resistance to direct Arab-Israeli negotiations was
                        typical of over 50 such letters that had gone out to members of Congress
                        within the previous 2 months. <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName>
                        then advised: “Both the Democratic leadership on the Hill and several
                        members of the White House staff have expressed considerable concern <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0792"/>over our posture on this issue. The
                        Jewish newspapers in the country in the last sixty days have made quite an
                        issue of this position. I have talked with <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>
                        several times about it. While the Arabs obviously will refuse to negotiate
                        directly with Israel, I personally believe our discouraging such talks
                        appears domestically to be taking the Arab viewpoint without in any way
                        lessening tensions in the Middle East. I would think that the U.S. would
                        always want to be in the position of encouraging efforts at understanding on
                        a bilateral as well as a multilateral basis.” (Attached to memorandum from
                            <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName>, June 18; ibid., Central Files,
                        684A.86B/6–1862)</p>
                    <p>In a separate memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName> on
                        June 18, <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName> indicated that he was
                        returning the proposed letter to Senator Boggs, adding “I assume that
                        language will be inserted indicating that this country supports negotiations
                        between the parties even though recognizing that Arab leaders would not
                        likely be willing to undertake direct talks.” <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName> then recalled several letters to members of Congress
                        that had not only reiterated U.S. opposition to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> General Assembly draft resolution of December 19, but went
                        considerably further in registering Department opposition. <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName> said that at <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>’s request, he had sent <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> copies of several of these letters.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName> also complained to
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName> that “we owe a letter to
                        Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FL4">Farbstein</persName> indicating that
                        assurances of a change in Jordanian policy previously given to him in
                        writing have not been borne out. I know that he and several Jewish
                        organizations have been deliberately testing the Jordanian regulations
                        through the Embassy here and can document the fact that our assurances did
                        not turn out in practice. The record should be set straight by us before it
                        is done in the Congressional Record by <persName corresp="#p_FL4">Farbstein</persName>. I realize that this involves a delicate matter
                        with Jordan; but considerable damage will be done to the Department and its
                        overall presentation of foreign policy matters if specific documentation is
                        produced that assurance has been given to the Congress on the matter when,
                        in fact, there is no basis for it as verified by travel applications made by
                        American Jews to the Jordanian Embassy.” A notation in an unidentified hand
                        next to the suggestion to send <persName corresp="#p_FL4">Farbstein</persName> a letter reads “No”. (Ibid.)</p>

                        <item><p>I lunched with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> at his request. He began by raising what he
                                described as a small technical question which he was sure could be
                                swept out of the way. This related to the use by <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> in a Security Council
                                discussion of the phrase, “area under Israeli control” to describe
                                the Sea of Galilee. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                                pointed out the difficulties this phrase caused for them. It is a
                                phrase with military connotations, and the Syrians felt that much of
                                the lake was under their effective control because of their gun
                                positions on the hills overlooking it. According to <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>, there is no dispute over the
                                proposition that the Israelis exercise jurisdiction and authority
                                over the lake under the armistice agreement, and that Syria was not
                                now riparian. Whether or not the U.S. recognized Israeli
                                “sovereignty” over the sea, we should and could recognize Israeli
                                authority and jurisdiction. It would be most helpful to them in the
                                future if the U.S. represented them in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by describing the situation in regularly accurate
                                terms.</p>
                            <p>There followed some general discussion about the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peace-keeping machinery and the
                                attitude of Israel toward the patrol boat in the Sea of Galilee. In
                                the course of this, I indicated that to the U.S. it sometimes seemed
                                that the Israelis were rather rigid in relation to the question of
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peace-keeping activity in the
                                area.</p></item>

                        <item><p>Most of the time was devoted to the question of the balance of
                                power, military and otherwise, in the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> indicated the Israeli concern
                                for growing Egyptian strength and for the continuing subversive
                                activities of the Egyptians in other Arab countries, and said that

                                possession of missiles was increasingly firm but was unclear as to
                                whether this went beyond the air-to-air missiles associated with the
                                    <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21.</p>
                            <p><persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> asked to what extent we

                                which I responded it was too soon to tell. He indicated his own
                                skepticism in this respect. When I asked him what alternative he had
                                to suggest, he didn’t answer, but said, “Remember, if you don’t
                                succeed, we will be facing those dogs.” <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0794"/>We talked about the military balance, and I assured
                                him that we were very much concerned to see that it was maintained.
                                He expressed a desire that there should be more consultation between
                                us in the future on this point.</p></item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>He then turned to the question of the impact of the Common Market on
                            Israel and discussed some of the problems involved. In the course of his
                            discussion, he mentioned the effect of the Suez blockade increasing
                            Israel’s economic difficulties. He agreed, in response to my comment,
                            that this is a problem which the U.S. could do little except by way of a
                            general pressure toward reducing the external challenge of the East.
                            However, even that general pressure would not solve Israel’s problem
                            because of the importance of a very few commodities in Israeli’s exports
                            which would be unaffected by the achievement of zero duties on our zero

                    <p>In your memorandum of June 10 (Tab A) you stated you still were not satisfied
                        that the materials submitted by <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> (Tab
                            B)<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn2">Not attached but printed as <ref target="#d290">Document 290</ref>.</note> came to a well supported
                        position on the Hawk missiles and posed the question: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Does Egypt have an important air strike capability against Israel
                                and, if so, does Israel have a sufficiently credible defense against
                                such air strikes as to provide reasonable security.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0795"/>
                    <p>With respect to the first part of the question, Egypt may now have, and is
                        certainly expected to have in the near future, an important air strike
                        capability against Israel. Egypt has some 8 TU–16 mid-range jet bombers and
                        46 Ilyushin-28 light jet bombers, with a considerable increase scheduled for
                        the coming year.</p>
                    <p>The second part of the question is far more difficult to answer, in large
                        part because of the widely different factors that enter into the equation
                        for determining whether there is a sufficiently credible defense as to
                        provide reasonable security. In a strictly air defense sense, Israel does
                        have considerable vulnerability to air attack. The recent Arab-Israel
                        Situation Report of June 7 (Tab C)<note n="3" xml:id="d299fn3">Not
                            attached.</note> states that the Israel air defense system has several
                        major weaknesses (page 18) since “capability to provide an effective defense
                        against a night or bad weather attack is poor because of a shortage of all
                        weather fighters. The radar network is vulnerable to jamming tactics and
                        also has difficulty detecting low-level penetrations.”</p>
                    <p>The report notes that the Israelis are taking measures, construction of
                        partially underground revetments, etc., to assist in meeting this problem.
                        We do not have a comprehensive Defense Department analysis of the full
                        extent to which Israel is vulnerable to air attack, nor do we have a careful
                        study of how far provision of Hawks would go in meeting this problem or how
                        it would shift the balance of military power between Israel and its
                        neighbors. We are asking for such an analysis.<note n="4" xml:id="d299fn4">In a June 20 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> (<gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>), <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName> requested that the Bureau of
                            Intelligence and Research obtain by June 28 “an estimate which would
                            provide us with a somewhat more refined analysis of Israel’s
                            vulnerability to air attack, the extent to which provision of Hawk
                            missiles to Israel would meet this problem, and how their availability
                            to Israel might be expected to shift the balance of military power
                            between Israel and its neighbors.” (Department of State, Central Files,
                            684A.86/6–2062) On June 25, in a letter to <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>), <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName> asked the Department of Defense
                            to provide a “more refined analysis of Israel’s vulnerability to air
                            attack. Particularly we would like to have an appraisal of the extent to
                            which provision of Hawk missiles to Israel would meet this problem and
                            whether their availability to Israel might be expected to shift the
                            balance of military power between Israel and its neighbors.”

                    <p>A credible defense posture, of course, turns on much more than air defense.
                        Israel has a superior fighter air force and a substantially superior army.

                        which I commend for your reading, of the consensus developed in extensive
                        discussions <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0796"/>during the <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> Ambassadors meeting in Athens on the subject
                        of the maintenance of peace in the Near East and, in this context, of the
                        security of Israel. The issue of providing Hawks to Israel was a major part
                        of their discussion.</p>
                    <p>The main problem as the conference saw it was the danger that if a serious
                        imbalance of vulnerability should develop it would create a real temptation
                        to pre-emptive attack. This, rather than whether there was a defense “gap”
                        on either side of the Arab-Israel quarrel, was seen as the central
                        problem.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Governor</hi>: After receiving your letter of June
                            14<note n="1" xml:id="d300fn1">Not found.</note> I decided to discuss
                        the “correspondence” again with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>. I told <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0797"/>him
                        that I felt his Government had an obligation to discuss with us, in advance,
                        any initiatives it considered taking at the United Nations which would
                        involve us. I referred specifically to the “Brazzaville” resolution.<note n="2" xml:id="d300fn2">Reference is to the draft <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> resolution defeated in the General Assembly’s
                            Political Committee on December 19 calling for direct negotiations
                            between Israel and its Arab neighbors. See <ref target="#d153fn3">footnote 3 Document 153</ref>.</note> It seemed to me, I said, that
                        if they expected understanding from the United States they should take the
                        United States into their confidence with regard to their plans.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> assured me that his
                        Government was not taking any action to enlist support for another
                        “Brazzaville” resolution. He assured me that if it seemed advisable to
                        introduce such a resolution his Government would consult with you before it
                        discussed the matter with the representatives of any other nation. I made it
                        clear that we would regard such a resolution at this time as an effort to
                        embarrass the United States, and he seemed to understand. At the conclusion
                        of this phase of our conversation I summarized by saying that, although we
                        could not expect to dictate the actions of his Government, we would expect
                        an opportunity to offer our advice before his Government became committed to
                        a course of action; and he agreed.</p>
                    <p>I then raised the question of Israeli cooperation with the United Nations in
                        connection with its peace-keeping operations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> pointed out that their interest in
                        not retaliating and in keeping peace and harmony was proved by their recent
                        actions: despite machine-gun fire against their farmers by one Arab State
                        and the shooting of four police officers (one of them fatally) who were
                        merely fixing a fence in Jerusalem, the Israeli Government had contented
                        itself with filing a complaint. He said that this represented Israeli
                        policy. I asked for more constructive suggestions concerning the part the
                        United Nations could play in maintaining peace, and he promised to give me a
                        memorandum on how his Government might cooperate in the strengthening of the
                        United Nations forces.</p>
                    <p>In addition, in accordance with your suggestion, I asked <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Harlan Cleveland</persName> to have a memorandum
                        prepared for you and me on how the Israelis can help to improve the
                        peace-keeping operations of the United Nations in the Near East.<note n="3" xml:id="d300fn3">Attached to the source text is a 2-page paper entitled,

                        naturally resent. I would appreciate it if you would review the matter and

                                had earlier agreed with the US not to supply such weapons to Israel
                                in advance of their supply to the Arabs by the Soviets. In any case,
                                the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> cannot be put in the position
                                of blocking its own firms from making such weapons while leaving the
                                commercial advantage to the US. On June 13 the Israel Ambassador in
                                London asked for basic information and advice regarding missiles.
                                There are growing signs of Soviet intentions to sell missiles to
                                Arab states. Thus the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> cannot now

                        for a further review of the situation in Iraq and of our policy.</p>
                    <p>We believe the course Iraq is now pursuing is deliberately designed to
                        frighten the West by appearing to take Iraq progressively closer to the
                        Soviet Bloc. This appearance is, of course, strengthened by the progressive
                        weakening of Iraq’s ties with the Free World countries. We believe, <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0801"/>however, that Iraqi leadership
                        probably can go on playing this kind of brinkmanship without losing control
                        to the Communists and that eventually anti-Qasim nationalist pressures will
                        become strong enough to force a change which will most likely produce
                        another strongly nationalistic government but one with a more balanced
                        foreign policy. The British share our view.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances we believe our course should be guided by a
                        determination to avoid fright or panic. We should continue to adhere to our
                        policy of maintaining, insofar as possible and under the handicaps imposed
                        upon us, normal relations with the Iraq government. In this way we will be
                        doing the most we can to slow, or hopefully to reverse, the present gradual
                        trend toward closer ties with the Bloc.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>’s memorandum of June 4
                            breaks down into two principal points: 1) what can we do to stop the
                            current trend toward the Soviet Bloc and 2) whether we are prepared to
                            move quickly in event of a change of regime, and how.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">A. The Iraqi Move toward the Bloc.
                                What do we do?</hi></p>
                        <p>We agree with Embassy Baghdad on the trend, on Qasim’s ebbing popularity,
                            and on his ultimate overthrow, whether soon or ten years hence.</p>
                        <p>Iraqi policy of appearing to move steadily in the direction of the bloc
                            is deliberately designed to frighten the West and the other Arabs into
                            letting Iraq gain control of Kuwait. Qasim’s determination to <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0802"/>proceed along this line is
                            encouraged by his deep anti-Western antipathies and by the attractive
                            credit arrangements by which he acquires assistance from the Bloc.
                            Moreover, the appearance of Qasim’s trend toward closer ties with the
                            Bloc is heightened, of course, by his worsened relations with the
                            Western countries exemplified in the recent lowering of the level of
                            diplomatic representation between the United States and Iraq. That Iraq
                            can be swayed from its policy by anything less than control of Kuwait or
                            an internal upheaval seems unlikely. However, in dealing with the Qasim
                            regime and to maximize the prospects for keeping Qasim and any successor
                            regime from moving more closely to the Bloc, we believe the West’s best
                            present posture is to show a continuing interest in pursuing normal
                            relations with Iraq but without appearing deeply perturbed at Iraq’s
                            brinkmanship. To exhibit serious concern would merely confirm to Iraqi
                            leadership that it is pursuing the course likely to lead to achievement
                            of its principal objective, control of Kuwait. For the United States to
                            maintain such a posture demands a high degree of sophistication and a
                            confidence that nationalism in Iraq remains strong and capable of
                            protecting Iraqi independence. We (and the British) continue to have
                            that confidence.</p>
                        <p>Since June 25, 1961 when Qasim entered Iraq’s renewed claim to Kuwait,
                            and from which date the reversal of a slow trend toward better relations
                            with the West occurred, we have engaged in a continuing effort to make
                            clear to the Iraqi Government our desire to have good relations and to
                            be as helpful as possible. We have undertaken lengthy and, hopefully,
                            successful efforts to work out a solution to the sticky problem of
                            standards for Iraqi dates exported to the United States. We have
                            regularly encouraged American businessmen to compete for business in
                            Iraq despite Iraqi favoritism for the Bloc. After lengthy consideration
                            within the United States Government, it has been decided to meet Iraq’s
                            request to purchase 500 military trucks in the United States. We have
                            avoided any open criticism of the Iraqi regime and have undertaken no
                            clandestine activity against it. We have as best we could continued
                            contacts with a range of Iraqi officials well disposed toward the West
                            and have met Iraqi requests for training assistance of various types.
                            Also we have been active in providing key officials with material which
                            makes clear not only the nature of the Soviet regime but also includes
                            statements tending to reflect on the Iraqi regime. We have consulted
                            regularly with the United Kingdom. We have encouraged West German
                            efforts in Iraq. We have pretty much kept out of the Iraq-<gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> problem but it is an important factor
                            in the equation. It seems unlikely that Qasim will go so far as to
                            permit control of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> operations to be
                            transferred from the Western companies to the Soviets or the Red
                            Chinese. <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> ability to shut down
                            operations and thus deprive Iraq of essential revenue is an ultimate
                            sanction which may give Qasim some pause and may <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0803"/>explain in part why the British
                            Ambassador is still in Baghdad. But resort to this sanction to topple
                            Qasim could well start a chain of events where we could not predict the
                            outcome would be an improvement over the present situation.</p>
                        <p>We attribute the improving Soviet position in Iraq less to Soviet skill
                            and sophistication than to deliberate Iraqi policy, a path being taken
                            despite considerable disenchantment with Soviet policy, with Soviet
                            practices and with the quality of Soviet performance and materials. The
                            answer has to come from within Iraq and the United States cannot hope
                            successfully to manipulate the internal forces at work. We propose to
                            maintain a dignified, friendly, rather regretful posture toward Iraq and
                            give its leadership no satisfaction in the form of believing it has the
                            United States Government flustered. The process of severing ties with
                            the West is likely to be long drawn out, for Qasim seems to be
                            considering the objective of controlling Kuwait as at least a
                            medium-term rather than as a short-term one. At the same time that the
                            Qasim regime moves closer to the Bloc, it displays no intention of
                            allowing the Communists to become dominant inside Iraq.</p>
                        <p>At present we prefer not to seek United Arab Republic views for this
                            would likely be utilized covertly by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to strengthen any existing impression in the Arab world
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is our chosen instrument
                            for dealing with Arab affairs. In our opinion, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in its own interest is likely to devote
                            increasing efforts to the destruction of the Qasim regime and the
                            establishment of a non-Communist successor, whether or not we consult or
                            encourage the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. At a later stage
                            there may be utility in consulting the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and we are bearing this in mind.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">B. Contingencies—Change of Regime in
                                Iraq</hi></p>
                        <p>Two of the attachments, our latest contingency paper (still valid) and a
                            recent British study, set forth our thinking and will not be duplicated
                            here. Suffice it to say we have very much in mind the desirability of
                            early recognition of a non-Communist successor regime (providing it
                            appears able to hold power) and of making clear in general terms our
                            desire to be helpful, leaving specifics to the new regime. We would urge
                            other Free World states to take similar action, particularly Turkey and
                            Iran. In event of a Communist takeover (unlikely), we would consult with
                            the British and with Iraq’s neighbors on courses which would remove the
                            regime before it could consolidate. Of the contingency courses of action
                            proposed by Embassy Baghdad, we believe that if Iraq needs ready cash,
                            it can be found promptly (but we would prefer to take no unusual steps
                            now to prepare the way); however, we have our doubts about the need for
                            or desirability of a major program with the police, would oppose use of
                            the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> label in dealing with Iraq,
                            and consider <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0804"/>impractical the
                            use of an inventory system for finding experts for future employment in
                            Iraq.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">C. Conclusion</hi></p>
                        <p>We believe the course Iraq is now pursuing is deliberately designed to
                            frighten the West by appearing to take Iraq progressively closer to the
                            Soviet Bloc. Yet it is notable that Iraqi leadership very carefully
                            maintains an internal balance of political forces designed to prevent
                            any one element, including the Communists, from becoming dominant. From
                            our observations of Iraqi policy and actions since Qasim came to power,
                            it has become clear that Iraqi leadership has the will and the probable
                            capability to play brinkmanship without losing control to the
                            Communists. We also think the anti-Qasim nationalist forces will become
                            more and more troubled as Qasim pursues his course which results in
                            isolating Iraq progressively from brother Arabs and from the Free World.
                            Eventually, in our opinion, unless the West makes serious mistakes, such
                            internal pressures will be created in Iraq as to force a change. That
                            change is estimated as most likely to produce another strongly
                            nationalistic government, but with a more balanced foreign policy. The
                            British, with whom we consult periodically, agree with our
                            assessment.</p>
                        <p>We are unhappy with Iraq’s present course and are doing what we can
                            within our limited capability to slow and hopefully reverse the present
                            gradual trend toward closer ties with the Bloc. Of basic importance is
                            the need to avoid fright or panic which would lead either 1) to placing
                            of pressures on Iraq and thus force Iraq to move more rapidly in the
                            direction we do not want it to go, or 2) to proving to Qasim the course
                            he has chosen is the correct one.</p>

                    <p>The article in the June 25 New Republic, “Courting <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>”, in which the President has
                        expressed an interest, is filled with distortions and <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0805"/>untruths. The policy it attacks is a
                        mockery of what in fact is our policy toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the Near East generally.</p>
                    <p>Contrary to assertions in the article, all Presidential correspondence with
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was fully staffed
                        throughout the government.<note n="1" xml:id="d304fn1">Attached but not

                        key figure in mid-eastern politics”. We consulted with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> with regard to the Syrian crisis but
                        certainly did not seek his “go-ahead” before recognizing the Syrian regime.
                        Our timing and tactics paid handsome dividends in preserving our relations
                        with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and getting us off on the right
                        foot with the new Syrian government.</p>
                    <p>United States assistance to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in food,
                        technical assistance and industrial loans has been tied closely to Embassy
                        Cairo’s recommendations although details of our recent loans in support of
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>-backed stabilization program were worked out here with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Minister of Economy. Our policies
                        have been based on careful appraisal of our national interests and not the
                        inspiration of any single individual. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s role in the Congo shifted to full support of the
                        Adoula government when he became convinced that it was an independent one.
                        We have no evidence of his playing a provocative role among the Mau-Mau
                        (dead as an organization for several years). The canard that he showed
                        willingness to deny the canal to Portuguese and Dutch ships in the Goan and
                        West Irian crises is based on wholly unsubstantiated press stories.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has gone in for
                        anti-Iranian propaganda but we are working on a plan whereby both the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Iran would cease simultaneously their
                        mutually hostile radio broadcasts.<note n="2" xml:id="d304fn2">Documentation

                    <p>We have not expected our policies to put <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> at the end of a short string or induce him to abandon
                        his neutralist policy nor to give up all ideas of a prominent role in the
                        Arab world. Our objectives are not in this context.</p>
                    <p>We have expected, however, a number of things which are occurring—increased
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> concentration on its internal
                        development with a growing inclination to leave aside touchy area problems,
                        or, as Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> has put
                        it, “place in the icebox” the Arab-Israel dispute. We have been gratified by
                        the consistent tapering off of anti-U.S. material in the Cairo press, by
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> endeavors to mend its fences with
                        the Western governments and by a gradual thaw in our whole range of contacts
                        with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> down through our political officers
                        in Cairo. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is developing a stake in
                        good relations with the United States and the West. The scope of the
                        dialogue between <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0806"/>us is expanding
                        and the fabric of our ties is being strengthened. We expect disagreements
                        may arise but we are convinced, too, that our present approach is gradually
                        expanding our influence in Cairo with a consistently moderating impact on
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s whole outlook.</p>
                    <p>Several of our Near Eastern Ambassadors reported at the recent conference in

                        be making <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> our “chosen
                        instrument”. But after full discussion our Ambassadors agreed that our
                        present course toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was the one
                        best calculated among available alternatives to serve the United States

                    <p rend="flushleft"><persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGB</persName>:</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Phil Talbot</persName> and I have agreed that he
                        will do a scenario tying together the various moves we contemplate on
                        Arab-Israeli policy. The idea would be to give JFK (and the rest of us) the
                        kind of comprehensive fill-in we all need. I also think President should
                        sign off personally on any such policy, and perhaps have a prior session
                        with the key actors on it.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile both State and Defense seem to favor selling Hawks to Israel as
                        soon as <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>starts actually getting the
                        various types of missiles <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                        contracted to give.</p>
                    <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0808"/>
                    <p>Before doing so, however, we ought to make an effort to sell mutual (though
                        tacit) arms limitations instead. This would involve an approach to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, probably at highest level, saying
                        “before we give Hawks to Israel to restore balance upset by your missile
                        purchases from Sovs, we’d like to see if both of you wouldn’t consider
                        cheaper and safer self-denial route.” I doubt <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would bite at this point, but at least we would have
                        explained to him in advance our plans to help Israel and hopefully make him
                        more cautious about further Soviet arms deal.</p>
                    <p>Above gambit may call for a high level approach to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, perhaps a JFK letter in response to
                        one <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> reportedly writing to
                        thank us for aid. But main effort would almost certainly have to be in
                        course of a <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit. State is
                        now thinking of proposing a <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben
                            Gurion</persName> visit in October or so, to be followed by Gamal.</p>

                    <p>1041. I combined first calls on Foreign Minister and Prime Minister with
                        presentation <persName corresp="#p_CHR1">Howard Cottam</persName> June
                        23.</p>
                    <p>In contrast with the general attitude of his predecessor, Aram gave the
                        impression of being a full participating member of the cabinet, interested
                        in budgetary and fiscal problems and explained drastic steps being taken by
                        government to cut budget and put public finances in order. While saying that
                        this was matter Prime Minister would discuss with me, he made plea for
                        budgetary help to cope with present situation. I made appropriate reply to
                        his representation. I was somewhat surprised that he did not raise question
                        of radio station or 2,000 special police force which he had previously done
                        with <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName>.</p>
                    <p>When I met Prime Minister he immediately launched into explanation of action
                        taken within recent past to reduce budgetary deficit and bring order into
                        fiscal picture. He said that some but not all Ministries <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0809"/>would be cut 15 per cent below last year.
                        In response to my inquiry he said that Ministry of Education would have the
                        same amount as last year and that the Ministry of Agriculture would be cut
                        15 per cent in its administrative expenses and that the cost of land reform
                        would be transferred to development budget. He said that for the purpose of
                        controlling expenditures the budget would be divided into four parts: (1)
                        hard core fixed expenditures such as salaries, and foreign obligations; (2)
                        those expenditures for which there was reasonable expectation that funds
                        would be available; (3) disbursement which would be authorized in the event
                        an increase in revenues over last year would permit; and (4) development
                        budget.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> was unable to furnish me figures as
                        to what the final budgetary deficit might be, saying that the figures were
                        being worked over by Samii, Under Secretary of Finance, as chairman of
                        pruning committee. In response to a question <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> said he would have final figures by June 30. Specific
                        statements made were that those development projects which had hitherto been
                        in ordinary budget and not in Plan Org would be transferred to the Plan Org
                        budget and that in compensation Plan Org would receive 60 per cent of oil
                        revenues instead of 55 per cent. Recalling that <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> share of oil revenues had been reduced last year from the
                        previous allotment of $20 million to $15 million, the <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said that he had an agreement with
                            <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> to reduce its budget this year to
                        $10 million.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> said that he was making every
                        effort to cut down military budget indicating that he had found a new
                        willingness on the part of the Shah to be cooperative in this respect, but
                        they found great difficulty in finding items which could be reduced. He
                        added that from Iranian resources he expected to give the military budget
                        the same amount as last year and this would leave a shortage represented by
                        the $15 million defense support which we had contributed. He then made a
                        strong plea for continuance of this assistance for the current year going
                        into a rather long attempt at justification based on internal-external
                        security, political stability, etc. To this I made a very firm and explicit
                        reply, reminding the <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> that I had
                        officially told him as well as the Shah many months ago when preparation of
                        the current budget was beginning, that they must not count on any budgetary
                        support from the U.S. in the future. I again went over the reasons why we
                        had adopted this policy and stated flatly that there were no funds available
                        for this purpose. Although <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> was
                        very clearly aware of our position, he was making a desperate try in a
                        belief, possibly shared by the Shah, that if we could be convinced of the
                        critical character of the existing situation, that it was worth a try to get
                        us to do one more rescue mission. I was as emphatic as I could be in
                        disabusing him of any hope in this connection. I also pointedly reminded
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> of the assurances he had
                        given me, at the time our <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0810"/>emergency
                        aid was given last year, concerning the establishment of a Budget Bureau, a
                        consolidated budget, tax reform, etc.<note n="1" xml:id="d307fn1">For

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said that in the military
                        budget there were items for the purchase of ambulances and spare parts which
                        he hoped might be supplied from U.S. sources and he asked me to direct
                        General <persName corresp="#p_HMGJC1">Hayden</persName> to examine these
                        items with the Ministry of War. I decided it was not appropriate at this
                        juncture to tell the <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> that as far
                        as ambulances and spare parts were concerned, the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program envisaged replacements. I told him I thought it was
                        entirely inappropriate for <persName corresp="#p_HMGJC1">Hayden</persName>
                        to become involved in determining the amount of the military budget; that
                        once the Ministry of War knew the amount of its appropriation, that it would
                        then be appropriate for the U.S. military advisor to be consulted on the
                        best use of these funds from a strictly military point of view.</p>
                    <p>It was abundantly clear that representations made by <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> expressing our concern about the
                        budget and lack of fiscal order and discipline had been hoisted in and that
                        the <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> was making great effort to
                        convince <persName corresp="#p_CHR1">Cottam</persName> and me that he was
                        tackling the problem with vigor and determination. We shall not be able to
                        judge results until final figures are known.</p>
                    <p>After some discussion <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> declared that
                        vigorous methods would be used to improve tax collection during current
                        fiscal year and that rates would be raised for the next fiscal year and
                        stated that austerity, improvement of administration, and improvement in the
                        economy of the country constitute a five-year program concurrently with the
                        third development plan. I made inquiry as to the Shah’s attitude toward the
                        measures contemplated now and for the future. <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> replied that he felt portion of the Shah’s agreement
                        [sic] and that as soon as the budget is ready for publication, he is going
                        to ask the Shah to make a statement to the nation that this is the direction
                        the country will follow for the next five years. The <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said that he wanted the country to
                        understand that this was the direction in which its salvation lies and that
                        this program will be sabotaged regardless of who is <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>. He wanted it to be the nation’s
                        program and not <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>’s program.
                        There was no suggestion here that <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> has any intention of leaving the government but rather
                        that he wanted a public reaffirmation of the Shah’s support of the program
                        which the latter had given in November.</p>
                    <p>Although he was not precise, <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName>
                        said that he plans to strengthen the Plan Org, particularly to reform or
                        eliminate its High Council. He also said that he had had Farmanfarmaian in
                        during the morning and that he was confident the latter would soon return to
                        duty.</p>
                    <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0811"/>
                    <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_AA10">Amini</persName> appeared tired and
                        harassed, I found him little different than when I had my last conversation
                        with him in early April. It may be that events will prove that he is a
                        “spent force” but it is very evident that he does not think so. I shall not
                        be able to give a considerate assessment of the situation here until I have
                        had an opportunity to explore it further and until I have had a conversation
                        with the Shah which I am requesting for early next week. I shall probably
                        not be able to offer any recommendations as to what we should do here until
                        after final budget figures are available for study.</p>

                            Minister Ben-Gurion to the President, dated June 24, 1962, was delivered
                            to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> at

                            page one, however, it lays unexpected stress on direct negotiations
                            between the Arab States and Israel. Additionally, it includes in the
                            final two pages a broad argument for more sympathetic United States

                        encouragement from the knowledge that people throughout the world and
                        certainly in Israel follow with admiration your courage and steadfastness in
                        the pursuit of peace, human advancement and freedom.</p>
                    <p>I would express to you my deep appreciation of the opportunity that was given
                        to my deputy in the Ministry of Defence, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Shimon Peres</persName>, <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0812"/>to
                        discuss with officials of your government matters of vital importance to
                        Israel’s security. Our Foreign Minister, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Golda Meir</persName>, examined these matters together with your
                        Ambassador on the seventh of June.<note n="2" xml:id="d308fn2">In telegram
                            853 from Tel Aviv, June 8, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName>
                            reported that during a meeting on June 7, which had been initiated by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> devoted practically the entire
                            conversation to speaking in behalf of Israel’s request for armaments,
                            particularly the Hawk missile. (Department of State, Central Files,
                            784A.5/6–862)</note> I was happy indeed to hear from you that these
                        matters are currently being carefully examined, and that the maintenance of
                        Israel’s integrity, independence and economic progress will continue to
                        engage your full support. I would express the hope that our governments will
                        remain in close touch in the examination of the specific matters referred
                        to.</p>
                    <p>Your letter is a renewed indication to me that on fundamental questions of
                        crucial significance for the future of our area our governments share an
                        identity of approach. The goal to which we seek to strive is that of lasting
                        and permanent peace and good neighbourliness between the Arab states and
                        Israel. In the effort to achieve this aim, it is indeed essential that
                        doctrines of belligerence be resisted, and direct negotiations for a
                        peaceful settlement be promoted and encouraged.</p>
                    <p>I fully share your hope that the quiescence on Israel’s borders will
                        continue. The policies of the Israel Government are consistently directed
                        toward this purpose. We have a vital interest in the preservation of this
                        quiescence. We are always ready to make our full contribution towards the
                        settlement of border disputes, their prevention and elimination. It is
                        clearly our interest not to see border incidents inflamed but rather to have
                        them speedily brought to an end.</p>
                    <p>I agree with you that the United Nations representatives on the spot could
                        play a helpful role by bringing their full influence to bear to prevent
                        shooting and other violations of the Armistice Agreement, and to be
                        instrumental in bringing the parties together to avoid incidents and prevent
                        them from attaining major proportions. We have seen some useful and workable
                        practices develop in relation to our borders with the Lebanon and Jordan. I
                        fully believe that a great deal can be learnt from these experiences in
                        relation to the Syrian border in particular. We shall always be ready to
                        cooperate with the United Nations representatives to this end.</p>
                    <p>In the spirit of this policy we have responded to the suggestions of the
                        United States Government to be informed of untoward incidents. We appreciate
                        the concern for the quiet of our borders implicit in this suggestion and the
                        good offices that the United States extend to this end.</p>
                    <p>I was gratified by your statement that Israel’s water project can and should
                        be carried out as scheduled, and I am deeply appreciative of <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0813"/>your support of our project. You have shown
                        by this statement a deep and sensitive understanding of one of Israel’s most
                        vital needs and interests. As you know, our two governments have been in
                        close and continuous association on this subject for many years. Our
                        attitude has always been clear. We do not wish to deprive our neighbours of
                        their rights; we plan to use our fair share of the water for the benefit of
                        our people. Accordingly, in the absence of an agreed unified development
                        plan, for which we are always ready and which no action on our part will
                        prejudice, we shall conform with the pattern of withdrawals and deliveries
                        of water on which the former United States Ambassador <persName>Eric
                            Johnston</persName> secured the technical agreement to which you refer.
                        I would hope that our two governments will maintain the closest contact on
                        the matter. As in the past, we shall always be ready to place our technical
                        experts at your disposal for detailed clarification of our plans. I fully
                        share your hope that there is no reason why all concerned should not proceed
                        in an atmosphere of calm and harmony to derive advantage for the benefit of
                        their peoples from waters which are now flowing to waste.</p>
                    <p>As you might know we have to shoulder tasks which do not exist in other
                        countries. We have to give a home to the newcomers. The figure of new
                        immigrants exceeds at present 10,000 per month. Most of them come from
                        backward and oppressed countries, where education was neglected for
                        centuries.</p>
                    <p>The transformation of these immigrants who lived in the most miserable Ghetto
                        conditions into tillers of the soil and into productive people in other
                        fields of endeavour; the transformation of the Negev, a desolate wilderness
                        which constitutes sixty percent of the total area of Israel, into a land of
                        fertility and habitation; the teaching of the Hebrew language to newcomers
                        from more than seventy countries and as many tongues; these are the tasks to
                        which we devote our efforts and energies.</p>
                    <p>Your great and rich country achieved this in the course of several hundred
                        years. We have to do this in the span of a short time.</p>
                    <p>Yet, above all we are confronted with a unique security problem. It is not
                        our democratic system, or our borders and independence alone which are
                        threatened, but our very physical existence is at stake. What was done to
                        six million of our brethren twenty years ago with the participation of
                        Palestinian Arab leaders, among them the ex-Grand Mufti and his henchmen,
                        could be done to the two million Jews of Israel, if, God forbid, the Israel
                        Defence Forces are defeated.</p>
                    <p>I am bound to say to my deep regret that such thoughts of total aggression
                        are not absent from the minds of some of the Arab rulers of our region. The
                        propaganda campaign which they conduct against us in Africa and in other
                        continents does not differ much from the ill-famed and ill-fated Nazi
                        propaganda.</p>
                    <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0814"/>
                    <p>For these reasons it is of utmost importance to provide the Israel Defence
                        Forces with sufficient deterrent strength which will prevent our neighbours
                        from making war on us. As long as the peace of the world is not secure
                        everywhere we have to secure our peace through our strength.</p>
                    <p>The situation in the Middle East in general is not particularly encouraging.
                        The principal failing of most of the countries of the area is the lack of a
                        democratic system of government, the inability of their peoples to achieve
                        untrammelled self-expression and the mastery over their own destinies. While
                        most of the Arab countries proclaim day in day out their aggressive designs
                        against Israel, we do not regard the Arab peoples as a target for hatred; to
                        us they are men and women like ourselves, who need and ought to get all
                        opportunities for education, health, development and social progress; and
                        like all other sections of the human race in our time, their fate depends
                        largely on peace, international cooperation, and mutual aid.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately such a state of mind and affairs does not prevail in the Arab
                        countries. In spite of the existence of the Arab League, there is no
                        positive and constructive cooperation between them; they are united in
                        nothing but their declared hostility to Israel. In none of them, except
                        Lebanon, is there even a hint of democracy; they all are ruled—directly or
                        indirectly—by the Military.</p>
                    <p>I am glad to note with deep satisfaction that two Moslem countries in the
                        Middle East, Turkey and Iran, whose combined population exceeds by far that
                        of our four Arab neighbours (Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon) maintain
                        good-neighbourly relations and cooperation with Israel for the benefit of
                        all involved.</p>
                    <p>I have confined myself on this occasion to comment mainly on the special
                        problems which you, Mr. President, raised in your letter. I shall be glad to
                        respond at an early opportunity to your suggestion to give an assessment of
                        the situation in other parts of the world as we see it from our vantage
                        point here.</p>
                    <p>In profound esteem,</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s letter (enclosed)
                        in our view represents a significant step forward in US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. For one thing, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s statement of sincere gratitude is
                        practically unique in the history of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        relations. More significant, though the letter is superficially simply an
                        expression of appreciation for the understanding shown toward Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> on the occasion of the latter’s
                        mission in Washington, we believe it may have substantive implications of
                        far-reaching import.</p>
                    <p>In the beginning of the message, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> implies that the attitude of the United States had a
                        bearing on the National Charter enunciated by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on May 21. Enclosed is the Department’s analysis of
                        that Charter<note n="2" xml:id="d309fn2">Attached but not printed.</note>
                        which (a) strikes hard at communism (albeit at capitalism as well); (b)
                        embodies finite moves toward decentralization of authority; (c) leaves the
                        door open to the development of a mixed economic and social system including
                        private foreign investment in limited fields; (d) advocates forward-looking
                        economic and social measures such as family planning and equality of women;
                        and (e) extends an olive branch to former imperialist countries who
                        participate in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s development
                        program. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has called himself
                        pragmatic and it may well be that he was influenced away from certain more
                        extreme views by the ideas presented to him in recent months by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MES2">Edward Mason</persName>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s message also implies that our
                        attitude toward the <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> mission
                        had an influence on the recent Casablanca Chiefs of State Conference which
                        was chiefly significant in respect of (a) support for the Evian agreements
                        on Algeria, (b) support only for “peaceful” moves by Morocco against
                        Mauritania, (c) call for effective control and supervision of
                        disarmament.</p>
                    <p>However, the key paragraph of the letter is <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reference to “mutual understanding” and an
                        expression of confidence that US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0816"/>differences can be kept “within
                        limits not to be exceeded”. We take this to mean that he intends to honor
                        his commitment to keep the Palestine question “in the refrigerator”
                        (provided of course that we also do so), to concentrate on modernization of
                        Egypt, to avoid overt provocative actions in the Middle East, and to pursue
                        a statesmanlike course in world affairs. He appears to wish to indicate that
                        he respects the role we are playing in the world and does not want to be far
                        out of step with it.</p>
                    <p>Inasmuch as this letter tends to balance previous messages sent to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>, we do not believe it calls for an
                        immediate reply. However, we desire to authorize Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> to comment favorably on the letter
                        in his next meeting with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.
                        Additionally, we plan, later in the summer, to consider recommending that
                        the President send <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> a letter
                        reviewing the state of our relations and suggesting means to keep momentum
                        behind their continuing improvement along the lines set forth in our

                    <p>Here’s the latest on US-Saudi relations in response to the President’s query.
                        In a nutshell, Saud has become increasingly surly since his visit because
                        he’s apprehensive over our attentions to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. State attributes his current behavior to childish
                        spitefulness over this one issue. <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> has tried to reassure him that our aid to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> implies no less interest in him.</p>
                    <p>We’ve been quite responsive to the requests Saud made during his visit: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The President promised to consider the possibility of economic
                                assistance. A three-man <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> survey

                            <item>The President promised to examine the possibility of providing
                                credit terms for a $16 million arms purchase. State has officially

                            <item>The President promised we would communicate our views on the
                                British role in Southern Arabia. State did so both here and in Jidda
                                in February. Saudis haven’t asked for anything further.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The President expressed willingness to continue the US Military
                                Training Mission but pointed out we would have to negotiate new
                                arrangements in view of our formal withdrawal from Dhahran Air Base
                                on 2 April. Negotiations are now going on, and training continues
                                under the old agreement.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>After considerable vagueness about what King wanted, Saudi
                                ambassador requested three 5 KW short-wave transmitters. Saud
                                originally confirmed this request. Now, however, he says they’re
                                unsuitable; he wants 50 KWs. State feels his change of mind results
                                from pique over our <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policy, not
                                from any change in technical requirements.</item>

                    <p>Saud has taken care of one of the two problems the President asked him about: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>He released from customs the backlog of equipment consigned to our
                                Consulate General in Dhahran and promised to expedite further
                                customs clearances.</item>

                            <item><persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> has not had a chance
                                to take up with him the matter of visas for American Jewish
                                travelers to Saudi Arabia, and Saud has offered nothing. In the
                                current climate, it doesn’t look as if we can hope for much progress
                                for the present.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Comparative figures on aid to Saudi Arabia and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> appear on the attached sheet. Chief financial difference
                        between the two is that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> for the past
                        year has been fighting a serious balance of payments problem and food
                        storage resulting from the last year’s crop disaster. In contrast, Saudis
                        since 1958 have improved their position to the point where, by late 1963, we
                        expect Saudi government will owe no money internally or externally.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName>’s preliminary findings confirm
                        State’s view that the Saudis don’t need substantial development assistance.
                        Saudi government gets about $375–400 million in annual oil revenues—about
                        80% of its total income. Although they have the makings of a fairly good
                        planning authority under a privately hired American, they probably won’t be
                        able to spend the $85 million set aside for development and normal
                        construction projects this year. Finance Minister told <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> he didn’t anticipate the need for
                        large-scale financial assistance for two years. However, he agreed with
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> that the real need is for
                        technical help. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> will bring his
                        detailed recommendations to Washington early in July, and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> will determine then what we might do.</p>

                        that United States assistance to the United Arab Republic was permitting

                        bloc.</p>
                    <p>The timing of the Israeli Embassy release of this information and the
                        Drummond article coincided with the Senate’s consideration of the Foreign
                        Assistance Act. The article was inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Congressional Record</hi> by Senator Keating of New York on June 7 when
                        he introduced the following amendment to the Senate version of the Foreign

                            <p>“Section 102 (b) Such section is further amended by inserting after
                                the seventh paragraph the following: ’it is the sense of Congress …
                                (phrase omitted) that requests for appropriations to carry out
                                programs of assistance under this Act should be accompanied by

                            <p>It is further the sense of Congress that in the administration of
                                these funds great attention and consideration should be given to
                                those countries which share the view of the United States on the
                                world crisis and which do not as a result of United States
                                assistance, divert their own economic resources to military or
                                propaganda efforts, supported by the Soviet Union or Communist

                    <p>Senator Keating made it clear in his remarks that the United Arab Republic
                        was one of the principal targets of his amendment.</p>
                    <p>The Department has been made aware by other sources that the Israel Embassy
                        has been active with other newspaper correspondents in propagating the same
                        line as with Mr. Drummond. Some of these sources are of the belief that the
                        Israel Embassy has been in contact with members of the Congress on the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>In our view such activity by the Israel Embassy is improper and is creating
                        serious embarrassment for the United States Government. Therefore we propose
                        to speak to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d312fn4">A July 3 note from <persName corresp="#p_BWH2">Brubeck</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>, attached to the source text, reads: “In reply to Mr.

                                identifying ourselves adequately with the aspirations of the peoples
                                for modernization and development, and preserving Western access to
                                oil reserves and lines of communication. In fact we can best promote
                                these interests in an atmosphere of relative tranquility.</p>
                            <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0823"/>
                            <p>To serve these interests we seek to demonstrate our respect and
                                support for the independence and sovereignty of each state; to
                                encourage orderly political, economic and social progress; and to
                                maintain a position of impartiality between the Arabs and Israel,
                                with due respect for the security and well-being of Israel. The road
                                to progress, however, is strewn with obstacles such as Arab
                                suspicions of the West, internal stresses arising from the
                                modernization processes, the Arab-Israel problem, and conflicts
                                among the Arab states themselves. The Soviets have established a
                                foothold in the Near East and no doubt will continue to look for
                                issues to exploit to our disadvantage.</p>
                            <p>In determining courses of action in the Near East we are constantly
                                concerned to reduce tensions. For example, we conduct our diplomacy
                                quietly and avoid public pronouncements; we avoid placing overt
                                pressures which would lead to counterpressures and reduction in our
                                influence; we have ceased interfering in the internal affairs of
                                Arab states and playing one group or state against another; we seek
                                to ameliorate various facets of the Arab-Israel problem; we have met
                                critical financial needs (<gloss target="#t_UAR1">U.A.R.</gloss>,
                                Syria, Jordan and Israel) which, unsatisfied, would have exacerbated
                                tensions; and, within the limits of our policy not to become a major
                                supplier of arms to disputants in the Palestine problem, we have
                                made available to Israel significant quantities of nonoffensive

                                        lead gradually to elimination of some of the inflammatory
                                        potential of the refugee problem and to reduction of the
                                        burden it imposes on the U.S. taxpayer. We are handicapped
                                        by strong emotions and inflexible attitudes on both sides.
                                        The Israelis are deeply apprehensive over the implications
                                        for their security of repatriation of any significant number
                                        of Palestine Arabs. (The United States has frequently
                                        assured the Israel Government that we would never support a
                                        refugee solution that could affect Israel’s security.) The
                                        Arab governments continue to assert the right of the
                                        refugees to return to their former homes and resist strongly
                                        any solution, such as that suggested by the <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName> report of <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0824"/>1959,<note n="1" xml:id="d314fn1">Proposals for Continuation of United

                                        contend, his mission is a positive token of United States

                                        problem. It is the first effort of this kind in several
                                        years and has been accepted tolerantly, though not
                                        enthusiastically, by both sides.</p>
                                    <p>Dr. Johnson has just completed another trip to the host

                                <item>Recent months have seen steadily increasing concern among both
                                    Arabs and Israelis at the implications of Israel’s proposed
                                    withdrawals from the Lake Tiberias-Jordan River waters’ system
                                    scheduled to commence within the next eighteen months to two
                                    years. On its side, Israel has feared Arab military or
                                    diplomatic action aimed at preventing water uses for which the
                                    Israelis have over the last several years erected costly and
                                    elaborate installations and which are urgently required for
                                    Israel’s agricultural and industrial growth. The Arabs see
                                    Israel about to commence diversion of waters much of which rise
                                    in Arab lands and in which, as riparians, they have a right to
                                    share. They feel Israel may well intend to withdraw quantities
                                    beyond its equitable share. The recent U.S. assurances with
                                    regard to Israel’s right to water withdrawals and reciprocal
                                    Israel assurances protecting Arab rights is, of course, aimed at
                                    preventing eruption of hostilities. In addition we are quietly
                                    encouraging the Arabs to proceed with the development of their
                                    share of the waters, by this means hoping to reduce some of the
                                    tensions in concentrating on a constructive facet.</item>

                                    of Lebanon as a focal point for area conflict and tensions. On
                                    December 31, 1961, an attempted military coup was crushed by
                                    loyal Lebanese forces but repercussions within Lebanon and
                                    surrounding countries have continued. To offset a deep Lebanese
                                    sense of insecurity and in response to Lebanese requests, U.S.
                                    officials, including the President, offered affirmations,
                                    without military commitment, of our support for Lebanon’s
                                    stability, independence and integrity. These assurances played
                                    an important role in returning Lebanese internal affairs to a
                                    more normal course.</item>

                                    retaliatory raid was brought before the Security Council, the
                                    U.S. stood, as it has in the past, for a firm reproof of this
                                    type of Israeli action. The Security Council’s unanimous
                                    acceptance, with but one abstention, of the U.S. resolution
                                    demonstrated once again the international community’s preference
                                    for use of United Nations mechanisms for settlement of area
                                    problems rather than a dangerous resort to escalating
                                    hostilities. Since then, the U.S. has impressed upon both Syria
                                    and Israel the urgent need for restraint in this tense area, and
                                    we propose to support United Nations efforts to improve the
                                    effectiveness of its machinery in the area.</item>

                            <p>Since the outbreak of the Arab-Israeli conflict in 1948, Saudi Arabia
                                has customarily declined to grant entry visas to persons of Jewish
                                faith whatever their nationality. The United States has taken every
                                appropriate opportunity to impress on the Saudi Arabian Government
                                our abhorrence of practices which discriminate against American
                                citizens on grounds of religious faith.</p>
                            <p>Saudi Arabia, which considers that a state of war still exists
                                between the Arab states and Israel, asserts its policy is prompted
                                by security considerations and is not intended to discriminate
                                against persons of Jewish faith but is intended to bar admittance to
                                Zionist supporters. Saudi Arabia’s exclusionist policy is stimulated
                                also by a strain of xenophobia which, while diluted in recent years
                                by increasing contact with the Western world, continues to be
                                present and tends to surround the whole process of obtaining a Saudi
                                visa with conditions and delays.</p>
                            <p>Over a period of years we have sought mitigation and eventual
                                reversal of the Saudi Arabian policy of excluding U.S. citizens of
                                the Jewish faith, as well as restrictions against Jewish-owned
                                commercial firms in the U.S. We have done so through our Ambassador
                                in Jidda, through the Saudi Ambassador in Washington and through
                                direct Presidential intervention with the King during the latter’s
                                recent visit to Washington. We have repeatedly emphasized that
                                discriminatory practices against American citizens on grounds of
                                race, creed or color—whatever the reasons—are repugnant to the
                                fundamental principles on which this country was founded.</p>
                            <p>We have proposed to the Saudi Arabians that as a first step they
                                should shift their policies by certain modifications: (1) the
                                issuance of visas to U.S. Congressmen of any faith and (2)
                                permission for American citizens of Jewish faith to transit Dhahran
                                airport. During the King’s visit the President suggested these
                                modifications and reminded him that Saudi Arabia’s position on this
                                matter is more extreme than that of <pb n="767" xml:id="pg_767" facs="0827"/>any other Arab country, including the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, which imposes no restrictions on
                                the entry of persons of the Jewish faith. While restating the Saudi
                                position that only Zionists are refused entry into Saudi Arabia, the
                                King agreed to explore the possibility of bringing Saudi policy at
                                least into line with the more moderate visa-issuance policies of
                                other Arab states. The King requested that upon his return to Saudi
                                Arabia our Ambassador should deal with him directly on the matter.
                                We so apprised our Ambassador and requested that he take every
                                suitable opportunity to press the King further. Since the King’s
                                return to Saudi Arabia in late March, urgent operational problems
                                have had to take precedence in the talks our Ambassador has had with
                                the King. In addition the decline in the King’s health plus
                                necessary absences of our Ambassador from Saudi Arabia reduced
                                opportunities for contacts, and for the past month the King has been
                                away from Saudi Arabia for reasons of health.</p>
                            <p>During Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>’s meeting in Athens in mid-June with Near
                                Eastern Ambassadors, he discussed with them in depth the problem of
                                discrimination and with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> in a private conversation he stressed the
                                importance of this issue in the conduct of our policy. The
                                Ambassadors in general and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> in particular understand fully the significance
                                of the problem. The latter proposes to seek an early opportunity to
                                take up the matter shortly after the King’s return, but he frankly
                                expressed the view that, given the internal policies of the kingdom
                                plus the current Saudi attitude toward the U.S., he could not be
                                sanguine of early favorable action by the King. In his view,
                                progress can come only slowly with persistent action on his part. He
                                did point out that under the lead of the Royal Family liberalization
                                is slowly coming in Saudi Arabia, citing the fact that Christian
                                worship is now occurring in Dhahran and Jidda on United
                                States-controlled premises, something that could not have occurred a
                                few years ago. In addition, girls’ schools are now operating under
                                the sponsorship of members of the Royal Family, equally impossible a
                                few years ago.</p>
                            <p>We are convinced that successful amelioration of Saudi Arabia’s
                                exclusionist policy can only come about through quiet and persuasive
                                diplomacy and that attempts at undue pressure on our part might well
                                inhibit prospects for making progress in this matter and even
                                jeopardize our relations with a country whose interests and
                                orientation coincide in many respects with our own. We have been
                                guided accordingly in seeking to assist Congressman Halpern to
                                obtain a visa for Saudi Arabia. Without publicity we have on his
                                behalf approached the Saudi authorities at all levels, including the
                                King (before his White House visit), but as yet to no avail. We have
                                informed the Congressman of our continuing efforts and have
                                expressed the view that, while we are vexed by the Saudi inaction,
                                little would be gained, and perhaps much lost, by public
                                recrimination.</p></item>

                            <p>In 1959, while Syria was part of the United Arab Republic, the United
                                States took advantage of the fact that it was the policy of the
                                Egyptian region not to discriminate against travelers of Jewish
                                faith, to urge that a similar policy be followed in Syria. Our
                                representations were received favorably by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Central Government, but
                                implementation was not immediate because of the considerable local
                                autonomy maintained by the Government of the Syrian Region which
                                held that admission of persons of the Jewish faith created a
                                security problem for Syria in view of the strong feelings of the
                                populace concerning the Palestine problem. The American Embassy in
                                Cairo, nevertheless, continued to pursue the matter and was greatly
                                assisted in its endeavors by Egyptian and Syrian officials
                                responsible for tourism who wanted to increase the income earned by
                                the Syrian region in this field. Eventually in 1960 the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Foreign Office was able to give us
                                assurances that Jewish travelers would be welcome in the Syrian
                                region provided they arrived in organized tourist groups. Since the
                                secession of Syria from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> we
                                know of no change in this policy, nor have any complaints been
                                brought to the Department’s attention.</p></item>

                            <p>Our strenuous efforts with Jordan over many months finally resulted
                                in late April in the removal from its visa application forms of the
                                requirement for a baptismal certificate. However, shortly thereafter
                                we learned that the requirement was replaced by one asking the
                                religion of the applicant and that applications by persons of the
                                Jewish faith were to be referred to Amman for decision. Further
                                representations have been made to the Jordanian government and to
                                the Jordanian Ambassador here, so far without result.</p>
                            <p>In Athens recently Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> discussed the problem with Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName>, who is fully
                                conversant with its implications for U.S. policy. The Ambassador
                                stated he had warned high Jordanian officials that following his
                                return from the Athens conference, he intended to exert serious
                                pressure on them to relax their discriminatory practices and to
                                grant the Jordanian Ambassador in Washington considerable latitude
                                in issuance of visas to American Jews. On June 26 Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> reported a
                                series of conversations he has now had with the Prime Minister and
                                Foreign Minister. The former agreed that the Ambassador could assure
                                the Secretary of State that within one month a way would be found to
                                liberalize the issuance of Jordanian visas in Washington. Whether
                                there is performance remains to be seen.</p>
                            <pb n="769" xml:id="pg_769" facs="0829"/>
                            <p>Actually, with few exceptions we have found the Jordanian government
                                willing to waive its restrictive requirements in the case of
                                individuals who secured the Department’s intervention. Thus,
                                exceptions have been made to allow entry of individuals whose
                                passports bore Israeli stamps. In other cases, Americans of Jewish
                                faith or Americans known to be friendly to Zionist organizations
                                were permitted to come to Jordan again after U.S. official
                                representations.</p>
                            <p>The United States Government will continue to make all approaches it
                                can appropriately initiate with a view to further relaxations of
                                Jordanian restrictive practices as they relate to the travel of

                            against Israel is ibid., 484A.8612, 486.1112, and 486.84A2.</note></p>
                    <p>The Arab boycott stems from the Arab-Israel conflict and is designed by the
                        Arabs to reduce the economic and hence the military potential of Israel. The
                        causal relationship between the boycott and the Arab-Israel dispute tends to
                        give the boycott all the emotional intensity and complexity of its
                        underlying stimulus.</p>
                    <p>Over the years U.S. policy toward the boycott has been made clear: the United
                        States does not recognize or condone the boycott and has consistently
                        refused to facilitate its application. Our posts abroad are under standing
                        instructions to reiterate this fundamental position on every appropriate
                        occasion. For example, in July of 1961 the Department protested vigorously
                        to the Government of Kuwait the latter’s sending to a number of American
                        firms letters requesting compliance with boycott regulations under threat of
                        blacklisting for noncompliance. The despatch of these letters by Kuwait now
                        appears to have ceased. Furthermore, the Department stands ready to protest
                        individual boycott actions which are harmful to American firms. In point of
                        fact, however, we have received few requests for protests from firms
                        affected by the boycott. American firms have generally wished to resolve
                        their difficulties with Arab boycott offices in a manner which will attract
                        the least publicity and in light of their own decision as to where their
                        commercial interests lie. In several cases when we have offered to protest,
                        the American firms have not taken advantage of the Department’s offer.
                        Whereas the regulations for the boycott have been laid down by the Arab
                        League, their application is left to the individual Arab states. Here
                        practice varies widely and in some Arab countries the boycott has no
                        practical effect on American firms. In others pragmatic considerations play
                        an important part and the usual boycott procedures may be set aside in favor
                        of the countries’ own self-interest.</p>
                    <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0830"/>
                    <p>Arab boycott regulations do not involve religious discrimination and thus
                        Arab firms are neither prohibited nor do most of them refrain from doing
                        business with Jewish-owned firms. The boycott does include a primary boycott
                        under which all trade and financial transactions between the Arab countries
                        and Israel are prohibited and a secondary boycott in which firms or
                        individuals who maintain particularly close business ties with Israel or who
                        contribute to Israel causes are blacklisted. In the latter case, these firms
                        or individuals are denied the right to trade with the Arab countries. Mere
                        sale of goods by a non-Arab firm to Israel is not a cause for blacklisting.
                        The boycott also prohibits an airline or shipping line from establishing
                        regular passenger or freight services between Israel and Arab countries.
                        However, shipping and airlines, TWA for example, may serve both Israel and
                        an Arab country in separate runs. With the exception of tourist ships,
                        maritime transportation is prohibited from calling at an Israel and an Arab
                        port on the same trip. Mere calling at an Israel port is not, however,
                        grounds for blacklisting a vessel. Vessels carrying munitions to Israel will
                        be blacklisted. Blacklisting does not bar ships from the Suez Canal although
                        it does prevent vessels from receiving bunkering and other services in Suez
                        Canal ports. (Thus no American vessel has been denied use of the Suez
                        Canal.)</p>
                    <p>Several years ago a form used by a Saudi Arabian lawyer in connection with
                        the registration of foreign trademarks in that country required the
                        applicant firm to certify that it was not Jewish controlled or owned. This
                        document has been referred to as the creed-sworn declaration. It is not
                        clear whether this declaration followed a format laid down by the Saudi
                        Arabian Government or whether it was merely the lawyer’s interpretation of
                        what was required. In any event, it went beyond Arab League boycott
                        regulations. Subsequent to 1956, when this matter came to the attention of
                        ranking Department officers, the Department has refused to provide
                        authentication services in connection with any declarations which gave
                        evidence of racial or religious discrimination. As a result of this
                        decision, a number of American firms were unable to register their
                        trademarks in Saudi Arabia. The Department made a series of representations
                        to the Saudi Government regarding this matter and in the latter part of 1960
                        the creed-sworn declaration was withdrawn from use. No other instances of
                        Arab governments applying the boycott on racial or religious grounds have
                        come to the Department’s attention in recent years.</p>
                    <p>There have been a few cases in which an Arab firm has unilaterally decided
                        not to do business with Jewish-owned firms. Such decisions, however, have
                        not appeared to be based on the policies of the Arab governments nor on the
                        rules and regulations of the boycott.</p>
                    <p>For example, in 1961, the Department of Commerce publicized to the American
                        business community the interest of a Jordanian firm in <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771" facs="0831"/>securing bids for processed cheese. A West
                        Coast publishing firm telegraphed the Jordanian firm asking if it was
                        interested in bids from three cheese manufacturers, two of whom were stated
                        to be Jewish. The Jordanian firm asked that the non-Jewish firm submit a
                        bid. This case was brought to the attention of the Department by the
                        publishing house. Our Ambassador in Amman, under instructions from the
                        Department, raised the matter with the Jordanian Prime Minister who
                        expressed strong disapproval of the discriminatory attitude of the Jordanian
                        firm.</p>
                    <p>Recently the Department has discussed with representatives of the Monsanto
                        Chemical Company a threat of boycott against it in reprisal for its plan to
                        construct through one of its subsidiaries a plant in Israel for Israeli
                        account. The company desired that the Department take no action on its
                        behalf, considering (a) that its interests in Israel outweigh those in the
                        Arab world and (b) that it has certain means of continuing to do business in
                        the Arab countries even if placed on the boycott list. In addition, in
                        response to our approach to Minister of Economy <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> regarding a warning to Hilton Hotels to stop its
                        construction of a hotel in Israel or face loss of its contract for operation
                        of the Nile Hilton, the Minister has assured us that no action will be taken
                        against Hilton (the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> values highly the
                        tourist dollar).</p>
                    <p>Neither the Department of State nor the Department of Commerce disseminates
                        business opportunities in the Arab states where there is evidence of
                        discrimination on racial or religious grounds. If this element is not
                        present, however, business opportunities in the Arab countries are
                        publicized.</p>
                    <p>No department or agency of the United States Government has sanctioned or
                        approved any contractual language of a discriminatory nature in ship
                        charters nor any language barring American flag vessels touching at Israel
                        ports from carrying gifts of American surplus agricultural commodities to
                        Arab countries under Titles II and III of Public Law 480. In the case of
                        Title I shipments under Public Law 480, countries making these purchases
                        take delivery at dockside and negotiate shipping arrangements themselves
                        directly with the private carriers. Restrictive clauses in ship charters
                        negotiated by the United Arab Republic have included a prohibition against
                        sailing in Israeli waters prior to discharge. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> authorities assert this is not a boycott provision but is
                        inserted as a precaution in view of the continuing tension in the area. The
                        Israeli Government has included clauses in its Title I Public Law 480
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWI1">cargo</persName> charter contracts which
                        similarly forbid transporting vessels to sail in Arab waters or call at Arab
                        ports prior to discharge.</p>
