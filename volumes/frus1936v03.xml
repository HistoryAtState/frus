                                1935,<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">Not printed.</note> reporting that
                            the Afghan Minister at Paris had handed a note to the Embassy omitting
                            the guarantee of immediate and unconditional most-favored-nation
                            treatment in the proposed commercial agreement between the United States
                            and Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to inform the Afghan Minister at Paris that this
                            Government appreciates the sincere efforts of the Government of
                            Afghanistan to arrive at a common understanding with respect to a
                            commercial agreement. It is with deep regret that this Government finds
                            that circumstances do not permit the Afghan Government to enter into an
                            agreement providing for unconditional most-favored-nation treatment. The
                            Government of the United States is so firmly committed to this principle
                            as a basis of commercial relations that it cannot deviate from it.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that you advise the Afghan Minister verbally that Afghan
                            goods entering the United States are, in fact, treated on a plane of
                            equality with the goods of the most favored nation, and this Government
                            understands that American goods are similarly treated in Afghanistan.
                            You may further advise the Minister that so long as American goods
                            continue to enjoy most-favored-nation treatment in Afghanistan, similar
                            treatment will continue to be extended to Afghan goods in the United
                            States. You may point out that in the circumstances there would appear
                            to be no prejudice to the commercial relations between the United States
                            and Afghanistan notwithstanding that it has not been found possible to
                            conclude a formal understanding on this point.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0067"/>
                        <p>As regards the possible continuance of negotiations, as suggested by the
                            Afghan Minister, it may be observed that, although the elimination of
                            the unconditional most-favored-nation clause from the agreement greatly
                            lessens the interest of this Government in such an accord as might be
                            reached on other matters, it is realized that the Afghans might regard
                            even a very formalistic agreement as desirable and view a complete
                            breakdown of negotiations with disappointment. You are authorized,
                            therefore, in conveying the content of the preceding section of this
                            instruction to the Afghan Minister to suggest that, despite failure to
                            arrive at a complete accord, we should be prepared to give favorable
                            consideration to an agreement relating to friendship and diplomatic and
                            consular representation, which as a matter of fact appear to have been
                            the two points in which the Afghans were particularly interested at the
                            outset. The Department would emphasize in this connection the
                            desirability of assuring yourself informally that such an agreement
                            would be acceptable before proposing it formally.</p>
                        <p>You will note that juridical protection is not mentioned as a matter upon
                            which this Government suggests further negotiation. For your
                            confidential information in this connection it may be observed that this
                            omission has been made in view of the interpretation which might be
                            placed on that part of Article III<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">The
                                articles refer to the original draft agreement submitted as an
                                enclosure to Department’s instruction No. 692, January 2, 1935, <ref

                                    556</ref>.</note> which prescribes that Afghan subjects in this
                            country shall “be received and treated in accordance with the
                            requirements and practices of generally recognized international law”
                            and “shall not be treated in regard to their persons, property, rights
                            and interests, in any manner less favorable than the nationals of any
                            other country”. The point at issue here is that Afghans are ineligible
                            for American citizenship and under the provisions of Section 13 (<hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi>) of the Immigration Act of 1924<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d1fn5">43 Stat. 162.</note> may not be granted visas except
                            in certain specific cases. Although the right of this country to
                            prescribe such restrictions by the exercise of the right of sovereignty
                            could not be questioned, it would seem that an agreement based
                            unqualifiedly on the principles of international law and
                            most-favored-nation treatment would hardly be held to be compatible with
                            discriminatory restrictions on the nationals of one of the contracting
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>The immigration angle of this situation would appear to have been covered
                            adequately by Article IV<note n="6" xml:id="d1fn6">Reference should be
                                to article V of the original draft.</note> which provided that the
                            agreement should not affect existing statutes in either country
                            regarding immigration. No comparable reservation was made, however,
                            regarding <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0068"/>possible restrictions to
                            which Afghans in this country might be subject as a result of their
                            ineligibility to American citizenship, such as, for example, limitations
                            on the holding of property which prevail in certain states. It is
                            obvious, of course, that this problem may be largely theoretical but, on
                            the other hand, the Department would not want to be placed in the
                            position of seeming to grant, even by implication, a right to Afghans
                            not enjoyed by other persons ineligible to citizenship.</p>
                        <p>It has been suggested that Article III might be modified so as to
                            eliminate the possible danger of such misinterpretation by employing
                            some such wording as the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Subjects of His Majesty …<note n="7" xml:id="d1fn7">Omissions
                                        indicated in the original.</note> and nationals of the
                                    United States … shall receive the most constant protection and
                                    security of their persons and property.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The only objection to such a revision of the article in question is that
                            the Afghans would almost surely desire to be informed why such a change
                            was being made after they had agreed to accept the text originally
                            proposed by us. This in turn would lead almost inevitably to the
                            introduction of the ineligibility question, which for obvious reasons it
                            would seem desirable to avoid.</p>
                        <p>An additional argument that might be presented to the Afghan
                            representative in favor of dropping Article III of the proposed
                            agreement is the following one. That article provides for
                            most-favored-nation treatment with regard to the treatment of the
                            nationals of each contracting party in the territory of the other. You
                            could state that since Afghanistan is unable to proceed with respect to
                            most-favored-nation treatment in customs matters it appears to your
                            Government desirable to omit all reference to such treatment in regard
                            to nationals other than consular officers. On the whole the Department
                            is of the opinion that it would probably be preferable to endeavor to
                            have the Afghan Government forego Article III rather than to endeavor to
                            explain to it why it should have to be altered. However, should your
                            discussion of this matter with the Afghan Minister lead you to a
                            contrary opinion, the Department would be willing to include a revised
                            Article III in the proposed agreement. The Department encloses a
                            proposed draft agreement<note n="8" xml:id="d1fn8">Revised draft not

                            <p>The Afghan Chargé d’Affaires called this morning by appointment and I
                                handed to him the text of the “Agreement between the United States
                                of America and the Kingdom of Afghanistan in regard to Friendship,
                                Diplomatic and Consular Representation” in accordance with the
                                Department’s Instruction No. 1198 of February 13, 1936.</p>
                            <p>I told him that my Government had given a most serious study to the
                                questions that the negotiations had thus far raised and had come to
                                the decision that the sole way of bringing about some form of
                                agreement, so desirable for the foundation of good relations between
                                our two countries, seemed to be the omission of all controversial
                                articles where the mention of most-favored-nation treatment had been
                                included in the original drafts.</p>
                            <p>The Chargé d’Affaires was in thorough agreement and read through the
                                French text as proposed.</p>
                            <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0070"/>
                            <p>I pointed out to him that there were no textual changes as compared
                                with the articles on the same subjects in the text which had
                                previously been discussed. In other words: the text now before him
                                had been approved, the only changes being in the numbering of the
                                articles, due to the omission of the articles with reference to
                                most-favored-nation treatment.</p>
                            <p>He said that he would immediately bring the matter before his
                                Government. He said that unfortunately his Minister was on leave in
                                Afghanistan and would not be back before the month of June.</p>
                            <p>I replied that I regretted that very much as the Senate of the United
                                States would probably be on vacation at that time and due to the
                                activities of the presidential campaign would not in all probability
                                meet until late in the fall and therefore ratification by it, which
                                he realized was a necessary procedure, would have to be put off, and
                                that the matter, which had thus far been of long duration, would be
                                still further delayed, and that I hoped he would put this up to his
                                Government. I added that it might be possible for him to obtain full
                                powers for signature, or if that was impossible, perhaps one of the
                                Afghan Ministers in Europe could come to Paris for that purpose as
                                Mr. Straus was already furnished with full powers. I added that in
                                any case we would like an answer in principle as soon as possible as
                                to whether this text was acceptable.</p>
                            <p>As he did not raise the question, I did not mention anything whatever
                                with regard to the optional article, (No. III in the Department’s
                                Instruction), but numbered the Articles I to IV in accordance with
                                the attached text.<note n="11" xml:id="d2fn11">Not printed; it was
                                    the same as the final text of the agreement except for a few
                                    minor changes in the last article.</note></p>
                            <p>When the Chargé d’Affaires left, he thanked me very much for the
                                efforts made to attain an agreement and to get around the
                                difficulties presented by their national point of view, and
                                expressed every hope of success of obtaining consent to the
                                signature of the present Agreement.</p>

                                Youssef.</note> called to inquire as to the prospects of a trade
                            agreement with Egypt, and I explained that the situation had not changed
                            particularly since I last talked with him. I repeated what I had said to
                            him some months ago, that we were desirous of completing a number of the
                            agreements now pending before considering additional countries. I said
                            that we were interested in agreements with all countries but that we
                            could not take up actively the matter of a trade agreement with Egypt at
                            the moment although this did not indicate any lack of interest on our
                            part in the matter.</p>
                        <p>He was rather insistent in pressing for some indication of when the
                            matter might be taken up and I stated that this would depend a good deal
                            on our success in closing pending agreements and on our appraisal of the
                            general agricultural situation when that has been done. He inquired
                            about the Spanish agreement and I told him that it was not yet ready for
                            signature though we were hoping for fairly early consummation.</p>

                        <p>The Egyptian Minister called on Mr. Sayre<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2"
                                >Francis B. Sayre, Assistant Secretary of State.</note> today and
                            said that he was interested in furthering the idea of closer commercial
                            and agricultural relations between the two countries. As evidence of the
                            interest of the Egyptian Government in the growth of commercial
                            relations he pointed out that at the time of his appointment as Egyptian
                            Minister the King of Egypt had issued a statement favoring an increase
                            in such relations. Soon thereafter the then Prime Minister, Nessim
                            Pasha, had granted an interview to the United Press <pb n="9"
                                xml:id="pg_9" facs="0074"/>further elaborating upon this idea. Now,
                            the Minister stated, his Government was showing a further interest by
                            appointing to Washington an Agricultural Attaché who had arrived
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>The Minister pointed out that up to the present all of these gestures
                            have come from the Egyptian side and he stated that he was afraid,
                            unless the American Government responded in kind, that the Egyptians
                            might feel their advances were being repulsed. He thereupon intimated
                            that a public statement expressing the interest of this Government in
                            increasing its commercial relations with Egypt would be most encouraging
                            to the Egyptian Government and people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sayre pointed out that it was contrary to our practice to issue such
                            statements and furthermore it was essential to bear in mind that the
                            issuance of such a statement at the present time might hinder rather
                            than help accomplish the purposes which both he and the Minister had in
                            mind. In this connection Mr. Sayre stated that it was most essential to
                            avoid giving any impression that a trade agreement with Egypt was likely
                            of accomplishment in the near future since it was apparent that such an
                            agreement was out of the question during the next few months. Mr. Sayre
                            added that he did not wish either the Egyptian Government or people or
                            the American people to gain a contrary impression.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then stated that he proposed to write a letter to the
                            Secretary informing him of the appointment of an Agricultural Attaché
                            and reviewing the various statements referred to above which had been
                            issued by Egyptian officials. He said it would be most helpful and
                            encouraging if in reply the Secretary could express his own interest in
                            furthering American-Egyptian trade. Mr. Sayre assured the Minister that
                            the Department would be pleased to have his views in this matter and
                            that consideration would be given to preparing an appropriate answer. In
                            reply to a query of the Minister as to whether the American Legation in
                            Cairo could not express its interest in furthering American-Egyptian
                            commercial relations, Mr. Sayre pointed out that this would be
                            impossible since if such action were taken in one case it would be
                            necessary to take similar steps with reference to numerous other
                            countries.</p>

                            considering since its receipt your instruction No. 155 of March 11th,

                            far-sighted manner the principles fundamental to the normal restoration
                            of the international finance and commerce of the world.</p>
                        <p>I did not immediately make known your views to the Egyptian Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs because I had some doubt whether, in view of the
                            particular situation obtaining locally, it would not be wiser to defer
                            their presentation to the Egyptian authorities at this particular
                            time.</p>
                        <p>In consequence of the death of the King, the elections and the imminence
                            of a change of cabinet when your instruction was received, I thought in
                            any case that it would be a better plan to defer the presentation of the
                            general purposes of our Government as outlined in your memorandum until
                            a new cabinet was formed. The more I have considered this, however, now
                            that a new cabinet is in office with prospects of a long tenure, the
                            more persuaded I am that I should communicate with you and present my
                            point of view before proceeding further in the matter with the Egyptian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware the economic policies pursued by Egypt are to a certain
                            extent influenced by Great Britain and this has been particularly
                            evidenced in the large number of measures which have been adopted by the
                            Egyptian Government on the basis of suggestions made by interested
                            British authorities to the Egyptian Economic Mission which visited Great
                            Britain in 1935. By reason of Great Britain’s special position in Egypt
                            this country is unable to pursue a wholly independent international
                            economic policy.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, from my conversations with you when on leave in 1934 and in
                            1935 and from my conversations and communications with the Near East
                            Division I have gathered that the Department is not disposed to
                            encourage Egypt at this time in the conclusion of a trade agreement with
                            the United States. I understand that this attitude is taken for the
                            reason that there are no comparable advantages which Egypt would be able
                            to offer us in return for the reduction of the duty on long staple
                            cotton which forms the chief item of Egyptian exports to the United
                            States and is, as you know, the principal source of Egyptian wealth.</p>
                        <p>The copy of a memorandum, forwarded with despatch No. 147 under date of
                            December 27, 1935,<note n="4" xml:id="d8fn4">Not printed.</note> setting
                            forth a conversation held on December 12th, 1935, between the Egyptian
                            Minister and the Assistant Chief of the Division of Trade
                                Agreements<note n="5" xml:id="d8fn5">Henry L. Deimel, Jr.</note>
                            regarding the <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0076"/>negotiation of a
                            trade agreement between the United States and Egypt, was interpreted by
                            me to confirm the views hereinabove expressed.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch, therefore, as Egypt does not possess at the present time the
                            possibility of initiating an independent international economic policy
                            and since my discussion of the principles underlying your program for
                            world recovery would, I fear, only serve to provoke the Egyptian
                            Government into raising actively the question of the conclusion of a
                            trade agreement with the United States, it seemed wise to me to defer
                            the presentation of the statement proposed in your instruction of March
                            11, 1936, until I might communicate with you and learn your views in the
                            light of this statement of the special situation obtaining in Cairo.
                            Further, it did not appear to me that the short delay thus entailed
                            could be harmful.</p>
                        <p>I might add that Egypt has not instituted any quota or clearing
                            arrangements with other countries, imposes no restrictions on the export
                            of exchange and I do not anticipate that in the present healthy state of
                            Egyptian foreign trade and of Egyptian finances that resort will be had
                            to such practices to the detriment of our trade.</p>
                        <p>Should you, notwithstanding the foregoing considerations, desire me to
                            comply with your instruction I shall be pleased to proceed promptly to
                            do so upon hearing from you to that effect.</p>

                        <p>The Egyptian Minister called, saying he had done so at the suggestion of
                            Mr. Phillips.<note n="6" xml:id="d9fn6">William Phillips, Under
                                Secretary of State.</note> He announced that he was shortly leaving
                            for his holiday and wished to ascertain what he might say to his
                            Government regarding the prospects of an Egyptian agreement. He has on a
                            number of occasions discussed this matter with me and there was nothing
                            I could add to what I had told him before. He assumed that the approach
                            of the elections would make unlikely the announcement of new countries
                            with whom negotiations would be undertaken and I did not deny that his
                            assumption might be correct. But what he wished to know particularly was
                            our plans after the election. I said that we were working energetically
                            on the program and would continue to do so and that, while there might
                            not be many announcements as to countries in the immediate future, a
                            great deal of work was being done <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0077"
                            />in the preparation of trade agreement material in the various
                            Departments of the Government. I said that we had considerable data on
                            Egypt and that, while I could not advise him as to the precise date when
                            an agreement might be announced, I would recommend that he ask his
                            Government to prepare data so that when the time arrives, which I hope
                            would be not too far distant, the consummation of an agreement would be
                            expedited.</p>
                        <p>He wished me to give him for his confidential information some of our
                            data that we have gathered together in regard to long-staple cotton. I
                            explained that we could not very well give him confidential departmental
                            material, but that if he would write us a letter, I would gather from
                            the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the Department of Agriculture as
                            complete data on long-staple cotton as is available. He then asked that
                            I give him informally a list of the things we would seek from Egypt that
                            he might take back with him. He said that it was important that he have
                            this as the new Egyptian Government was contemplating trade agreements
                            with various countries and, as “a friend of America”, he wanted to be
                            sure that nothing was done that would prejudice our trade interests in
                            Egypt. I explained that we were not yet prepared to give him our
                            desiderata but said that he and his Government could rather easily
                            determine what our interests would be in a trade agreement from a glance
                            at the trade figures of four or five years ago.</p>
                        <p>It was quite evident that he wished to go back to Egypt with something as
                            a basis for indicating that he had started negotiations here. Although I
                            gave him every encouragement I could without absolute commitments, I did
                            not go beyond that point. I trust that he will not indicate to his
                            Government that even preliminary negotiations have been started.</p>

                        <p>35. My telegram No. 33, June 17, 6 p.m. Acting Judicial Adviser Payne
                            informed me today that in a conversation with the Minister of Justice
                            the latter had stated that in selecting an American successor to Judge
                            Crabitès the Egyptian Government might revert to the procedure followed
                            before 1910 when the candidate was selected on the initiative of the
                            Egyptian Government and the name submitted to the interested governments
                            for approval. Payne added that in the case of the last judge appointed,
                            a Belgian, to fill a temporary vacancy created by the assignment of a
                            Belgian judge to the Code Commission for 2 years, the Egyptian
                            Government followed the procedure now suggested but in his opinion this
                            did not necessarily establish a precedent as the Belgian appointment was
                            not a substantive one.</p>
                        <p>Payne stated that before formulating the attitude of the Judicial
                            Adviser’s office to the suggestion of the Egyptian Minister he desired
                            to obtain my reaction to the proposed procedure. While the exact
                            procedure is not fixed in the charter of the Mixed Courts, article 5
                            thereof indubitably establishes the right of the government of the
                            appointee to approve the appointment (see page 370 [<hi rend="italic"

                            the proposed change with respect to the nomination of judges and desires
                            you to use your best endeavors informally to obtain a continuance of the

                            restrict the possibility of obtaining suitable persons and might place

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Legation’s telegram No. 35 of June 23, 5 p.m., 1936, and the
                            Department’s telegram No. 19 of June 25, 12 noon, 1936, in reply
                            thereto, and to inform the Department that on Saturday morning, June
                            27th, I again called on the Acting Judicial Adviser, Mr. Payne, and
                            informally advised him that my Government would view with disfavor any
                            change in the procedure heretofore followed in the matter of the
                            appointment of a successor to Judge Crabitès.</p>
                        <p>In a conversation I had with Judge Booth, the Judicial Adviser, before
                            his departure from Egypt on leave, the matter of a successor to Judge
                            Crabitès, who at that time had not resigned, was casually discussed.
                            Judge Booth stated that he was only interested in getting a competent
                            successor and trusted that the nominee suggested by our Government would
                            not be a “politician”. He also referred to the fact that Judge Julian M.
                            Wright, American judge of the Mixed Courts of First Instance at Cairo,
                            had strongly recommended the appointment of a Mr. Hill<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d13fn10">Lovering Hill.</note> (I believe I quote the name
                            correctly) now practicing law in Paris.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I have called the Judicial Adviser’s attention to the fact that the
                            recent appointment in the case of the Belgian judge was only temporary
                            and that, as a matter of fact, the Belgian judge who had resigned to
                            accept a position on the Commission to revise the Civil and Commercial
                            Egyptian Code (See my despatch No. 560 of March 19, 1936<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d13fn11">Not printed.</note>), had already been restored to
                            his position as a judge in the Mixed Courts so recently resigned by him;
                            that this fact shows it was purely temporary and that the man selected
                            to fill the vacancy, although appointed for life, resigned the instant
                            his resignation was desired.</p>
                        <p>I further called the attention of the Acting Judicial Adviser to the fact
                            that recently a Greek judge had been appointed to the Mixed Courts, and
                            the procedure upon which my Government insists had been followed.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Judicial Adviser assured me that he would do his utmost—and I
                            believe that he will—to see that our contention prevails. I have,
                            however, indicated to him that in the event he fails I have in mind to
                            present the matter informally directly to the Egyptian authorities.</p>
                        <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0080"/>
                        <p>Sir Miles Lampson, the High Commissioner, is returning to Cairo tomorrow
                            morning and it is quite possible that if the treaty negotiations are to
                            be continued for an extended period the Egyptian Government may
                            procrastinate in this matter of the appointment of an American judge. On
                            the other hand, if the treaty negotiations proceed quickly and favorably
                            for the Egyptians we will, in all probability, receive a quick
                            response.</p>
                        <p>Of course the Department will be promptly advised by telegram from time
                            to time, and the purpose of this despatch is to acquaint the Department
                            more in detail with the situation as I perceive it to exist at this
                            date.</p>

                                27, 1 p.m.; not printed.</note> Acting Judicial Adviser Payne today
                            suggested to me that the selection of an American successor to Judge
                            Crabitès be deferred until the Judicial Adviser Judge Booth returns to
                            Egypt the latter part of August or the early part of September. Payne
                            informs me that the Ministry of Justice is divided in its opinion as to
                            the procedure to be followed but that the matter has not been submitted
                            to the Council of Ministers. Bedaoui Pasha<note n="13" xml:id="d14fn13"

                            to our contention.</p>
                        <p>Preoccupation with treaty negotiations and Parliament tends to minimize
                            other matters at the present time. Before Judge Booth returns Parliament
                            will probably have adjourned and the treaty negotiations may have become
                            less pressing. The Mixed Courts are now on vacation and I believe that
                            our interests will not suffer because of the delay.</p>

                            they may be considered by the Council.</p>

                        <p>53. Department’s telegram No. 25, July 9, 5 p.m. Judge Booth called at
                            the Legation today and stated that the Minister of Justice is strongly
                            opposed to requesting from the United States a list of candidates for
                            vacancy in Mixed Courts and also desires to appoint Mr. Hill. I replied
                            in the sense of the Department’s telegram No. 19.</p>
                        <p>Booth next suggested that he could probably arrange for Egyptian
                            Government to receive a list of nominees provided he was unofficially
                            assured that Hill’s name would be included and especially if the
                            Department would accept his request for such a list in lieu of a formal
                            request through Foreign Office. However, as a last resort and if assured
                            of inclusion of Hill he would endeavor to have a formal request
                            made.</p>
                        <p>He added that most careful consideration would be given to the
                            qualifications of any other candidates suggested.</p>

                        <p>55. My telegram No. 53, September 25, noon. Booth now informs me that the
                            Minister of Justice is unwilling to make formal request for list of
                            candidates and even objects to informal request from Booth followed by
                            formal reply; Minister of Justice states he cannot alter position
                            without consulting Prime Minister. The Prime Minister returns to Egypt
                            October 12th. Minister of Justice has expressed to Booth a desire to see
                            me and may verbally request list of candidates.</p>
                        <p>After stating on the 25th that the question of the American judge going
                            to Mansourah would not arise, Booth now states he and the <pb n="17"

                            hope American Government will not object.</p>
                        <p>I believe Egyptian position unwarranted. Will take no action whatever

                        <p>37. Your 53, September 25, noon, and 55, September 28, noon. The position
                            of this Government with respect to its right to nominate American judges
                            was made perfectly clear in the note quoted in telegram 10, February 24,
                                1920,<note n="14" xml:id="d18fn14">Not printed. In this telegram to
                                the American Agent and Consul General at Cairo, the Department
                                quoted the text of a note to the British Embassy dated February 24,
                                1920, which note reiterated the American position with regard to
                                appointment of American members to the Mixed Tribunals as follows:
                                “this Government cannot admit that the right to nominate American
                                judges for the Mixed Courts belongs to other than this Government.”
                                The Agent was instructed “to bring this matter to the attention of
                                the proper authorities.” (883.05/144)</note> and by the earlier
                            notes referred to therein. This Government cannot admit the introduction
                            of a new practice at this late date, particularly in view of the fact
                            that the old practice of receiving nominations from foreign governments
                            has been followed as recently as the present year. (See paragraph
                                7,<note n="15" xml:id="d18fn15">The paragraph beginning “I further
                                called the attention …”, <ref target="#pg_14">p. 14</ref>.</note>
                            Legation’s despatch 701, June 29, 1936.)</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Department is not disposed to insist that the
                            Egyptian Government make a formal request for this Government’s
                            nominations. An informal request for such nominations from the Minister
                            of Justice, to be answered likewise informally, would be acceptable.
                            Obviously this Government is interested quite as much as the Egyptian
                            Government in seeing that a suitable candidate is appointed and
                            naturally any list of candidates submitted would include only those who
                            are properly qualified. However, the Department cannot agree, even
                            informally and unofficially, to include in such a list any particular
                            name or names.</p>
                        <p>As for the appointment of Judge Crabitès successor to Mansourah, the
                            Department has not altered its position as set forth in telegram 46,
                            October 30, 1929.<note n="16" xml:id="d18fn16">Not printed. In this
                                telegram the Department instructed the Minister in Egypt that “every
                                effort should be made to insure that the proposed appointment be
                                made to Cairo or Alexandria.” (883.05/343)</note></p>
                        <p>The Department does not attach particular importance to the immediate
                            appointment of a new judge and does not desire you to press for <pb
                                n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0083"/>such an appointment at this time.
                            However, if Judge Booth or the Minister of Justice should again bring up
                            the matter you should explain in a most definite manner this
                            Government’s attitude as set forth in the preceding paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>In any such discussion you may also express the personal opinion that at
                            the forthcoming negotiations concerning the termination of the
                            capitulatory regime the attitude of this Government cannot help but be
                            favorably influenced by any good will which the Egyptian Government may
                            show in connection with the appointment under discussion.</p>

                            upon request it was decided that I should see the Minister of Justice
                            this morning. The latter stated that the Egyptian Government would
                            appreciate receiving either verbally or in writing at the earliest
                            convenience of the American Government the name or names of candidates
                            for the post as Judge of the Mixed Courts made vacant by Crabitès’
                            retirement. It was added that the Egyptian Government was completely
                            assured regarding the suitability of those whom the American Government
                            might propose. The Egyptian Government would be pleased to receive the
                            names of nominees as soon as possible but it is suggested that the
                            Department may find it desirable to await my air despatch No. 800 of
                            October 15th.<note n="17" xml:id="d19fn17">Not printed.</note></p>

                        <p>65. Legation’s telegram No. 58, October 19, 1 p.m. Ministry of Justice
                            informs the Legation that the Egyptian Government desires to receive at
                            earliest possible date nominations for an American judge on the Mixed
                            Court to replace Crabitès. Urgency due to the desire of Egyptian
                            Government to conclude appointment before the matter <pb n="19"
                                xml:id="pg_19" facs="0084"/>of the future of the Mixed Court is
                            taken up and also to the need of the courts for an additional judge to
                            relieve the pressure of current work.</p>
                        <p>From authoritative informal information I understand there will be no
                            difficulty in our obtaining a fifth seat incident to the reorganization
                            of the Mixed Courts and the expected creation of seven new seats,
                            including three new counsellors who will in all probability be promoted
                            from the ranks of existing judges.</p>
                        <p>In view of this I urge that nominations for the Crabitès vacancy be made
                            as soon as possible.</p>

                            C. R. Watson, President of the American University at Cairo, regarding
                            the informal representations made recently by the Egypt Inter-Mission
                            Council to the High Commissioner<note n="24" xml:id="d26fn24">Sir Miles
                                Lampson.</note> looking to the safeguarding of the rights of
                            Christian minorities in connection with the treaty to be drafted between
                            the British and Egyptian Governments.</p>
                        <p>As appears from the enclosures, the Egypt Inter-Mission Council in a
                            communication dated February 11, 1936, to the High Commissioner outlined
                            the situation regarding Christian minorities and suggested the
                            safeguards which appeared desirable for their protection on the occasion
                            of the conclusion of any treaty between Great Britain and Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Particular attention was drawn by the Council to the provisions of the
                            Egyptian Constitution declaring “The religion of the country is Islam”
                            which was interpreted by the Egyptian authorities as overriding Article
                            12 according to which “liberty of conscience is absolute”. To safeguard
                            the position of the Christian minority and to further religious liberty
                            in Egypt three suggestions were offered: (1) that the protection of
                            minorities reserved by the British Government in its Declaration of

                            the League of Nations upon the conclusion of a treaty the Egyptian
                            Government should make a declaration with regard to religious liberty
                            similar to that contained in Articles 15 and 16 of the Declaration of
                            the Kingdom of Iraq, of May 30, 1932,<note n="27" xml:id="d26fn27"

                            regime in Iraq.</p>
                        <p>On February 26, 1936, the High Commissioner received a delegation from
                            the Inter-Mission Council at which time the point of view of that
                            Council was expressed in further detail. It was stated that experience
                            had proved that the Articles of the Egyptian Constitution regarding
                            religious liberty offered no practical safeguards such as the situation
                            in Egypt demanded. Thus, religious liberty had been “officially
                            interpreted to mean only the right of each minority to worship in its
                            own way, and not the right of an adult to change his faith <pb n="22"
                                xml:id="pg_22" facs="0087"/>according to his convictions”. Moreover,
                            while a procedure existed for the registration of conversions from
                            Christianity to Islam, there was no corresponding procedure for the
                            registration of conversions from Islam to Christianity.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Watson, as spokesman of the delegation, referred to the
                            “consternation” caused the Council in 1929 and 1930 when, on the
                            occasion of treaty negotiations in those years, it was learned that the
                            British Government had expressed its intention<note n="28"

                            question of minorities in future as the exclusive concern of the
                            Egyptian Government. In appealing for a reconsideration of this
                            intention now on the occasion of the forthcoming negotiations, Doctor
                            Watson cited the laws recently passed in Palestine regarding religious
                            liberty, the stipulations attending Iraq’s admission to the League, and
                            the action of the League in 1933 in urging upon all states to make
                            effective within their own territories the regulations for the
                            protection of minorities which have been required in mandated
                            territories.</p>
                        <p>In his reply the High Commissioner observed that: <list>

                                    the Council had at that time made representations to it, it
                                    would probably be very difficult, though he would not say
                                    impossible, to persuade the Egyptian delegation to accept any

                                    in mind what the Council had said, when the time came for the

                        <p>From Doctor Watson’s letter of March 4, 1936, to the Legation it will be
                            observed that it appears likely the International Missionary Council in
                            New York may approach the Department in order that the Ambassador in
                            London may be instructed to raise with the Foreign Office the subject of
                            the safeguarding of religious liberty in Egypt as was authorized by the
                            Department in 1930 on the occasion of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty

                        <p>The general situation as regards religious liberty in Egypt and the
                            possible means of safeguarding the rights of Christian minorities has
                            been so exhaustively covered in the Legation’s despatch No. 355 of April
                            8, 1930, and in a memorandum of the British Judicial Adviser forwarded
                            by Minister Gunther on April 8, 1930, to the Chief of the Near East
                            Division, that no extended review of the situation appears called for at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that the principal problem involved in 1930, as now,
                            was that of the disabilities to which Moslem converts to Christianity
                            are exposed under the Sharia law (see Memorandum on the legal status of
                            Mohammedan converts to Christianity enclosed in the Legation’s despatch
                            No. 355 of April 8, 1930). Such disabilities include: deprivation of a
                            convert’s patrimony and the absence of any facilities for registration
                            of such conversion as exists in the case of Christian converts to Islam.
                            This situation and the difficulties of obtaining redress of these
                            disabilities in a Moslem State in the immediate future are thoroughly
                            examined in the memorandum of the British Judicial Adviser mentioned
                            above. They were likewise pertinently set forth in the London Embassy’s
                            despatch No. 866 of May 5, 1930, to the Department, in which the point
                            of view of the Foreign Office was stated to be that the correction of
                            these disabilities would have to be a gradual process and that this
                            evolutionary movement was likely to be hindered rather than furthered by
                            insistence upon legislation over-riding the Sharia law. Such was also
                            the considered opinion, it will be recollected, of the British Judicial
                            Adviser in Egypt, as well as that of the Legation.</p>
                        <p>As regards the Inter-Mission Council’s suggestion that the protection of
                            minorities, which was one of the reserved points of the British
                            Declaration of 1922, should not be surrendered in any treaty arrangement
                            with Egypt, it may be noted that the High Commissioner considers that
                            “inasmuch as the British Foreign Office had made its statement in 1930
                            about minorities, despite the fact that the Council had <pb n="24"
                                xml:id="pg_24" facs="0089"/>at that time made representations to it,
                            it would probably be very difficult, though he would not say impossible,
                            to persuade the Egyptian delegation to accept any modification of that
                            statement”.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the second suggestion of the Council for the enactment of
                            legislation similar to that of the Palestine Succession Ordinance the
                            High Commissioner, it may be observed, stated that he might, quite apart
                            from the treaty, endeavor to ascertain from the Prime Minister whether
                            some legal redress was not obtainable for converts from Islam to
                            Christianity, especially in the registration of converts.</p>
                        <p>In the High Commissioner’s opinion, however, the solution of the
                            situation was rather to be sought in the suggestion of the Council that
                            Egypt be asked to make a declaration similar to that required of Iraq
                            before being admitted to the League.</p>
                        <p>From the present enclosed communications it would seem that a more
                            realistic view of the difficulties in the way of the attainment by
                            legislation of an increasing measure of religious liberty in Egypt is
                            now taken than in 1930. Moreover, it would appear that the means now
                            suggested for the safeguarding of the rights of Christian minorities in
                            Egypt are more practical than those proposed by the Inter-Mission
                            Council in 1930.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it would appear to me that, as in 1930, the British Foreign
                            Office might be approached informally and, in making inquiries as to
                            whether any steps are being taken to safeguard religious liberties in
                            Egypt in connection with the new arrangements that are being made
                            between Great Britain and Egypt, the hope might be expressed that
                            sympathetic consideration be accorded the present reasonable suggestions
                            of the Egypt Inter-Mission Council, particularly that concerning the
                            making by Egypt of a declaration similar to that made by Iraq incident

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s instruction No. 1501 of November 27, 1936, authorizing the
                            Embassy to inquire at the Foreign Office whether it is proposed to
                            request the Egyptian Government, at the time of the proposed admission
                            of that country into the League of Nations, to furnish appropriate
                            guarantees or to give assurances with respect to religious liberties.
                            The question was taken up with the Foreign Office in the sense of the
                            Department’s instruction under reference, and the Embassy was given the
                            following information with the request that it be kept strictly
                            confidential.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office said that it had this question very much in <pb n="27"
                                xml:id="pg_27" facs="0092"/>mind and while the High Commissioner in
                            Cairo had “been given a line to follow” in presenting the missionaries’
                            case, the matter was a delicate one and Sir Miles Lampson would have a
                            fairly free hand as regards the details and the manner in which it
                            should be taken up with the Egyptian Government. The Foreign Office,
                            therefore, did not know whether, if the High Commissioner’s
                            representations were successful, they would result in the giving of
                            guarantees by the Egyptian Government at the time of the proposed
                            admission of that country into the League of Nations, but the Foreign
                            Office hoped that the Egyptian Government would see the wisdom of making
                            a suitable declaration on the subject of religious liberties some time
                            prior to its admission into the League of Nations. They suggested that
                            it might be awkward for Egypt to be asked by the League what the
                            situation was, and that it would be far more dignified for the Egyptian
                            Government to make a purely voluntary statement.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office pointed out that there was always a danger of pressing
                            a country like Egypt too much, which, if affronted, “might dig its toes
                            in”, and therefore the matter was one which should be dealt with with
                            the greatest tact and discretion.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the conversation, the Foreign Office again emphasized their
                            request that their remarks be kept in the strictest confidence.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that on Thursday evening, December 10th, at six o’clock I attended a
                            meeting of the Anglo-American Hospital Board at the Residency. Of this
                            organization the High Commissioner is Chairman and the American Minister
                            is the Vice-Chairman.</p>
                        <p>The meeting consumed only about fifteen minutes and at its conclusion the
                            High Commissioner asked me into his private office.…</p>
                        <p>Apparently he had detained me primarily to discuss with me what he was
                            doing with reference to safe-guarding the rights of Christian minorities
                            in Egypt. He recalled the informal representations that had been made to
                            him by the Egypt Inter-Mission Council looking to the safe-guarding of
                            the rights of Christian minorities in connection with the treaty between
                            the British and Egyptian Governments. (See my despatch No. 551 of March
                            10, 1936.)</p>
                        <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0093"/>
                        <p>The High Commissioner stated that his Government looked with favor upon
                            the suggestion that Egypt voluntarily make a declaration similar to that
                            made by Iraq before being admitted to membership in the League. He told
                            me that he had already approached the Minister of Foreign Affairs about
                            the matter and that the Minister agrees fully with him that the Egyptian
                            representatives at Geneva should make such a declaration. It must,
                            however, be borne in mind that the Minister of Foreign Affairs is a
                            Copt, as well as is Makram Ebeid Pasha, the Minister of Finance, whom I
                            regard as the brainiest and most clever member of the Cabinet. The High
                            Commissioner further stated that he was taking the matter up with the
                            Prime Minister but that he was proceeding cautiously for it was a
                            delicate matter about which to approach him.</p>

                        <p>72. I learn confidentially that some concern exists on the part of the
                            High Commissioner’s own advisers regarding the perfunctory attitude
                            which he is taking towards the Capitulations Conference as he has
                            expressed himself as of the belief that it may all be settled in a
                            couple of days once the Conference is convened.</p>
                        <p>While the Conference is not expected to encounter any insuperable
                            difficulties the satisfactory solution of the complicated problems which
                            will be raised thereat requires careful preparatory study. In my opinion
                            which is shared by those in whom I have confidence Egyptian Government
                            when issuing invitations to the powers should present at least its
                            general proposals. Failing that it would seem inevitable that when the
                            delegates assemble it will be necessary to request an adjournment for
                            time to study them. I believe that it might be advisable for the
                            Department to approach the British Foreign Office informally to suggest
                            the possible desirability that the Egyptian invitation should be
                            accompanied by the Egyptian proposals. As yet no decision has been taken
                            on the form of the invitation nor as to the time and place of the
                            Conference.</p>

                        <p>46. Your 63, November 19, 9 a.m. Unless you perceive some objection the
                            Department desires you to express to the Egyptian Government, in such
                            manner as you consider appropriate, the hope that prior to the convening
                            of the proposed capitulations conference ample opportunity will be
                            afforded this Government to study the proposals which are to be put
                            forward. In this connection it must be borne in mind that in view of the
                            length of time required to transmit documents between Egypt and the
                            United States, this Government will require somewhat longer to make the
                            necessary preparations than will European countries. Furthermore,
                            depending upon the nature of the Egyptian proposals and the method by
                            which it is sought to accomplish them, it may be necessary for this
                            Government to seek legislative enactments from Congress. Under the
                            circumstances the Department earnestly hopes that it may have before it
                            the Egyptian proposals not less than 2 months prior to the convening of
                            the proposed <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0095"/>conference. Only by
                            being afforded such an opportunity for studying the views of the
                            Egyptian Government can this Government give them the attentive and
                            sympathetic consideration which it desires. Any indications, even
                            informal, which the Egyptian Government may meanwhile be in a position
                            to furnish as to its views with respect to an adjustment of the
                            capitulatory problem will obviously facilitate the task of this
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>As no other power has as yet interested itself officially in the subject

                            take the lead in raising the question of the desirability of the
                            presentation by the Egyptian Government, when issuing the invitations to
                            the Conference, of written proposals in elaboration of the points raised
                            in the Anglo-Egyptian treaty.</p>

                            until I am informed of the Department’s further views in the light of
                            this and of the suggestion made in my telegram No. 72. Should the
                            British Foreign Office agree to raise the question of detailed proposals
                            I would thereafter present to the Egyptian Government the Department’s
                            views. At the same time it might be desirable, irrespective of whether
                            the British Government agreed to act, for the Department to approach the
                            French, Italian, Greek, and Belgian Governments in order that the
                            principal capitulatory powers might act in concert in the matter as I
                            believe we should endeavor to avoid being made solely responsible for
                            any postponement of the Conference.</p>

                        <p>74. The Minister of Foreign Affairs informed Childs<note n="40"
                                xml:id="d36fn40">J. Rives Childs, Second Secretary of Legation in
                                Egypt.</note> at a social gathering last evening that invitations to
                            the Conference were being held up owing to the postponement of the
                            exchange of ratifications of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty consequent upon
                            the failure of King Edward the VIII to sign any state documents
                            including the treaty during the present constitutional crisis. He added
                            that it was the present intention of the Egyptian Government to allow at
                            least 2 months between the date of the issuance of the invitations and
                            the convening of Conference and that it was contemplated the invitations
                            would include the program of the Conference which would follow the lines
                            of the annex to article 13 of the treaty. The Minister stated that if
                            the convening of the Conference coincided with the meeting of the League
                            which received Egypt as a member the Conference would probably be held
                            in Geneva.</p>

                            Following is text of telegram of December 9 from Embassy at London:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Department’s 436, December 5, 2 p.m.,<note n="41"

                                    Foreign Office who stated that they thought invitations <pb
                                        n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0097"/>to the proposed
                                    Capitulations Conference would be ready within 10 days or 2
                                    weeks and that detailed Egyptian proposals for the conference
                                    would probably be available in Cairo about February 1, next. The
                                    Foreign Office pointed out in this connection that the annex to
                                    Article 13 of the Treaty of Alliance between the United Kingdom
                                    and Egypt outlines the proposals.</p>
                                <p>The Foreign Office said it was still doubtful whether the
                                    conference would take place in Cairo or in some town in
                                    Switzerland but they thought it possible that it might convene
                                    about March 1. The Embassy pointed out that this would only
                                    leave one month from the date of the issue in Cairo of the
                                    detailed Egyptian proposals and the date of the opening of the
                                    conference, and that the Department earnestly hoped that it
                                    might have before it the Egyptian proposals not less than two
                                    months prior to the convening of the conference. The Foreign
                                    Office said that the Egyptian Government desired to have the
                                    Capitulations Conference as soon as possible and though the
                                    dates given above were only guesses and might both be subject to
                                    change, especially postponement, the Foreign Office thought it
                                    most unlikely that there would be as much as 2 months between
                                    the issuance of the detailed proposals and the convening of the
                                    conference.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In view of the complexity of the subject and the lack of information as
                            to the method by which the Egyptian Government proposes to terminate the
                            capitulatory regime it is doubtful if any useful purpose would be served
                            by approaching certain of the capitulatory Powers as suggested in your
                            73, December 7, 9 a.m. Moreover, since the above quoted telegram from
                            London indicates that the Egyptian Government intends eventually to
                            issue detailed proposals, no reason is perceived why you should not now
                            discuss this matter with the appropriate Egyptian authorities in
                            accordance with the Department’s 46, December 5, 2 p.m. In such
                            discussions you should make clear that in asking for ample opportunity
                            to consider the detailed Egyptian proposals the Department, far from
                            intending to be obstructive, has in mind the possible necessity of
                            extensive preparations including legislation, which may be required
                            under American constitutional forms, to enable the President to give
                            prompt effect to any decisions that may eventually be reached respecting
                            the termination of the capitulatory regime. In this connection you will
                            recall the Act of 1874,<note n="42" xml:id="d38fn42">18 Stat. 23.</note>
                            which empowered the President merely to suspend certain aspects of our
                            capitulatory rights in Egypt. See also in this connection fourth
                            paragraph of note to British Government quoted in Department’s

                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that while he fully appreciated
                            my Government’s position, the Egyptian Government was considering
                            February 15th for the opening of the Conference as it was desirous of
                            holding it as soon as possible. As it would probably take place in
                            Switzerland he assumed that less advance notice would be required by my
                            Government. Although invitations would be issued in a few days it would
                            be impossible to present detailed proposals in their entirety for some
                            little time but he assured me that as soon as different points had been
                            agreed upon he would inform me of them progressively either officially
                            or informally in advance of their formal presentation to the powers
                            before the Conference.</p>
                        <p>My Italian colleague has agreed to support my representations and he is
                            inviting French Minister to do likewise.</p>

                            Conference was still under discussion. In his opinion too great haste
                            was being shown by the Egyptian Government which would not have its
                            detailed proposals ready before January 15th at the earliest. He
                            expressed the opinion that it would not be feasible for the Conference
                            to be convened before March 15th.</p>

                            <p>1. Foreign Office note dated yesterday informs me that on December 23
                                Italian planes used bombs containing asphyxiating and tear gases
                                against Ethiopian troops in Takkaze region. Ethiopian Government
                                desires me bring this to your attention as violation of Washington

                                    is still playing into the hands of the Abyssinians, and just as
                                    in October and November unexpectedly late rains hampered Italian
                                    movements; so did an unexpectedly early beginning of the
                                    so-called little rains towards the end of December which
                                    ordinarily do not fall before early February. It is also
                                    possible that the Italian Government ordered a slowing down of
                                    military operations while France and Britain were making their
                                    peace efforts. In any event it looks as if so far things were

                                    most of the fighting had been between reconnoitering detachments
                                    and although Abyssinian resistance had been much stiffer than
                                    even the texts of the few and meager communiqués would indicate,
                                    no large units were involved and the losses on either side were
                                    insignificant. The Italians had been advancing with the utmost
                                    caution evidently in the hope of effecting a kind of pacific
                                    [apparent omission] by the distribution of propaganda leaflets
                                    from the air behind the Ethiopian lines and by special efforts
                                    to give remunerative employment to the inhabitants corduroy road
                                    making in occupied territories. But the ineptitude of the
                                    propaganda and the ruthlessness with which the Italian armies
                                    are reported to have commandeered grain, cattle and fodder from
                                    a half starving population nullified all attempts to gain their
                                    good will. Since Guksa’s treason of November only minor and
                                    unimportant chiefs have voluntarily submitted to the Italians
                                    and the number of their followers has been negligible.</item>

                                <item>Even the slow and careful advance of the Italians seems to
                                    have been too rapid to prevent the formation of enemy guerrilla
                                    bands behind their lines whose mobility and agility subjected
                                    the Italian troops to severe tests. By the middle of December it
                                    had become evident that large Italian forces could not move much
                                    faster along narrow mountain trails than their engineers could
                                    construct roads behind them. For, although artillery and tanks
                                    mark Italy’s greatest superiority over the Abyssinians, this
                                    advantage is almost canceled by lack of roads and an elusive

                                <item>Another advantage, namely, that of a highly organized air
                                    force has likewise proved disappointing to the Italians for it
                                    was found that in the absence of forts, arsenals and industrial
                                    centers, there were comparatively few targets suitable for
                                    bombing. As explained in my 206 [<hi rend="italic">208</hi>],
                                    paragraph 15, Abyssinian troops scatter and hide by day and
                                    reassemble to march or attack at night. Besides an extremely
                                    high percentage of Italian bombs proved to be duds which
                                    considerably lessened the moral effect air action might
                                    otherwise have had. However, throughout December intense aerial
                                    activities were reported from both fronts of which the raid on
                                    Dessie was probably the largest operation. According to an
                                    official Ethiopian report some 3,000 bombs were dropped south of
                                    Makale during the week ended December 31st. There is a small
                                    landing field at Makale which has increased Italian air range
                                    southward but most of the machines operating on the northern
                                    front are based on Assab, Asmara and Aksum. Besides Dessie the
                                    following places in the north have been subjected to severe
                                    raids; <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0101"/>Ambai, Antalo,
                                    Buia, Dabat and Gondar. In the south Dagabur has been the
                                    principal target but on December 30th in bombing a point 50
                                    miles north of Dolo a Swedish Red Cross unit was badly wrecked.
                                    So far neither Harrar nor [apparent omission] have been bombed
                                    and the fact that no attempt has been made to destroy railway to
                                    Djibouti at any point is interpreted here as indicating that
                                    there is understanding on the question between the Italian and
                                    French Governments.</item>

                                <item>While Badoglio’s appointment would seem to imply that Italy no
                                    longer regards her African war as in the category of purely
                                    colonial punitive expeditions, his appointment—apart from
                                    intensified air activity—appears to have made surprisingly
                                    little difference, considering how much had been expected of him
                                    even by the Abyssinians. On the other hand the Emperor’s
                                    presence at Dessie—where he had gone only after he had
                                    personally reviewed all his vassals and their troops which

                                    be important developments. In fact, for Ethiopia the war is only
                                    now beginning in earnest because the concentration of her armies
                                    has but recently been completed. Her warriors who have been
                                    restrained with difficulty by their leaders are spoiling for a
                                    fight, and it may be said that during the past month their
                                    tactics of retiring and luring the enemy as far as possible into

                                    to the fact that the Abyssinians are now not only ready to stand
                                    their ground but to advance. It is also clear that contrary to
                                    earlier expectations the principal fighting will be on the
                                    northern front although it is less clear why the Italians should
                                    have chosen it for their main effort considering that the

                                    seems so much greater than in the south. Tempted perhaps by

                                    the Italian Seventh Army Corps under Biroli has been trying to
                                    drive a wedge between the Ethiopian forces but without success.

                                    roads to Berbera and Zeila and the railway to Djibouti. But
                                    Graziani was only given two divisions for a front of some 400
                                    miles and he was apparently obliged to spread them too thinly
                                    and too widely to advance successfully on Jig Jiga and Harrar.

                                    from both Italian and Ethiopian sources are quite unreliable.
                                    Like the Somali nomads, the Danakil tribes are of doubtful value
                                    to either side and the support of most of the minor chiefs can
                                    at least temporarily be purchased with cash and rifles. Thus it
                                    seems that the small Sultanate of Bisu in the extreme north,
                                    being wedged in between the Italian forces under Santini in the

                                    Makale. But the fact remains that after 14 weeks and little
                                    opposition they have not even penetrated as far as they did in

                            <p>16. I have been confidentially informed by the Secretary General of
                                the International Committee of the Red Cross that the President of
                                the Committee, Dr. Huber, is in receipt of a personal letter from
                                Mussolini dated January 16 which Red Cross officials here consider
                                of great importance as showing a disposition on the part of the
                                Italian Government to respect its commitments under the Geneva and
                                Hague Conventions.</p>
                            <p>The Committee desires to communicate its contents to the National Red
                                Cross societies and has sought permission from Rome to do so and its
                                contents are treated as strictly confidential even the fact of its
                                receipt being withheld from the press. I have been given to
                                understand, however, that it embodies the following points.</p>
                            <p>The Italian Government has complete confidence in the impartiality of
                                the International Committee in the exercise of its good offices. It
                                    <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0105"/>fully approves of the
                                humanitarian principles and objectives of the Red Cross and deplores
                                the “accidents” which have occurred as a result of the operations of
                                the Italian air forces over wide areas and under the difficulty of
                                limiting the objective of aerial bombardment. Italian aviators it
                                said will endeavor to respect hospitals and dressing stations shown
                                to be under Red Cross protection in spite of their use by combatants
                                as places of refuge.</p>
                            <p>Attention was again called to the alleged widespread improper use of
                                the Red Cross by Ethiopians and it was requested that the Committee
                                instruct its mission in Ethiopia to investigate the situation.</p>
                            <p>Particular reference was made to the most recent Italian complaint
                                regarding atrocities and use of dumdum bullets. (Consulate’s
                                telegram No. 15, January 20, 3 p.m.<note n="10" xml:id="d43fn10"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_94">p.
                                    94</ref>.</note>). This was cited as showing the pressing need
                                for an investigation by the International Committee’s
                                representatives in Ethiopia and for continued efforts to restrain
                                Ethiopians from perpetrating acts contrary to the generally
                                recognized standards of warfare.</p>
                            <p>I am told that the tone of the communication was extremely courteous.
                                This in addition to its context causes the Committee to feel that
                                the Italian Government has finally become responsive to world
                                opinion in the matter of the bombardment of hospital units. No
                                particular reference was made in the communication to the
                                bombardment of the Swedish hospital although the exchanges of
                                letters in that case between the International Committee and the
                                Italian Red Cross are believed to have prompted Mussolini’s unusual
                                course in writing directly and in person to Dr. Huber.</p>
                            <p>Red Cross officials have expressed to me their feeling that this
                                communication from Mussolini is a striking justification of the
                                Committee’s policy of absolute neutrality which has been criticized
                                in some quarters as showing moderation and caution with respect to
                                Ethiopian complaints of Italian air bombardment.</p>

                            <p>87. My 14, January 7, noon and telegrams regarding military
                                operations since then.</p>
                            <p>1. Difficulties of preparing analysis of military situation continue
                                as my attempts to secure promptly and regularly information of
                                events at the front have not proved successful. Reliable reports
                                literally only trickle through even when favorable to the
                                Ethiopians, while news of reverses can hardly be obtained at all.
                                The following estimate of the situation is therefore subject to
                                correction in the light of more accurate information which may be in
                                the possession of the Military Attaché at Dessie.</p>
                            <p>2. The torrential rains, which have now been falling for 6 weeks and
                                apparently all over the country with the exception of the Ogaden,
                                have proved far more useful to the Ethiopians than the efforts of
                                the League of Nations. It is said that not since 1907 have such
                                unseasonal rains occurred at this time of year. Ordinarily, January
                                is the driest month of all and the Legation’s records show for
                                example that not a drop of rain fell in January of the years 1929,
                                32, 33, 34, and 35. But last month 105 millimeters fell which would
                                be normal for June and might be exceeded only in July, August or
                                September. In fact we have had cloudbursts in January and early this
                                month which exceeded in intensity anything experienced in the
                                preponderant rain season.</p>
                            <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0108"/>
                            <p>3. The effect of these untimely rains on Italian transport can only
                                be imagined when the physical difficulties confronting an invading
                                army even in the dry season are remembered. See e. g. paragraph 3,
                                my 208, December 5, 10 p.m.<note n="16" xml:id="d46fn16"><ref
                                        target="frus1935v01#pg_689"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                            Relations</hi>, 1935, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>,
                                        p. 689</ref>.</note> With the mountainous part of the
                                country deluged, the hastily constructed emergency roads must have
                                been washed away in many places and become unfit for long sustained
                                traffic of heavy trucks, armored cars, and tanks. For even light
                                motor transport is difficult to handle in the rainy season over
                                Abyssinia’s precipitous rolling and rocky uplands. Morale and health
                                of the troops must also have been affected by the hardships of
                                marching, drenched to the skin, with heavy packs at high altitudes,
                                and after vitality of many had probably been lowered by a long stay
                                in Eritrea. Rains and constantly overcast skies also caused low
                                visibility and interfered considerably with air reconnaissance.</p>
                            <p>4. But the adverse factors of climate and altitude alone can hardly
                                account for the fact that the Italian expeditionary forces have not
                                been making much headway. The middle of the fifth month of war finds
                                the main Abyssinian armies almost entirely intact and the military
                                prospects for the Italians not very bright. As it must be assumed
                                that Badoglio was given a free hand when Italy realized last
                                December that nothing could be gained diplomatically by holding back
                                in the field, his failure to improve upon the performance of de Bono
                                has elated the Ethiopian Government and must be particularly
                                discouraging to Borne. Considering the powerful and carefully
                                prepared war machine he has at his disposal, the unimportant
                                successes so far obtained would seem to point to either faulty staff
                                work in the plans of attack, or incompetence, or low morale in their
                                execution.</p>
                            <p>5. By keeping careful count of Suez Canal traffic figures it can be
                                ascertained that Italy has by now nearly 350,000 men in East Africa
                                including laborers and native levies. And yet Badoglio is understood
                                to have asked for more because he considers his fronts dangerously
                                over-extended and vulnerable. Among the reinforcements he has
                                recently received and which Ethiopians report as having gone into
                                action on the northern front is an Alpine division especially
                                trained and equipped for mountain warfare but its arrival has been
                                followed by rumors that it is not considered loyal to the Fascist
                                regime. What is certain is that more and more white troops are being
                                used in addition to the Eritrean Askaris, and Somali Dubats who have
                                hitherto borne the brunt of the fighting.</p>
                            <p>6. While the accumulation of large Italian reserves indicates that a
                                new and vigorous push forward is in preparation, one cannot help but
                                wonder whether in the light of the experience of the past 4 months
                                larger armies will not find the difficulties of maintaining
                                themselves <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0109"/>far from their
                                bases almost insuperable. According to Italian sources, 7 tons of
                                foodstuffs are required per day for every thousand men, not counting
                                ammunitions which may run to 10 tons for each day in action. To have
                                all this has already proved the formidable task for the Italian
                                supply transport and is bound to increase as the lines of
                                communications lengthen. Fortunately for the Italians they have no
                                Ethiopian air force to contend with or they could not have achieved
                                even the insignificant gains they have. For, as pointed out in
                                previous reports, a highly mechanized army is distinctly handicapped
                                under conditions prevailing in Abyssinia where heavy tanks, armored
                                cars, and cumbersome artillery become increasingly useless as they
                                penetrate into the interior.</p>
                            <p>7. Not even the admittedly high engineering skill of the Italians has
                                been able to cope with the amount of dangerous road making in front
                                and behind their main positions required in this campaign. And
                                despite the fact that large numbers of troops are engaged in
                                protecting these roads, they have failed to prevent infiltrations
                                [of] Ethiopian forces behind the Italian lines where they harass the
                                supply services. Situation is aggravated by the impossibility of
                                disarming hostile inhabitants in occupied areas who help the
                                Abyssinian armies whenever they have a chance. One of the most
                                baffling problems the Italians have on their hands is precisely the
                                adequate protection of their flanks against surprise attacks in view
                                of the impracticability of maintaining contact between the advancing
                                columns by lateral communications. What they seem to lack most are
                                fairly large self-contained flying columns unhampered by tanks or
                                armored cars which could adopt the guerrilla tactics of their
                                enemies.</p>
                            <p>8. That these tactics have so far proved surprisingly effective must
                                be admitted. Even such European drill as the regular army may have
                                had does not seem to have spoilt the natural cunning of the
                                individual warrior. Most of them are expert guerrilla
                                fighters—fleet-footed, tireless, and brave—accustomed to making the
                                best use of the difficult ground which so admirably suits their
                                nature. Although quite capable of taking the initiative in night
                                raids and similar surprise attacks, they proved themselves
                                sufficiently disciplined to avoid pitched battles before the main
                                armies were ready. They have learned to dig trenches and construct
                                primitive forts and although there is still a dearth of capable
                                leadership, reconnaissance work has improved, and the various chiefs
                                seem now to inform one another of their movements. Arms and
                                munitions have recently been arriving in considerable quantities
                                including antitank guns, automatic rifles, and portable batteries.
                                But most important of all, the morale of the Abyssinians has held up
                                remarkably well and in the many fierce hand-to-hand fights that have
                                taken place, they have shown great tenacity in holding their ground
                                even against superior numbers.</p>
                            <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0110"/>
                            <p>9. However, the very fact that it can truthfully be said of the
                                Abyssinians that they are no longer afraid of the Italians harbors
                                serious dangers for them. Being impatient and impetuous by
                                temperament, they are apt to underestimate the risks and to commit
                                grave tactical and strategic blunders. For example, several times
                                during the recent fighting machine gun nests were attacked by hordes
                                of men armed with nothing but swords and spears and their losses
                                were terrific. Or they would storm Italian positions only to be
                                driven out again because they did not realize the range of artillery
                                fire. And making a night attack failed because they disregarded the
                                fact that the enemy possessed searchlights. But probably most
                                serious of all is their pathetically poor supply system which
                                greatly reduces and hampers the radius of their activities. Some
                                months ago the rases at the front even had to request the Emperor
                                not to send them any more men as they were unable to feed them and
                                although this has been remedied to some extent, the concentration of
                                large forces is still extremely difficult just for that reason.</p>
                            <p>10. The Italian air forces have not, on the whole, proved very
                                effective as an offensive weapon chiefly because of the inability of
                                infantry to exploit results of bombing by attacking and occupying
                                objectives. As stated in paragraph 3 above, visibility has been bad
                                due to the cloudy weather. There are practically no landing places
                                in northern Abyssinia and the mountains and treacherous air currents
                                make flying unusually hazardous. Although thousands of high
                                explosive bombs have been dropped, especially on villages between
                                Makale and Dessie, and there is hardly any anti-aircraft defense,
                                they never had the demoralizing effect the Italians expected, and
                                the natives have even stood gas bombing very well although they have
                                no gas masks. Nevertheless, Italian scouting planes must have done
                                much useful reconnaissance work and prevented surprise attacks, and
                                by bombing cattle and important wells they intensified the scarcity
                                of food and water among the defenders.</p>
                            <p>11. Reference should perhaps be made here to constant accusations of
                                violations of rules and customs of war by both belligerents.
                                Ethiopian Government and people are thoroughly aroused by what seems
                                deliberate bombing of Bed Cross units, of defenseless villages and
                                towns as if the extermination of the civilian population were
                                intended, bombing and burning of churches, use of poison gas, and
                                ill-treatment of women. Reprisals have been threatened by
                                confiscating all Italian property in the country. The Italians on
                                the other hand accuse Abyssinians of using dumdum and explosive
                                bullets and of all kinds of inhuman practices such as killing
                                prisoners and mutilating the dead. As usual in warfare both sides
                                have probably been guilty of excesses but it seems easier to explain
                                them when committed by primitive tribesmen who have been exasperated
                                and infuriated by a cold <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0111"
                                />blooded attempt to seize their country than on the part of a
                                nation which pretends to have the civilizing missions and might
                                therefore have reasonably been expected to set an example.</p>
                            <p>12. From information available here, it is impossible to determine
                                exact line of the present fronts either in the north or in the south
                                but the general situation seems to be as follows:</p>
                            <p>Northern front. During 10-day battle at the end of January the
                                Italian offensive was successfully stopped in the Tembien region by
                                Ras Seyoum’s army. Without necessarily accepting Ethiopian figure,
                                it is said that Italian losses were exceedingly heavy, especially in
                                killed who in all engagements so far seems to have been far more
                                numerous than either wounded or prisoners. Fierce aggressiveness of
                                the Abyssinians in this battle showed not only determination to hold
                                Tembien Massif at all costs but to take the offensive whenever
                                conditions were favorable. Much credit for the victory is given to
                                Dejazmatch Hailukabada who had served under both Ras Seyoum and Ras
                                Kassthe[?].</p>
                            <p>Immediate result of the battle has been to endanger the Italian
                                salient at Makale, fighting as close as 15 miles west of Makale
                                being reported where the Italian right flank was weakly held.
                                Gheralta region north of Makale had never been really completely
                                occupied by the Italians and they are now being forced to withdraw
                                all their exposed outposts in order to save at least the road to
                                Adigrat. Ras Seyoum is already reported to be astride the
                                Adowa–Makale road and to be in touch with Kassa Sebhat who has been
                                severely harassing the Italian left flank. Makale may thus already
                                be encircled, for the road south is blocked by Ras Mulugeta and the
                                Italians never advanced beyond Shelikot some 15 miles south of
                                Makale. It is now apparent that the Italian base line Aksum-Adigrat
                                became much too short when Makale was taken and that so long as
                                Dejazmatch Ayaleu is not dislodged from the right bank of the
                                Takkaze further Italian advances will always be in danger of having
                                their retreat cut off.</p>
                            <p>If it be true that Badoglio has now four army corps of about 250,000
                                men on the northern front it is firmly believed in local circles
                                that at least 100,000 of them are held in readiness for a possible
                                invasion of the Sudan.</p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Southern front. Fortunately for Ethiopia
                                the spectacular Italian successes on the Ganaledoria River in the
                                second half of January have so far not had any decisive
                                consequences, although at one time the situation looked critical. As
                                Graziani had been clamoring for reinforcements he was apparently
                                given two more divisions in December and should now have about
                                75,000 men. He, therefore, decided to take the offensive and chose
                                Borana [<hi rend="italic">Boran</hi>] because it offered relatively
                                easy chances of success, would stop Ras Desta’s advance on Dolo and
                                remove his threat to the Italian center column. The latter <pb
                                    n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0112"/>had been concentrating near
                                the junction of the Webi Shebeli and Fafan Rivers which led to the
                                belief that the fresh push on Sassabaneh was in preparation. But
                                this was evidently a feint and the real attack came from Dolo. First
                                Ras Desta’s advance guard was driven from its entire positions some
                                40 miles northeast of Dolo and on or about January 12 the Italian
                                offensive in force began in the area between the Ganale Doria and
                                Dawa Rivers. Armored cars and light tanks overcame resistance of
                                Abyssinians and by January 16th road to Ras Desta’s headquarters at
                                Negghelli was cleared by using hundreds of trucks. Italian infantry
                                was moved swiftly the 230 miles from Dolo to Negghelli, the latter
                                was occupied January 22nd and 4 or 5 days later some motorized units
                                appear to have reached Wadara.</p>
                            <p>Principal aim was evidently to reach road from Moyale on the Kenya
                                border to Addis Ababa which in the dry season is practicable for
                                motor traffic. That would have meant direct threat to the capital as
                                no large Ethiopian forces were concentrated there. But the country
                                beyond Negghelli is very broken and thickly wooded, and although Ras
                                Desta’s army had been dispersed, it had not been destroyed. The
                                Italians, therefore, were not only unable to reach the main road,
                                but had to withdraw from Wadara. In the meantime Ethiopian
                                reinforcements concentrated in the lake district this side of the
                                Sidaamo Mountains under Dejazmatch Makonnen, Governor of Wolamo, and
                                the scattered forces of Desta are being reassembled after obtaining
                                fresh food supplies from northern Sidaamo. Incidentally the
                                Ethiopian Government claim that lack of provisions had been the main
                                cause of withdrawal.</p>
                            <p>13. In connection with the fighting on the southeastern front the
                                Ethiopian Government and British Legation deny most emphatically
                                that assistance of any kind had reached the Abyssinians from Kenya.
                                See Department’s telegrams numbers 16, January 24, 6 p.m. and 18,
                                January 25, 1 p.m.<note n="17" xml:id="d46fn17">Neither
                                    printed.</note> On the contrary, I learn on good authority that
                                British planes patrolling border are often taken for Italian and
                                fired upon by Abyssinian forces and over 300 of Desta’s men who
                                crossed into Kenya were immediately disarmed and interned.</p>
                            <p>14. Latest reports from the south seem to indicate that Graziani is
                                now preparing thrusts up the Ganaledoria and Webishebeli to Conrad
                                on Joshualo headquarters of Dejazmatch Bay ana Merid who recently
                                defeated an Italian force near Imi capturing 6 tanks and 9 machine
                                guns.</p>
                            <p>15. Summarizing in conclusion my own impressions since last October,
                                I should say that the limited extent of Italian achievements so far
                                must have greatly lessened Rome’s hopes of forcing a decision before
                                the real rainy season begins in May. The prospects of the long
                                obstinate struggle which might require further tremendous sacrifices
                                in <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0113"/>money and human lives and
                                end after all in a stalemate stares the Italian Government in the
                                face. Unless its armies can win a smashing victory and occupy Addis
                                Ababa, it will have to prepare for another year’s campaign which
                                would imply keeping the huge Italian army under tents during 5
                                months of tropical rains, immobilized in a sea of mud and between
                                unfordable mountain torrents. Considering that the cost of
                                campaigning in Abyssinia is reported to amount to about 50,000,000
                                American dollars a month, the strain on Italian economic and
                                financial resources, not to mention their morale, is likely to
                                become unbearable. There are persistent rumors here that Mussolini
                                would be more favorably disposed to consider compromise suggestions
                                but I am perfectly certain that the only peace proposals the Emperor
                                would today be willing to consider seriously would spell the end of
                                the whole Fascist regime in Italy.</p>

                                regarding the Italian campaign in Abyssinia and related
                                subjects.</p>
                            <p>Contrary to predictions, the much discussed new offensive in the
                                Abyssinian campaign began from the northern rather than from the
                                southern front. Territorially the advance was modest, only about 16
                                miles being gained, but from a military point of view the victory is
                                heralded as being the most important of the war, so far. Besides
                                defeating a large Abyssinian army with heavy losses, which Italian
                                estimates place as high as 20,000 including killed and wounded, the
                                Italians are now in a strong strategic position near the approach to
                                the gorge of Mai Mesci [<hi rend="italic">Ma Meshik?</hi>] on the
                                road to Addis Ababa.</p>
                            <p>According to reports from Addis Ababa appearing in the Italian press,
                                a council of war is being held in the Ethiopian capital which, it is
                                suggested, may result in the adoption of a radically different plan
                                of defence for the northern front. On the southern front aviation
                                has been active in bombing and dispersing enemy concentrations but
                                no new territory has been occupied. It is supposed that General
                                Graziani is waiting for his new reenforcements to arrive before
                                attempting any further advance.</p>

                                in the North and that Italian claim that Amba Alagi has been taken

                                about to take place. Ethiopian people have never been more firm in
                                their support of the Emperor’s decision to decline all negotiations
                                which do not respect letter and spirit of League Covenant.</p>
                            <p>Italian report that Ras Desta has been dismissed in disgrace and
                                deprived of his titles and honors is without foundation.</p>
                            <p>Five thousand Azebo Galla tribesmen to whom the Italians had given
                                money, arms and munitions to induce them to revolt against the
                                Ethiopian Government have come to General Headquarters with their
                                arms and equipment and have expressed to the Emperor their devotion
                                to him and the common cause.</p>
                            <p>On March 16th seven Italian bombers dropped on Korem explosive and
                                gas bombs but without causing victims.</p>

                            <p>176. On March 21, Governor of Addis Ababa communicated to me text of
                                a notice he had published calling upon Ethiopians to maintain their
                                reputation for hospitality and courtesy by not showing any hostility
                                [to] “foreigners who live among us as our friends” and who are
                                engaged in peaceful work either in the capital or interior. The
                                enemy are only the Italians who are attacking the country. Anybody
                                threatening, insulting, or otherwise offending a foreigner will be
                                severely punished.</p>
                            <p>The above is evidently merely a precautionary measure as no
                                foreigners have so far been molested.</p>

                            <p>197. Five Italian planes bombed Addis Ababa at 7:30 this morning.
                                Principal objective was flying field about 4 miles outside city
                                where one Ethiopian plane was completely destroyed. No bombs dropped
                                in town itself nor on wireless station and apparently no casualties
                                anywhere.</p>
                            <p>In driving through streets during the raid I saw no signs of panic
                                and the police were at their posts as usual.</p>

                                accidentally killed and a number wounded by stray bullets
                                promiscuously fired at the planes by soldiers and civilians. Many
                                natives and some foreigners are making preparations to leave the

                                of your telegram and furnished him a list of the names of the

                            <p>As regards the first paragraph, the British Ambassador called on me
                                this morning to request that I join him in representations to the
                                Italian Government stating that the Belgian, French and German
                                Governments had agreed to do so but that he had not approached
                                Egypt. He also said Lindsay had been instructed to request from you
                                instructions for me to join.</p>
                            <p>I replied that Suvich last fall had given me definite assurance of
                                their intention to abstain from bombing those open cities (see my

                                        p. 895</ref>.</note>); that there had been no violation of
                                that as far as known and the Ambassador himself agreed that the
                                bombing of the airfield at Addis Ababa and the destruction of two
                                planes there was a legitimate operation; that to revert to the same
                                proposal and to again request assurances would indicate that my
                                Government had no confidence in the original assurances of the
                                Italian Government; that was not the case with my Government; and
                                that I thought it advisable to refrain from casting doubt upon the
                                intentions of the Italian Government in the premises by making
                                renewed representations.</p>

                                of bombing of Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa since the assurances given
                                last October on that subject may be considered to stand. Press
                                reports indicate that British Ambassador requested and received from
                                Italian authorities assurances that those two cities would not be
                                subject to bombing.</p>

                                other words it seems unlikely that the total effective Abyssinian
                                fighting force on both fronts ever exceeded 350,000 armed men.</p>

                                <item>Abyssinian tactics during the first 4½ months of the war had
                                    dampened Italian hopes of an early and decisive victory and the
                                    slow and hesitant operations must have caused disillusionment in
                                    Rome. And considering that the diminishing prospects of forcing
                                    the decision before the beginning of the heavy rains caused
                                    Mussolini’s very fate to hang in the balance because of the
                                    steady deterioration of Italy’s economic and financial situation
                                    it is hardly surprising that the Italian High Command [apparent
                                    omission] to make some spectacular advances even at the risk of
                                    sacrificing sound strategy. The all-important consideration was
                                    to impress an impatient public at home and a hostile or at least
                                    sceptical public opinion abroad.</item>

                                <item>Events of the past 6 weeks have proved that the decision to

                                    Italian claims too literally there can no longer be any doubt
                                    that the fortunes of war have turned definitely in favor of the
                                    Italians. After hammering the Ethiopians continuously since the
                                    middle of February, Marshal Badoglio evidently succeeded in
                                    striking a series of crushing blows which put the bulk of the
                                    Ethiopian armies in the north out of the field.</item>

                                <item>It will be recalled that by the beginning of February the
                                    Italian position at Makalle had become precarious and although
                                    the Abyssinians had not succeeded in cutting Makalle entirely
                                    off from Adigrat they were preparing to besiege it or
                                    endeavoring to take it by a frontal attack as evidenced by some
                                    sharp skirmishes which took place in its immediate vicinity. In
                                    trying to meet this threat from Ethiopian columns converging on
                                    Makalle, the Italian commander in chief decided to lengthen his
                                    unduly short base line by ordering a general [apparent omission]
                                    in three main columns.</item>

                                <item>The Italian left wing consisted of the First and Third Army
                                    Corps (both mostly white troops) and to them was assigned the
                                    task of clearing the main road leading south from Makalle. They
                                    were opposed by Ras Mulugeta, the Minister of War, who is
                                    understood to have commanded Ethiopia’s largest and
                                    best-equipped army including the Imperial Guard. After some
                                    fierce engagements which lasted 3 or 4 days, the Italians
                                    succeeded in storming of Amba Aradam massif in the Enderta
                                    region on February 15. Mulugeta’s army fled and although I
                                    understand that some 15,000 men under Dejazmatch Mashesha
                                    withdrew in good order, no attempt appears to have been made to
                                    make a stand. Aderat is said to dominate the region between
                                    Antalo and Amba Kasi.</item>

                                <item>It is said that a false report of the Emperor’s death which
                                    had been spread by the Italians among the Abyssinian soldiers
                                    during the attack on Amba Aradam caused several minor leaders to
                                    retreat even before an Italian success seemed certain. However
                                    that may be, no serious resistance was encountered by the
                                    invaders and on February 28 they even took Amba Kasi some 25
                                    miles south of Amba Aradam with practically no opposition.
                                    Considering that Kasi was Ethiopia’s strongest natural bulwark
                                    in the north and had many prepared gun emplacements and
                                    entrenchments, it had been expected that the relatively
                                    well-equipped forces of Ras Mulugeta and Dejazmatch Wodaju would
                                    make a determined stand there. Why this was not done is not
                                    clear for the surrender without argument of such an important
                                    stronghold could hardly be called a strategic retreat. It may be
                                    that hostile Azebu Galla tribesmen chose that moment to attack
                                    the Ethiopians in the rear. Also about that time Mulugeta died
                                    of pneumonia or some say was killed in a fight with these
                                    tribesmen.</item>

                                <item>The Emperor arrived at Quoram from Dessie on March 4 and took
                                    personal command of operations. By the end of March he had
                                    apparently rallied enough troops not only to stop the Italian
                                    advance but to counterattack. This he did on March 31 at Maichio
                                    (ceo [<hi rend="italic">Mai Cio</hi>] on Italian maps) some 20
                                    miles south of Kasi. But although the Ethiopian army is reported
                                    to have fought very well, it was beaten off with heavy losses.
                                    The attack failed and the Emperor was obliged to withdraw south
                                    with the remnants of his forces. Since then the Italians,
                                    reinforced by the Fourth Army Corps, have occupied Quoram April
                                    5 and are now believed to be at Cobbo about 125 miles north of
                                    Dessie.</item>

                                <item>While these operations were in progress, equally important
                                    developments took place in the center. The victory at Amba
                                    Aradam having given the Italians control of the main passes to
                                    the Tembien region, Badoglio left the First Army Corps to form
                                    the extreme eastern flank of his army along the edge of the
                                    plateau and sent most of <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0121"
                                    />the Third Army Corps and the native Eritrean Corps into the
                                    Tembien where Ras Kassa and Ras Seyoum evidently intended to
                                    give battle, although Kassa had always recommended resistance
                                    further south. Kassa’s strongest position was near Mount Amba
                                    Warkamba just north of Abbi Addi and about 50 miles northwest of
                                    Makalle, while Seyoum’s forces are believed to have been
                                    somewhere near there. With the Italian occupation of Antalo and
                                    Mulugeta’s defeat, both Ethiopian leaders were in great danger
                                    of being cut off. They apparently realized this a little too
                                    late and suddenly found themselves caught on two flanks. The
                                    difficult Warkamba stronghold was successfully stormed by an <hi
                                        rend="italic">Alpini</hi> division about March 1, and the
                                    remainder of the Abyssinian forces were almost surrounded in the
                                    Andino region. Although Kassa and Seyoum managed to escape, it
                                    is not known how many of their troops succeeded in extricating
                                    themselves. It is feared that many of them were destroyed by
                                    intense artillery fire and aerial bombing.</item>

                                            type of army permits too little control from the center

                                considerations of transport or supplies should delay them.
                                Diplomatic Corps is making every effort to arrange for adequate
                                police during the interval between the departure of the Government
                                and the arrival of the Italian forces.</p>
                            <p>Diplomatic Corps has as yet taken no decision as regards procedure to
                                be followed in dealing with the authorities of the Italian army of
                                occupation but we shall discuss the subject at a meeting on Monday.
                                It occurs to me that the Department may wish to advise me briefly
                                regarding the technique adopted and approved by the Department with
                                respect to the relations between our Legation in Brussels and the
                                German military authorities before we entered the European war.</p>

                                of about 500 men, having left there immediately prior to the Italian
                                occupation. Latest reports indicate that Italians have not advanced
                                much beyond Dessie and the Ethiopians effectively destroyed
                                considerable portions of the road as they withdrew. Apparently
                                Italians made no attempts to pursue Crown Prince.</p>

                            <p>257. My 253, April 30. As the Emperor and Crown Prince are still
                                believed to be in the city reports are current that the Ethiopians
                                may make a last stand some 10 miles to the northeast. If true this
                                would almost certainly cause much confusion and perhaps suffering
                                besides serving no useful purpose. At a meeting of the Diplomatic
                                Corps this morning it was therefore suggested that we should each
                                individually and informally try to dissuade the Ethiopian Government
                                from taking any steps that might lead to fighting in the immediate
                                environs of the capital, basing ourselves solely on humanitarian
                                grounds and to protect our nationals.</p>
                            <p>The following principal leaders are understood to be here with the
                                Emperor: Ras Kassa, Ras Seyoum, Ras Getat and Fitor Aribirru. If
                                they decide not to fight they will probably leave with the
                                Government tomorrow for the Italians are now only about 50 miles
                                from here.</p>

                            <p>The Emperor said he was perplexed by the strange maneuvers of
                                European diplomacy and the half measures of the League. He realized
                                of course that the stage was set for another European war and that
                                in the present confusion arising from Germany’s defiance of Locarno
                                Ethiopia’s fate is relegated to a secondary place. But he found it
                                difficult to understand British inconsistencies and France’s
                                inability to see that if Italy had been checked in time Germany
                                would never have dared to follow in her footsteps.</p>
                            <p>Ethiopia could easily have been saved by the application of oil
                                sanctions which would have forced Italy to abandon the war. He now
                                saw clearly that his faith in the League was not justified and that
                                though his advisers who had urged him to attack Italy before she
                                could complete her preparations had probably been right in this
                                country the powers had permitted everything to drift to such lengths
                                that a catastrophe was inevitable.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the possibility of a cessation of hostilities he said
                                that the thought of peace at any price was intolerable to him. He
                                had no intention of capitulating in the face of a premeditated
                                murderous assault and the rumors of his imminent departure from the
                                country were entirely baseless. He would remain and go on fighting
                                so long as one Abyssinian soldier was left to help him. But of
                                course he had always been and was now ready to submit to any peace
                                proposals within the framework of the League and the spirit of the
                                Covenant.</p>
                            <p>As I took leave the Emperor held my hand in his while he said,
                                “Convey my greetings to your President and tell him the fate of my
                                country may serve as a warning that words are of no avail against a
                                determined aggressor who will tear up any peace pacts whose terms no
                                longer serve his purpose”.</p>
                            <p>I was deeply moved by the whole interview and in submitting this
                                report I cannot help expressing the hope that when the proper time
                                comes it may be possible for us to exert such moral influence as we
                                possess in favor of an equitable settlement that upholds as far as
                                may be feasible international morality rather than international
                                crime. Having seen this nation and its ruler in their dire extremity
                                I cannot believe that Italy will be permitted to dictate terms based
                                solely on her recent victories. Surely the time has come for plain
                                speaking for if unilateral denunciation of treaties are tolerated
                                not only collective security but collective civilization will
                                receive a blow from which they may never recover.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of the Department’s instruction No. 55 of February 11,
                                    1936,<note n="38" xml:id="d70fn38">Not printed.</note> with
                                which the Department was good enough to enclose the Letter of Recall
                                of my predecessor and my own Letter of Credence as American Minister
                                Resident and Consul General to Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>Upon receipt of this instruction I addressed a Note (No. 38 of March
                                18, 1936) to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, transmitting a copy of
                                the President’s letter and requesting an indication of the time and
                                place which His Majesty the Emperor might wish to designate for the
                                presentation of my Letter of Credence. But as the Emperor had left
                                Addis Ababa for Dessie last November and had since then established
                                his headquarters even further north, I was verbally informed that an
                                audience would be arranged as soon as he returned to the
                                capital.</p>
                            <p>As stated in my telegram No. 214 of April 16, 11 a.m.,<note n="38"
                                    xml:id="d70fn39">Not printed.</note> it did not seem advisable
                                for me to seek an audience of the Emperor either at Dessie or
                                General Headquarters, so that I could only wait until I was informed
                                that His Majesty was in town.</p>
                            <p>This opportunity did not present itself until April 30, 1936, when
                                the Emperor—who had arrived clandestinely in the early hours of the
                                morning—sent for me at 6 p.m. This summons was all the more
                                unexpected as only very few people knew of the Emperor’s presence
                                because of the danger that Italian planes might take advantage of
                                the fact and bomb Addis Ababa. (See the Legation’s telegram No. 254
                                of April 30, 8 p.m.<note n="38" xml:id="d70fn40">Not
                                printed.</note>)</p>
                            <p>That the Emperor should have remembered my wish to present my
                                credentials and that he should have taken the time—amidst the
                                confusion which reigned and which presaged his last public
                                appearance—to receive me and to chat with me as if he had all the
                                time in the world, would seem to be the best proof that Haile
                                Selassie I is a very remarkable personage and deserves all the
                                encomiums that have been bestowed upon him.</p>
                            <p>I was received in private audience in one of the small throne rooms
                                of the Old Ghibby at 6:30 p.m. My conversation with the Emperor
                                lasted about twenty minutes and was reported in my telegram No. 259
                                of May 1, 10 p.m. I need only add here that our interview was in
                                French and, contrary to the Emperor’s usual practice, took place
                                without the aid of an interpreter.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                                reached the city. According to information supplied by the War
                                Ministry, however, Badoglio is not expected to enter Addis Ababa
                                until this evening or tomorrow morning but if necessary attempts may
                                be made to land troops in the city by airplane in spite of danger
                                from anti-air fire. It is understood that no instructions are being
                                sent to Badoglio as regards the measures to be taken upon the
                                occupation of the city as those matters are being left to his

                            <p>119. I am informed that in view of the reports of the situation in
                                Addis Ababa the French Ambassador here is making representations to
                                the Italian Government asking that the entrance of Italian troops
                                into Addis Ababa be expedited in order to restore order. The British
                                Ambassador has received no instructions to make similar
                                representations and in reply to an inquiry I have stated that this
                                Embassy has received no such instructions.</p>
                            <p>Foreign press correspondents who were received by Mussolini at noon
                                today following a ceremony report that he stated that Addis Ababa
                                had not yet been taken but that the entrance of the Italian troops
                                might be expected shortly. He added that the situation had changed
                                and that now foreign governments wanted the Italians to reach Addis
                                Ababa as soon as possible.</p>

                            <p>121. According to information obtained from War and Air Ministries
                                this morning no important military developments have taken place
                                during the last 24 hours in the Italian advance on Addis Ababa.
                                Askari troops are said to be in the neighborhood of the city and it
                                has even been reported that they have been there for several days.
                                The military authorities here state, however, that they are being
                                held there as a threat and will not enter the city unless conditions
                                there become desperate. It is also stated at Air Ministry that it
                                has so far been impossible to land plane in the city owing to
                                hostile gun fire and the conditions of the landing field. Badoglio’s
                                column of white troops is said to be held up by the destruction of
                                the roads and bridges and by the heavy rains and officers at War
                                Ministry would not commit themselves as to the time when he may be
                                expected to reach the city. According to reports received up to
                                present, Badoglio was about 30 miles from the city last night.</p>
                            <p>The impression continues throughout the city here that the capture of
                                Addis Ababa may be announced at any moment and that there may be
                                important declarations at the reopening of the Chamber this
                                afternoon.</p>

                            <p>129. Military Attaché who called at War Ministry at 5:30 this
                                afternoon was told officially that the white troops of Marshal
                                Badoglio’s column had reached the outskirts of Addis Ababa and were
                                being organized preparatory to the entry into the city tomorrow
                                morning. Unofficially it was stated that word had been received that
                                an Italian truck column of white soldiers had passed the British
                                Legation outside Addis Ababa on its way to the city and that this
                                column was being sent in advance to restore order.</p>

                                    printed.</note> with which there was enclosed a broadcast speech
                                by the Empress Mennen, I have the honor to transmit herewith, in
                                translation, two statements made to the Press by the Empress on
                                April 22 and 23, respectively, and one statement by Princess Tsahai,
                                her 17-year-old daughter.</p>
                            <p>The statements of the Empress are said to have been drafted in part
                                by the Emperor, while the one made by Princess Tsahai—who speaks
                                English and French quite fluently—is reported to embody almost
                                entirely her own ideas. All three are rather remarkable documents
                                and are forwarded to the Department as part of the documentary
                                history of Ethiopia’s most tragic hours. It is possible that they
                                are not readily available elsewhere as the government radio station
                                was so overburdened at the time that they may not have been
                                telegraphed in toto.</p>
                            <p>What the Empress and her daughter meant to convey—couched in the calm
                                and measured terms which have been so characteristic of all
                                Ethiopian official utterances during the conflict with Italy—was
                                that their country was war-weary from the struggle between utterly
                                unequal forces and that their poorly armed soldiers were being
                                annihilated by a great Power which had every advantage—including
                                poison gas—that science and modern equipment could provide.</p>
                            <p>In recording these last pathetic appeals for help from a proud and
                                ancient dynasty I cannot refrain from adding a few comments of my
                                own regarding the hopeless failure of the League of Nations to save
                                a member State.</p>
                            <p>While it was hardly likely that Ethiopia could expect complete
                                satisfaction from the League, even the most skeptical observers were
                                not prepared for the unedifying spectacle of seeing the League
                                supinely permit an aggressor nation to exterminate its victim. A
                                truly extraordinary situation has developed. Italy’s invading armies
                                have seized an enormous territory from a fellow-member of the
                                League; they have bombarded and destroyed some of Ethiopia’s largest
                                towns; they have killed tens of thousands of Ethiopian soldiers, and
                                many thousands of defenseless civilians—besides committing the
                                unspeakable atrocity of using poison gas against them; and they have
                                wrecked and burned millions of dollars worth of property. And yet no
                                practical assistance of any kind has been forthcoming under the
                                terms of the Covenant <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0134"/>of the
                                League which had been devised to cover precisely such a
                                situation.</p>
                            <p>Ethiopia has been bewildered by the fluctuating character of the news
                                from Europe. The attitude of the League and of the Powers
                                individually evidently underwent several changes, but each time
                                their policy appears to have become more conciliatory to Italy’s
                                aspirations. Instead of trying to prevent the war of aggression or,
                                if that proved impossible, to bring about a cessation of hostilities
                                at the earliest possible moment by a resolute stand in favor of more
                                stringent sanctions, the League seems to have been anxiously looking
                                about for some way out that would save its face. That this produced
                                a ludicrous discrepancy between fair words and real actions in
                                Geneva does not seem to have mattered to the governments represented
                                there.</p>
                            <p>A profound feeling of pessimism and disillusionment therefore began
                                to creep over Ethiopia when it became known that no oil embargo
                                would be imposed on Italy, even though it was obvious that a
                                complete embargo on the principal raw materials was bound to
                                strangle Italy and would have forced her to withdraw her troops from
                                East Africa. This was followed by the Hoare-Laval proposals<note

                                Flandin’s peace offer—both moves of singular ineptitude—which seemed
                                to be merely plays for time to delay as long as possible, and
                                ultimately to prevent, the application of an oil embargo without
                                interfering with Italy’s campaign in Ethiopia. All this
                                dilly-dallying played directly into the hands of Italy and
                                demonstrated the futility of a policy of sanctions as
                                faint-heartedly applied by the League. As far as Ethiopia was
                                concerned the League had practically ceased to function and the
                                recriminations between members of the League in the Ethiopian crisis
                                have made a mockery of the Covenant.</p>
                            <p>Small wonder then that Ethiopia felt herself betrayed and abandoned
                                by the whole civilized world. Being completely unable to understand
                                the cynical maneuvers of European diplomacy her faith has been
                                shaken in the sanctity of international law and morality. She sensed
                                dimly that the Powers were too preoccupied with the crisis in Europe
                                to defend a great international principle in the abstract, and that
                                so long as Ethiopia’s independence was not a vital national interest
                                to, say, Great Britain and France it was vain to hope that a
                                collective war would be waged against the peace-breaker. But even
                                the untutored mind of an Abyssinian must have grasped the truth that
                                if an instrument of so-called collective security cannot safeguard
                                peace in Asia or Africa it can hardly be expected to safeguard peace
                                in Europe. For it seems certain that if the path of the aggressor
                                had been successfully blocked in Manchuria and in Abyssinia, the
                                challenge of a remilitarized Germany could have been much more
                                easily met.</p>

                            <p>Whatever excuse the troubled atmosphere and the stark realities of
                                European diplomacy might furnish for running away in the face of
                                Mussolini’s defiance, the acquiescence of the world in a new and
                                unprovoked aggression is sure to have unpleasant repercussions.
                                Apart from the fact that the black races will wonder whether the
                                white man’s flexible idea of justice is quite honorable, Western
                                civilization cannot stand if the tearing up of treaties to satisfy
                                the fantastic whims of dictators is not checked. We—including the
                                United States—must all prepare to face the issue: so long as
                                ruthless nations in the Far East or in Europe can bank on the
                                pusillanimity of the law-abiding nations it is futile to expect the
                                dawn of a new era in international relations. The peoples of the
                                world are gradually realizing that a war of aggression is a wrong
                                inflicted upon the whole community of nations. But no abject
                                surrender to wrongdoing will ever make the world safe against the
                                organized and refined form of barbarity to which we have just been
                                treated in East Africa.</p>

                                <p>“In this, the most critical hour of my country’s history and
                                    while we are fighting against the most tremendous odds, I once
                                    more turn to the Press of the world in the hope of finding a
                                    channel through which we may state our case. There is yet time
                                    for those who desire justice to put an end to this most unjust
                                    of wars, this most immoral aggression against the rights of an
                                    independent and inoffensive people. All those who respect the
                                    principles which are intended to regulate the relations between
                                    nations must hide their heads in shame and indignation at the
                                    unfair and unequal treatment from which my country has
                                    suffered.</p>
                                <p>“For many months before the Italian Government began this war—but
                                    while its intentions were already clearly known—the transport of
                                    troops, war materials and munitions (including poison gas and
                                    aeroplanes) to the territories adjoining Ethiopia, was carried
                                    out on a large scale without a single practical effort on the
                                    part of any Power to prevent these flagrant preparations for the
                                    violation of international agreements.</p>
                                <p>“Nor is that all. For while Italy was thus arming, Ethiopia
                                    herself was denied by an embargo imposed by the other powers the
                                    right to arm herself for her own defense. And even after a
                                    criminal act of aggression by Italy this embargo remained in
                                    force. The result was that our soldiers were obliged to leave
                                    for the front—where they had to meet a heavily armed enemy—only
                                    inadequately equipped <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0136"
                                    />with rifles, many of which were obsolete, and with swords,
                                    spears, and even sticks. The raising of the arms embargo came
                                    much too late to enable our armies to receive the equipment and
                                    military supplies at a time when they would have been most
                                    effective in enabling us to meet the attack.”</p>

                                <p>“Even after the League of Nations had unanimously denounced Italy
                                    as the aggressor, Ethiopia experienced innumerable difficulties
                                    in securing the arms and munitions to which she had an
                                    indisputable right.</p>
                                <p>“And yet, notwithstanding the overwhelming superiority of
                                    equipment of the Italian armies, the latter failed for many
                                    months to make any notable advance against our soldiers. The
                                    Ethiopian soldier made up for his inadequate arms by his bravery
                                    and skill as a warrior. Even machine guns and tanks were
                                    overcome and captured and heavy aerial bombardments did not stop
                                    our advance or break our front.</p>
                                <p>“It was only when the enemy resorted to that most devilish of all
                                    means of attack, by dropping poisonous and corrosive gases from
                                    the air—indiscriminately upon men, women, children and
                                    cattle—was he able to break through our lines and to secure any
                                    advantage.</p>
                                <p>“The enemy has won his advantage by means which are not only the
                                    foulest affront to humanity, but are a violation of the
                                    international agreements which he had signed with other Powers.
                                    Even if the sufferings of our defenseless people do not arouse
                                    compassion to the extent of bringing about action to stop this
                                    horror, the flouting of solemn treaties should surely be a
                                    ground for such action by all. Today the enemy is raining the
                                    foul products of his civilization on the hamlets of our distant
                                    country. What assurance is there that a similar terror will not
                                    soon descend upon the populous cities of Europe?</p>
                                <p>“Only collective agreement can protect the nations against
                                    aggression such as we are now suffering. My country is fighting
                                    for the independence to which she is entitled and which is
                                    guaranteed by the Covenant of the League of Nations, of which
                                    she is a member. We are not yet defeated and, come what may, we
                                    shall use every weapon we possess in defending to the end our
                                    just cause.</p>
                                <p>“Proud of our armies and the noble struggle our entire people is
                                    making, I ask for assistance by the enforcement of agreements
                                    which the justice of our cause demands. The postponement of
                                    action, on whatever grounds, at this decisive moment has the
                                    effect of favoring our enemy. We regret that even today the
                                    consideration of the application of further sanctions is being
                                    opposed by certain members of the <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72"
                                        facs="0137"/>League of Nations. I therefore appeal to
                                    France, the emblem of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, and to
                                    Great Britain, the defender of Freedom and Justice for all
                                    races, and to the whole world to abandon all further delay in
                                    saving my country from her ruthless adversary.”</p>

                                <p>“In the name of Heaven, do help us! Get something done that will
                                    really harm the Italian armies and not merely the Italian
                                    people. I wish you would make use of your numbers and power to
                                    organize mass meetings and prepare petitions in all parts of
                                    every country. Rally your brothers and sons and induce them to
                                    use their massed strength to oblige their Parliaments and rulers
                                    to take action.</p>
                                <p>“I do not ask you to do this for purely selfish reasons. No, we
                                    are only a small race. But I am seventeen and I know as well as
                                    you do, that if the world permits armies and gas to destroy my
                                    country and people, civilization itself will likewise be
                                    destroyed. We clearly have a common cause, you and I.</p>
                                <p>“Why, therefore, does not everybody do something to ward off this
                                    common danger to humanity, this agony and death by bombs,
                                    shells, and gas, before it entrenches itself in the world as it
                                    has here, presently, to spread with fatal effect to your homes
                                    and your menfolk, too? Italy’s aggression and her use of gas
                                    have set humanity a test. If you fail to help us now, we shall
                                    all perish together.</p>
                                <p>“If, instead of reading the papers and exclaiming how terrible it
                                    all is, you banded yourselves together and gave your governments
                                    no peace until they had taken effective action, you would surely
                                    get something done to save us all. That is why I urge you to
                                    hold meetings, send urgent petitions and write to all the
                                    leading men of your countries from Presidents, Chancellors, and
                                    Prime Ministers down. You should make your governments feel the
                                    weight of the power which is behind you. Keep on until they act,
                                    for they will have to take action. Only do be quick!</p>
                                <p>“They can, through their representatives, concentrate on Rome the
                                    odium of world contempt. They can, if made to through their
                                    representatives or the League, summon Rome immediately to
                                    destroy all its stocks of filthy gas in Africa, and then proceed
                                    and get the stocks destroyed in Europe and elsewhere. They can,
                                    if made to, call upon the League immediately through the
                                    Committee of Eighteen, to prevent the sale of war materials to
                                    Italy.</p>
                                <p>“All these things they could do quickly—but only if <hi

                                    we have but few modern weapons to help us, <pb n="73"

                                    if you do not help quickly with all your might, gas and
                                    aggression will have been found to pay, and will have taken such
                                    root in ‘civilized’ human conduct that you, too, will, like us,
                                    be overtaken by death.</p>

                                    have adopted. They may help, but obviously they alone are not
                                    enough. Therefore, in the name of Heaven, join together in
                                    getting something done that will really help us before it is too

                            <p>133. Foreign Office officials inform me that order has been
                                established in Addis Ababa and that all measures for the protection
                                of foreigners have been taken. They state that the details of the
                                provisional administration of the recently occupied territory have
                                not yet been determined but it is understood that all military
                                powers are vested in Badoglio and that Bottai, Governor of Rome, who
                                is with the Italian forces, has been named a frontier governor to
                                administer the city of Addis Ababa.</p>
                            <p>In the course of conversations with Foreign Office officials the
                                information was volunteered that although the chiefs of mission at
                                Addis Ababa could not be recognized as accredited representatives
                                they and the members of their legations would be given diplomatic
                                privileges as a matter of courtesy and such facilities as are usual
                                in the case of a military occupation. The officials added that as a
                                matter of practice the diplomatic representatives there would have
                                the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> status of consuls and that the
                                situation was simplified by the fact that many of the diplomatic
                                officers in Addis Ababa had consular rank also.</p>

                            <p>135. The Italian Government official newspaper agency reports that
                                order has been restored in Addis Ababa. A police force of
                                Carabineers, <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0139"/>infantry and
                                fast motor units has been created, the local police have been
                                organized under Italian command, Italian guards have been stationed
                                around the French and American Legations at their request. All
                                legations have been found intact. A war tribunal was instituted, all
                                undesirable elements are being eliminated, supplies are being
                                organized through shipments from Djibouti and utilization of local
                                stocks. All auxiliary units of the motorized columns as well as the
                                Eritrean forces have entered the city. Relations between the Italian
                                authorities and Europeans as well as natives are reported
                                excellent.</p>
                            <p>Press editorials continue to stress the fact that Ethiopia is now
                                Italian and as such would be defended against any contestant, that
                                there is no question of any negotiations with the Negus and that
                                peace prevails to the deep satisfaction of the natives. There is no
                                mention of reported Italian diplomatic representations to London and
                                Paris or discussion of the form of government to be imposed.</p>

                                Ethiopian authorities depart. Harrar is expected to be in Italian
                                hands in a day or two.</p>

                                just experienced in Addis Ababa. British Consul at Harrar with guard
                                of 20 Somalis is endeavoring protect foreign nationals or evacuate
                                them to Diré Dawa. No Americans at or near Harrar.</p>

                            <p>322. While we were at the British Legation on May 5, the Minister
                                informed me in strict confidence that the Emperor had sent for him
                                the same day, he following me, <hi rend="italic">id est</hi> April
                                30 (see my 254, April 30, 8 p.m.<note n="42" xml:id="d80fn42">Not

                                would shortly be leaving for Palestine. I gathered from Sir Sidney’s
                                remarks that it was then intimated to the Emperor from London that
                                he could probably best serve his country by leaving with his family
                                and proceeding not only to Palestine but also to Europe. This
                                suggestion was accepted and on May 4, entire imperial family
                                embarked in Djibouti on H.M.S. <hi rend="italic"

                                London preparatory to laying his case before the League is not
                                supported by the Foreign Office. If officially discouraged he will
                                apparently take a house here giving ill health as reason for
                                nondeparture. Can now confirm that London ordered that there be no

                                the honor to transmit herewith a copy of an editorial article
                                entitled “Into Exile” which appeared in the <hi rend="italic"

                                unusually good picture of the character and spirit of the Emperor
                                Haile Selassie. These views are shared by practically every
                                fairminded person that has had the privilege of coming in contact
                                with him.</p>
                            <p>In order to complete the records of the Department in this connection
                                I am also quoting below what is probably the last public utterance
                                of the Emperor before he went into exile. It was made to the Press
                                on April 30th, the day he received me: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Do not the peoples of the world yet realize that by fighting
                                        on until the bitter end I have not only been performing my
                                        sacred duty towards my own people, but have been standing
                                        guard in the last citadel of collective security? Are they
                                        so blind that they cannot see I have been facing my
                                        responsibilities to the whole of humanity?</p>
                                    <p>“I wanted with all my heart to hold on until my tardy allies
                                        appeared. But if they never come then I say to you
                                        prophetically and without a trace of bitterness ‘the West is
                                        doomed’”.</p>

                            <p>A truly great ruler and a polished Oriental gentleman has passed from
                                the scene of world politics, and it will be extremely difficult to
                                find his equal among the backward peoples who are striving toward
                                progress and enlightenment.</p>

                                he had to send two regiments back from Addis Ababa to keep the road
                                open. There has also been a serious attack on Italian troops at
                                Addis Alam 25 miles west of the capital. Marshal’s son <pb n="77"

                                    [<hi rend="italic">Lalibela?</hi>]. I also learn that advance to
                                Lake Tsana was made with only 4,000 men which is of course utterly
                                insufficient for any effective occupation.</p>
                            <p>I, therefore, doubt very much whether the Italians can move large
                                forces into the southern provinces where most of our missionaries
                                are until after the next rainy season by which time I fear that
                                entire area comprising over a third of the Empire will have fallen a
                                prey to brigandage and rapine.</p>

                            <p>226. Following observations submitted by Major Fiske, Assistant
                                Military Attaché to the Embassy, who has just returned from a 2
                                months’ tour of Ethiopia.</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“There is no organized armed resistance to the Italian forces.
                                    All of the Tigre and the major portion of Gojjam including
                                    Gondar, Lake Tana [<hi rend="italic">Tsana?</hi>] and Debra
                                    Marcos, is quiet and completely under Italian administrative
                                    control. The Ogaden is likewise completely pacified and is
                                    returning to normal. The Wallo for a time caused considerable
                                    trouble. The local chiefs refused to surrender to the Italians
                                    and kept up a rather effective resistance sniping and raiding
                                    truck columns and isolated working parties. This resistance has
                                    now been put down and the Wallo too is returning to normal. This
                                    country is on the direct air route between Addis Ababa and
                                    Asmara and recently even the firing at airplanes has ceased.</p>
                                <p>Harrar, Dire Dawa and Jijiga have been occupied and the
                                    commercial life of the cities restored but some remnants of Ras
                                    Nasibu’s army are still in the mountains north of Harrar and
                                    west of Harrar and are interfering with the road building and
                                    with the traffic on the roads between Jijiga, Harrar and Diré
                                    Dawa. While I was there a raiding party struck an engineering
                                    detachment working on a bridge between Harrar and Jijiga killing
                                    6 and wounding 20. The military governor of this region General
                                    Nasi has recently taken over at Harrar. He has a division of
                                    Libyan troops and I believe that he will soon be able to force
                                    the disarmament of the few remaining guerrillas.</p>
                                <p>The area about Neghelli north of the Kenya frontier is not as
                                    quiet now as it was several months ago. The Italians have a
                                    force of about 15,000 men at Neghelli and this force has to be
                                    constantly on the alert to protect itself and to protect the air
                                    field which is about 20 kilometers from Neghelli. Movement
                                    between the air field and the town of Neghelli a distance of 20
                                    kilometers is made only under escort. General Geloso has been
                                    appointed military governor of the Galla and Sidamo area and is
                                    preparing this force at Neghelli for movement into the Lake
                                    country to complete its pacification. At the same time another
                                        <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0143"/>column from Addis
                                    Ababa is to be moved southwest on Jiren (in Jimma). Operations
                                    from Neghelli will probably be directed first upon Mega on the
                                    Kenya frontier and then north on Allata. These movements will be
                                    made regardless of rain and as soon as the necessary supplies
                                    can be gotten up.</p>
                                <p>The Italian forces at Neghelli and also at Harrar and at Gondar
                                    have been preparing for possible action against the Kenya,
                                    British Somalia, and the Sudan in the event that the Suez Canal
                                    should be closed but now that the possibility of continued
                                    sanctions against Italy seems rather remote they can devote
                                    their entire efforts to the immediate task of pacification and
                                    in my opinion it will not take them very long to accomplish it
                                    probably not more than 2 or 3 months”.</p>

                                Captain John Meade, for several months our Military Attaché at Addis
                                Ababa. You will not, of course, wish to take the time to read this
                                report in full, but the following points may be of interest:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">One</hi>. Captain Meade states that the size of the
                                Ethiopian forces has been greatly exaggerated. He estimates the
                                total number of Ethiopians in the field at 118,000. This is a mere
                                fraction of the estimates which have been received from other
                                sources. In view of the small number of troops available it is
                                perhaps not surprising that the Italian forces, which consisted of
                                half a million men, were able to reach Addis Ababa at such an early
                                date.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Two</hi>. Captain Meade gives a graphic picture of
                                the complete lack of training of the Ethiopian forces and the woeful
                                absence of equipment and supplies.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Three</hi>. Captain Meade in more than one place in
                                his report definitely establishes the use of poison gas by the
                                Italians. Thus, on pages 24–25 he writes as follows: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The Ethiopians themselves used no chemical agents, not even
                                        the simplest, such as smoke or poisons. The effect of gas
                                        from Italian bombs was very marked, largely due to the
                                        ignorance of the native soldiers. As far as I know, mustard
                                        gas was the only type used, and although it was effective,
                                        it was not so persistent as might be expected. This may be
                                        attributed to the rare atmosphere, and the very hot sun of
                                        the Ethiopian climate. All gas observed was dropped in
                                        bombs, although there were uncorroborated stories of it
                                        being sprayed from airplanes.”</p>

                            <p>Captain Meade points out that since the Ethiopians lacked the ability
                                to drive enemy planes away they soon learned the necessity of
                                dispersion as a means of preventing heavy casualties. He goes on to
                                say: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“… This is the principal reason why up to the time Italy
                                        began to use gas, very few Ethiopian casualties were caused
                                        by bombs. The rate of casualties by gas bombs was at first a
                                        good deal higher than it became later. This was caused by
                                        the ignorant desire of the Ethiopians to examine the hole
                                        made by a gas bomb where it had detonated. They afterward
                                        learned of the persistent effect of mustard gas around such
                                        a crater. It seems that the effectiveness of mustard gas in
                                        this war was less than might be expected in America or in
                                        Europe. There are two possible explanations for this. In the
                                        high altitude near the Equator, where the sun is very hot
                                        and the atmosphere very dry, the rate of evaporation is so
                                        high that effective concentrations are not maintained for a
                                        sufficiently long time. The Italians got no advantage from
                                        the foggy days in the mountain valleys, because they did not
                                        fly in such weather, and did not use artillery to produce
                                        gas concentrations. Another reason for what I consider to be
                                        the comparatively few casualties is the extraordinary
                                        physical resistance of the Abyssinian soldier to vesicants.
                                        I have seen men still carrying on with burns or wounds that
                                        would certainly incapacitate if not kill a white man. I
                                        believe they are also excessively resistant to lung and eye
                                        irritants as the result of their habitual life in
                                        smokefilled dirty tuculs whose only ventilation is the door
                                        opening.”</p>

                            <p>His final comments with respect to the use of gas read as follows:
                                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“It is my opinion that of all the superior weapons possessed
                                        by the Italians, mustard gas was the most effective. It
                                        caused very few deaths that I observed, but it temporarily
                                        incapacitated very large numbers and so frightened the rest
                                        that the Ethiopian resistance broke completely. It is
                                        possible that the Ethiopians could have lasted for at least
                                        two years had they pursued the delaying tactics recommended
                                        to them but they were sure to have lost in the end. They
                                        certainly did not help themselves by their refusal to listen

                                        had either been dismissed from the country or were virtual
                                        prisoners in Dessie or Addis Ababa. They were given no

                                    <p>“The future of Ethiopia cannot accurately be predicted. The
                                        first task the Italians have if they honestly intend to make
                                        a productive colony is the creation of a serviceable road
                                        net. Until this is done the country will remain savage and
                                        tied to pack transportation and it will also be necessary
                                        for the Italians to maintain a very large police garrison.
                                        After completing this road net success will depend on the
                                        method of administration adopted. If the success of a
                                        government may be measured by the contentment of the people
                                        governed, the Italians have so far failed to produce good
                                        colonial administration either in Eritrea or Tripoli. Tigre
                                        is full of people who have fled there from Eritrea because
                                        they were dispossessed of their property, or for other
                                        reasons. There, one hears many stories of the methods used
                                        by the Italian governors in running their districts which
                                        can only be described as atrocity tales. Regardless of the
                                        percentage of truth in these stories their existence
                                        indicates a social condition which is disturbing and
                                        unsatisfactory. General Graziani, now Viceroy of Ethiopia,
                                        has a well established reputation for excessively cruel
                                        administration of the natives of Tripoli.</p>
                                    <p>“It is my belief that future success in Italian
                                        administration of Ethiopia as a colony or possession must be
                                        based on a fundamental change in their methods. The
                                        Ethiopian is by nature too proud to accept an iron-handed
                                        government without objection, and he is sufficiently
                                        intelligent that contact with white men will instruct him in
                                        the more successful methods of revolt.”</p>

                                with the Italo-Ethiopian situation. Upon being asked the reason for
                                the apparent divergent views between the Ethiopian Government and
                                the Ethiopian delegation at Paris on certain of these matters, Mr.
                                Spencer said that this arose as a result of the disregard of the
                                Ethiopian Government’s instructions by Professor Jèze, Legal Adviser
                                to the Ethiopian delegation. He said that Professor Jèze was a very
                                opinionated person and that on more than one occasion he had altered
                                instructions which had been sent to him in presenting notes and
                                memoranda to the League and to other governments.</p>

                                contact the Emperor through Athens and Djibouti, as mentioned in a

                                attempt made to arrange a meeting between Ethiopian and Italian
                                emissaries at Athens, but they thought that efforts may have been
                                made by the Italians to contact the son of the Ethiopian Minister of
                                Foreign Affairs who was in Greece during the spring. Mr. Spencer
                                said that he knew something more of the attempt made through
                                Djibouti to bring about a meeting between Italian and Ethiopian
                                emissaries. Apparently the Italian agent was a certain Arab who
                                contacted Mr. Colson at Alexandria where he was then staying to
                                recuperate from over-work and illness. This contact was made late in
                                March, but for some unknown reason the Arab agent was unable to
                                obtain a visa to go to Addis Ababa. Nevertheless he evidently
                                continued his efforts to reach the Emperor and even tried to see him
                                after the Emperor had gone to Jerusalem. According to Mr. Spencer’s
                                information, this Arab agent had authentic credentials to make
                                preliminary negotiations. The basis of the negotiations was to be an
                                Italian protectorate over Ethiopia with the Emperor nominally
                                retaining his throne and being given a substantial civil list by the
                                Italian Government. Both of these efforts to establish contacts
                                ended unsuccessfully, with the results already known.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the departure of the Emperor from Addis Ababa on May
                                2, Mr. Spencer said that it had of course been known for some time
                                previously that the Italians would enter Addis Ababa some time
                                during the early part of May. Preliminary plans had been made to
                                move the Government to Goré in western Ethiopia, and Mr. Spencer had
                                even gone so far as to purchase animals with which to make the trip.
                                All during the week beginning April 27 Mr. Spencer and other
                                officials were prepared to leave on a moment’s notice, and with the
                                    <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0147"/>arrival of the Emperor in
                                Addis Ababa on April 29 it was expected that the date of departure
                                would soon be set. Mr. Spencer made efforts several times each day
                                during that week to find out the Government’s plans, but he was
                                always met with an evasive answer. In this connection he said that
                                the Ethiopian officials displayed the most appalling inertia in the
                                face of a most critical situation. When Mr. Spencer awoke on the
                                morning of May 2 he found that the Emperor had left by train at four
                                o’clock in the morning. This train had been prepared for the use of
                                the Empress, and the Emperor’s decision to accompany her to Djibouti
                                was evidently a sudden one. Asked as to who might have influenced
                                the Emperor to make the decision to leave the country, Mr. Spencer
                                said he was definitely of the opinion that this was brought about by
                                the Empress and by Ras Kassa.</p>
                            <p>At Geneva and later at London both Mr. Spencer and Mr. Colson urged
                                the Emperor to return to Ethiopia to continue the struggle. In this
                                connection Mr. Spencer said he felt that the British Government
                                might be able to put forward a plausible explanation if they
                                permitted the Emperor to return to Goré through the Sudan.
                                Apparently no decision had been made as to the Emperor’s movements
                                at the time Mr. Spencer left London about a week ago. To his last
                                inquiry as to whether the Emperor would return he was told “Maybe”,
                                which he interpreted as being “No”.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Spencer was definitely of the opinion that the rapid advance of
                                the Italians during the last few weeks of the war was due almost
                                entirely to their use of mustard gas and other poisons. He said that
                                the use of this gas began about March 1st, and that thereafter the
                                Italians had little difficulty in going forward. He stated
                                definitely that gas was sprayed from airplanes with most destructive
                                results. In addition, he asserted that he had been told by the
                                Emperor that the Italian forces had poisoned the waters of Lake
                                Ashangi near the Emperor’s field headquarters by dropping from
                                airplanes large barrels of poison. He felt that even if the Emperor
                                returned to Goré where there was a semblance of government he could
                                not hope to make any headway against the Italians as long as they
                                continued the use of poison gases.</p>

                            <p>Mr. John H. Spencer, formerly adviser to the Ethiopian Ministry of
                                Foreign Affairs, told me yesterday that the Anglo-Ethiopian Boundary
                                Commission, which was surveying territory in the vicinity <pb n="83"
                                    xml:id="pg_83" facs="0148"/>of the Ethiopian-British Somaliland
                                boundary at the time of the Wal Wal incident in 1934, was
                                established as a result of lengthy secret negotiations between Great
                                Britain and Ethiopia. On the Ethiopian side these negotiations were
                                carried out in large part by Mr. Everett Colson. The negotiations
                                were unknown to any of the other foreign advisers in Ethiopia and
                                were equally unknown to all but a few high Ethiopian officials.
                                According to Mr. Spencer the negotiations envisaged the transfer of
                                a large area of Ethiopia to British Somaliland. I asked Mr. Spencer
                                if these very negotiations might not have been the factor which
                                precipitated the Wal Wal incident. In this connection I pointed out
                                that if the Italians had any information that the British were
                                actually seeking to obtain Ethiopian territory they (the Italians)
                                might have felt that it was necessary for them to take immediate and
                                drastic action to prevent such a cession. Mr. Spencer said that this
                                was the natural conclusion, but he seemed to doubt whether the
                                Italians were actually aware of the negotiations. However, in view
                                of the excellent Intelligence Service which the Italians maintained
                                in Ethiopia, it is hardly possible that they would not have known of
                                such negotiations.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Spencer also stated that on at least two occasions prior to the
                                Wal Wal incident the Emperor had endeavored to induce the British
                                Government to declare a protectorate over Ethiopia with his (the
                                Emperor’s) concurrence.</p>

                                the results of the debates in the American Congress in order to see

                                and Léger said that the French Ambassador in London was of the
                                opinion that Eden felt it absolutely essential to ascertain whether

                                oil. He said that de Laboulaye<note n="58" xml:id="d93fn58">André de

                                been instructed to ask for information on the attitude of the
                                American Government in this matter. He seemed to feel that unless
                                the President were given some discretionary authority in the
                                application of embargoes there would be little hope of further
                                action in Geneva to increase or alter the present sanctions in force
                                against Italy.</p>
                            <p>Whether this would mean that the demands of the small powers for
                                increased severity against Italy which are apt to arise in Geneva

                                the question. The other appears from Léger’s comment to arise from
                                the French opinion that the Abyssinian venture from a military point
                                of view is a flat failure which is becoming increasingly evident
                                every day. He said that their information is to the effect that
                                motorization has utterly broken down in that area; that the wear and
                                tear on material, the difficulties of transporting sufficient motor
                                fuel and the great distances involved have apparently not been taken
                                into the Italian calculations so they now find themselves
                                unexpectedly engaged in hand to hand fighting in which they have no
                                advantage whatever over the Ethiopians. With this military set-back
                                Léger felt that Mussolini had at the same time utterly failed to
                                take advantage of any of the peace offers made to him and added that

                                change in regime when the facts become appreciated and if the powers
                                retain sufficient patience.</p>

                            <p>10. 1. As far as one can judge now the outlook of the former Minister
                                for League Affairs since he has assumed the greater responsibility
                                of the Foreign Office is tempering and he appears to be reaching the
                                conclusion that a negotiated peace is the practicable way out of the
                                impasse. I am informed that he is apprehensive of the increasing
                                menace of Germany.</p>
                            <p>2. There are at present no indications of a British intention to
                                reduce their fleet in the eastern Mediterranean or in the
                                Mediterranean as a whole. The Naval Attaché of this Embassy reports
                                that the tendency has been towards a slow increase to which the
                                prospective movements of the British and French fleets as announced
                                by the press yesterday are no exception. Specific reference is had
                                to prospective departure middle of January of <hi rend="italic"

                                from England for Gibraltar, ostensibly to relieve vessels there and
                                prospective departure of French second squadron from Brest 14
                                January for Atlantic cruise to arrive Casablanca 18 January and
                                prospective departure of French first squadron 20 January from
                                Toulon for Mediterranean maneuvers. These movements are the first
                                tangible manifestation of Anglo-French naval cooperation.</p>

                            <p>2. Important reinforcements of British mechanized military units
                                arrived in Egypt this week. I learn from reliable source that by the
                                middle of next month British troops in this country are expected to
                                be considerably in excess of existing strength. Divisional

                                    one year. See <hi rend="italic">Congressional Record</hi>, vol.

                                Committee is received with satisfaction. The Foreign Office
                                spokesman said editorially yesterday that while final decision
                                depends on Congress the amendment indicates that the United States
                                is not disposed to reverse its neutrality policy and to extend
                                embargoes to general trade with belligerents. “The oil question is
                                here sharply defined. For the moment there is no further talk of
                                limitation. And it is noteworthy that this definition follows upon
                                the intensive propaganda carried out in America by England who has
                                spared no means of influencing the United States to support her
                                policy to obtain an oil embargo.”</p>
                            <p>Such a policy, he says, would amount to indirect participation in the
                                war and would also be an act of partnership, in that it would affect
                                only a [<hi rend="italic">in?</hi>] part countries deprived of raw
                                materials and not those such as England, Russia and France. “It now
                                remains to be seen whether the sanctions committee at Geneva will
                                reflect the negative attitude of the United States or will attempt
                                to act independently. With or without oil sanctions Italy can
                                unquestionably provide for all her requirements. But it must once
                                more be stated that an oil embargo would extend sanctions from the
                                economic to the military sphere.” The arms and munitions embargo
                                even if partially applied can in a way be regarded as the
                                application of an international neutrality principle established
                                prior to and independent of the League; <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89"
                                    facs="0154"/>but an oil embargo would be an application of
                                League law exclusively and have a character of unconcealed
                                hostility. “In substance the alteration in the oil trade with Italy
                                while it would not change her military raids [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >sic</hi>] would represent a further alteration of League policy
                                in her regard and would thereby make a reconsideration of her

                                on the 20th, he expects no new proposals for peace, no oil embargo,
                                no extension of sanctions, but thinks it possible the League may
                                send a commission of inspection to Ethiopia. They expect very little
                                in the way of diplomatic development. He appeared to be perfectly
                                unconcerned about the movements of the British fleet. He said Italy
                                was withdrawing two more divisions from Libya for the expeditionary
                                force in East Africa. These would not be replaced in kind but a
                                smaller number of troops constituting a mechanized unit would be
                                sent to Libya instead of the two divisions departing.</p>
                            <p>The Naval Attaché has just returned from Taranto where is assembled
                                the larger part of the fleet. He reports a very high state of
                                efficiency and an entire preparation for any immediate emergency,
                                with a high morale amongst the men and a calm and unexcited attitude
                                on the part of the officers.</p>
                            <p>As a whole the officers of the Government and the people are calm,
                                composed, and determined to proceed with the African venture and
                                apparently not disturbed by any prospects of interference from
                                outside.</p>

                            <p>9. The outstanding characteristic of the Italo-Ethiopian question
                                from the Geneva point of view on the approach of the Council
                                meeting, is that among the various separate elements which govern
                                the situation there is as yet no emergence of a relationship in
                                terms of possible action.</p>
                            <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0155"/>
                            <p>1. The Secretariat position is that the matter of an oil embargo
                                should come up during the Council in contemporaneous meetings of
                                League bodies. I am told that the Secretariat plan is that
                                    Vasconcellos<note n="62" xml:id="d98fn62">Augusto Vasconcellos,
                                    Portuguese delegate to the League and Chairman of the Committee
                                    on Sanctions.</note> will inquire in the Committee of Eighteen
                                whether there are any objections to the extension of the sanctions
                                to oil, coal, iron and steel and that failing objections a date will
                                immediately be set for their going into effect.</p>
                            <p>The Secretariat had envisaged as a point of departure for such action
                                American neutrality legislation which they thought would become
                                effective before the convening of the Council. Now, however, feeling
                                that Congress may not have completed its action prior to these
                                meetings the Secretariat authorities describe the situation as more
                                “uncertain” and have inquired of me as to the action which the
                                League might best take to conform with or to have the most favorable
                                effect on American policy. I have naturally declined to comment on
                                this aspect of the question but merely reiterated the independent
                                character of American policy.</p>
                            <p>2. More general indications, however, point to the oil question not
                                being raised or at least that no definite material action will be
                                taken. It is possible that a committee will be appointed to consider
                                the matter. The situation suggests that Great Britain will not
                                desire, nor France permit an external excuse being presented to
                                Mussolini to take hostile action in the European sphere. The present
                                tendency would seem to be for the issue to remain static awaiting
                                material developments. This is governed partly by a growing belief
                                here derived from a number of sources that the tide has turned
                                against Italy, either that a substantial victory as a bargaining
                                point had become less probable or in any event even in the case of a
                                transient military success that the financial and economic state of
                                affairs [in] Italy together with the physical difficulties of the
                                campaign will prevent an attainment of Italian objectives. Should
                                material developments become substantially favorable to Italy a new
                                situation would in any event be presented.</p>
                            <p>3. I am inclined to believe that the procedures of the forthcoming
                                sessions of League bodies will be confined to giving technical
                                consideration to the degree of application of existing sanctions and
                                that these will remain in force. The problem is being more and more
                                discussed nevertheless as to whether failure to extend sanctions may
                                not have the psychological effect of producing a slackening in the
                                enforcement of existing sanctions in certain states with the
                                ultimate result of a dissolution of the system. In discussing the
                                matter with me various delegates are increasingly emphasizing the
                                material losses which their countries are sustaining in the
                                application of sanction measures.</p>
                            <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0156"/>
                            <p>4. On the other side of the picture is the question of the
                                commitments which Great Britain may have obtained from France and
                                from certain Mediterranean states under the mutual support
                                provisions of article XVI.<note n="63" xml:id="d98fn63">See footnote
                                    49, <ref target="#pg_141">p. 141</ref>.</note> Nothing definite
                                is apparently yet known here concerning the character and
                                significance of the recently reported London-Paris arrangements. The
                                Greek Minister tells me that he believes London’s <hi rend="italic"
                                    >démarches</hi> in Belgrade, Athens, and Ankara were along
                                identic lines. He does not know whether the replies were an
                                agreement in principle or envisaged specific action. In respect of
                                principle he believes that the replies mentioned paragraph 3 of
                                article No. XVI but that in each case special reserves were made in
                                some form respecting paragraph 2. On the material side he
                                understands that German trade relations have been established. The
                                important point remains, however, whether these developments have
                                the purpose of increasing the general pressure on Rome, whether they
                                are protective or whether they are steps in eventually forcing
                                military conclusions with Italy.</p>
                            <p>The Turkish and Yugoslav Ministers in their conversations with me
                                imply that Great Britain has granted certain trade compensations to
                                their states in association with the matter of mutual support.</p>
                            <p>The Spanish here are extremely reticent even as to whether London
                                made a similar <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> at Madrid. They state
                                that in any event their Government’s policy is not yet
                                formulated.</p>
                            <p>5. There are rumors that certain of the small states, Denmark and
                                Sweden being particularly mentioned, may support the Ethiopian
                                request for the despatch of a commission of inquiry (Consulate’s
                                number 2, January 7, noon). It does not seem probable, however, that
                                the League will take such action.</p>

                            <p>10. Continuing my No. 9, January 17, 3 p.m., I learn from an entirely
                                reliable source that a responsible Italian official here in private
                                conversations speaks frankly of the perilous situation in which he
                                believes his country is placed both through its internal situation
                                and in its military position in Ethiopia. He states that “as far as
                                he felt possible” he had urged Rome to accept the Laval-Hoare
                                proposals <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0157"/>as, on the
                                assumption that Addis Ababa would not accept them, at least offering
                                the tactical advantage of placing Ethiopia in the posture of
                                recalcitrance to a “peace move.” He deplores the continued policy of
                                Mussolini of presenting an optimistic picture to the Italian people
                                as inviting a greater catastrophe for Italy in their ultimate, and
                                in his mind, inevitable disillusionment.</p>
                            <p>Nothing definite emerges here respecting the various “peace
                                proposals” mooted in the press. However I am reliably informed that,
                                not to be confused with the Ethiopian request to the League for a
                                commission to investigate illegal warfare, Rome recently made
                                informal soundings in London and Paris for the setting up of a
                                commission on the order of the Lytton Commission<note n="65"

                                Sino-Japanese affair but that London refused to consider any plan
                                not including cessation of hostilities. This Italian move is
                                supposed to be linked in intent at least with the Laval plan of
                                procedure reported in my number 673, December 21, noon,<note n="66"
                                    xml:id="d99fn66">Not printed.</note> paragraph 3, and would
                                presumably be equally unacceptable here for the same reasons.</p>
                            <p>There are rumors that Mussolini is now really looking for a pretext
                                to back down even to the extent, it is asserted in some quarters, of
                                welcoming an oil embargo as offering the excuse that Italy cannot
                                combat the world.</p>
                            <p>If the situation of Italy is as adverse as is believed here I venture
                                to suggest that moves by London and Paris having as their possibly
                                disguised aim to “save” Italy may be looked for.</p>

                            <p>27. The series of Cabinet meetings, many of which were in conjunction
                                with the Committee of Imperial Defence, held during the past week,
                                have formulated the stand which Eden will take at Geneva. The
                                Foreign Secretary’s speech last night<note n="67" xml:id="d100fn67"
                                    >Speech made to the Engineering Employers Association at
                                    Warwick, January 17.</note> cast light on this position; for one
                                who in the past has spoken so loudly about the sanctionist aspect of
                                the League, Eden was eminently “safe”. In brief, he outlined a
                                League that must have elasticity as well as strength, and added that
                                in the immediate crisis “it would be helpful if the Council in near
                                future could review the situation, take stock of recent events, and
                                appreciate the point we have now reached”.</p>

                            <p>The British Government continues to be “the prisoner of its own
                                words” (see my 468, September 25, 2 p.m. and 510, October 10, 8
                                    p.m.<note n="68" xml:id="d100fn68">Neither printed.</note>).
                                Since the popular demonstration which caused Sir Samuel Hoare’s
                                resignation, it has been increasingly realized by those responsible
                                for British foreign policy that whereas the methods employed by
                                Hoare were faulty, the general aim of his policy was substantially
                                right.</p>
                            <p>As has been so often repeated from this Mission, the menace of
                                Germany constitutes the main preoccupation of the responsible
                                services of the Government. The politicians, although in agreement,
                                are nevertheless aware of the importance of the League of Nations
                                sentiments which have been evoked in this country, and are faced
                                with the problem of effecting a practical solution without offending
                                those sentiments. In fact Eden himself in a private conversation
                                remarked that the cooperation which he had been promised from
                                certain countries was “almost embarrassing” incidentally in view of
                                the fact that other countries were already beginning to seek their
                                pound of flesh from London in the Danzig situation. It will also be
                                noted that Eden’s speech contains no reference to sanctions. The
                                Foreign Office frankly states that it is apprehensive over the
                                French internal position, particularly in this connection, and it is
                                also emphasized that it cannot now be determined when American
                                neutrality legislation will be made effective by Congress and that
                                in any case Italy now has sufficient supplies of oil on hand to
                                carry her through the rainy season.</p>
                            <p>The growing importance in Eden’s mind of the German menace was
                                briefly referred to in my 10, January 9, 5 p.m., and he emphasizes
                                this in the opening lines of his speech when he refers to “the
                                emergence once more of a strong Germany claiming for herself the
                                right to rearm.” An analysis of his speech reveals a League policy
                                which stresses the importance of a collective policy, incidentally
                                to be used in the present crisis, but which purposefully is to be a
                                threat against a future aggressor, possibly Germany. Mr. Eden goes
                                on to emphasize that only through a collective system is the way
                                open to an arms agreement. In other words, he is preparing the
                                British public for the rearmament of Great Britain the full extent
                                of which can only be determined as the government and the popular
                                mind are able more and more to appreciate the weakness or strength
                                of the Geneva collective system. Such a statement from Eden should
                                satisfy public opinion, eliminates embarrassment to the politicians
                                and yet permits an immediate embarkation on all those phases of
                                rearmament that the Crown services are demanding.</p>

                                chief elements of the Ethiopian position. The note was apparently

                                the Ethiopian position in regard to past agreements among the powers

                            <p>My informant characterized the tone of the meeting as hesitating and
                                inconclusive both in respect of the more fundamental matters
                                discussed and in respect of the positions taken. Five aspects of the

                                financial assistance (Consulate’s 577, November 5, 11 a.m.<note

                                (Consulate’s 2, January 7, noon), (3d) the matter of conciliation,
                                (4th) the question of sanctions and [(5th)] mutual position of the

                                for technical reasons (the treaty<note n="75" xml:id="d103fn75"

                                Ethiopia had cited not being in force) and for political reasons.
                                    Bruce<note n="76" xml:id="d103fn76">S. M. Bruce, Australian
                                    delegate to the League.</note> pointed out that any entering
                                upon the path of assistance was extremely dangerous inasmuch as
                                Ethiopia might ask for financial assistance today and military
                                assistance tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>(2) The sending of a Commission of Inquiry on illegal warfare was
                                considered as not falling within the province of the League, the
                                statement being made that “the purpose of League was to stop a war
                                and not to observe a war”. Eden suggested that this might be
                                undertaken by some other organization perhaps the Red Cross.</p>
                            <p>(3) A lengthy discussion took place on the question of the
                                Committee’s functions with respect to conciliation at the present
                                time.</p>
                            <p>Madariaga<note n="77" xml:id="d103fn77">Salvador de Madariaga,
                                    Spanish permanent delegate to the League of Nations.</note>
                                pointed out that the only new information available since the last
                                meeting was that composed in the notes received from Italy and
                                Ethiopia. He inquired what the Committee should do with reference to
                                the matter raised in the Ethiopian note of January 20 (Consulate’s
                                19, January 21, noon).</p>
                            <p>Titulesco<note n="78" xml:id="d103fn78">Nicolas Titulesco, Rumanian
                                    permanent delegate to the League of Nations.</note> stated that
                                the Committee should decide whether its fundamental mission was one
                                of conciliation. Madariaga felt that the function of Committee was
                                to consider the whole affair. With this Eden agreed and stated that
                                in consequence they must consider if any <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96"
                                    facs="0161"/>possibility existed of taking an initiative to put
                                an end to the conflict. If there was the Committee should pursue it.
                                If not it should so state.</p>
                            <p>Titulesco agreed in principle but felt that it would be dangerous to
                                leave the impression with Italy that the whole question was again
                                under consideration which might imply that the League’s action in
                                declaring an aggressor and in enforcing sanctions was not a final
                                judgment. He felt that the work of the Committee was a matter for
                                the future and not for the past or present. In consequence the
                                Committee might report to the Council that it could not pronounce on
                                the Hoare-Laval plan which had not obtained the approval of the
                                parties and that it had no suggestions to make respecting
                                conciliation.</p>
                            <p>Beck<note n="79" xml:id="d103fn79">Joseph Beck, Polish Minister for
                                    Foreign Affairs, taking the place of the permanent Polish
                                    delegate on the Council.</note> agreed, feeling, however, that
                                the Committee should state that it was ready to consider all
                                proposals for conciliation.</p>
                            <p>Eden felt that the initiative in conciliation could not be taken by
                                the League which could only act in response to the two parties.
                                There was no material on hand for conciliating and the Committee of
                                Eighteen should pursue its work.</p>
                            <p>Laval disagreed entirely with Eden’s attitude. The position which he
                                had taken with Hoare in Paris in the evolvement of plan had not
                                changed. He did not wish to revive the plan but he wanted to make
                                clear that its purpose was to reach a conciliation before the
                                reenforcement of sanctions. He felt that the situation was precisely
                                the same as it was at the time of the plan and that it would be most
                                dangerous for the League to assume the position that the moment was
                                not opportune for conciliation.</p>
                            <p>(4) Eden stated that some order had to be established in the work of
                                the League on the relationship between the questions of sanctions
                                and mutual assistance and referred to the diplomatic conversations
                                which had taken place respecting the latter. He felt that the states
                                which had agreed to mutual assistance should present individually a
                                report to the Council for its information.</p>
                            <p>There was no response to this suggestion on the part of the other
                                members of the Committee but it was apparent from the attitude of
                                some that these remarks aroused uneasiness.</p>
                            <p>(5) Bruce discussed in particular the position of the League at the
                                present juncture. At the beginning of the conflict public opinion
                                felt that the League was only an ideal but was helpless in the face
                                of action taken by any great power. The application of sanctions had
                                changed opinion and it was felt that the League could accomplish
                                something for collective security. At present there was the question
                                in many minds whether an extension of the economic sanctions would
                                    <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0162"/>produce reactions which
                                would result in a new conflict. The League was thus faced by two
                                dangers, (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) public opinion of the world that
                                it could not stop the war, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) consequences
                                which might arise should the League apply the letter of the
                                Covenant. He suggested that great attention should be given to the
                                possible results of the application of slow pressure.</p>

                            <p>363. It seemed clear from the outset of this Council session that no
                                decisive action on the Italo-Abyssinian question could be expected
                                because of the sickness of the King followed by his death<note
                                    n="81" xml:id="d104fn81">George V of England, who died January
                                    20, 1936.</note> and because of Laval’s precarious situation
                                which has resulted in his resignation. On the other hand, the fact
                                emerged that since the Hoare-Laval episode had occurred immediately
                                before an anticipated decision on an oil sanction; and because
                                Mussolini had uttered threats against its application, the sanction
                                itself had become a symbol of the determination of the League,
                                vis-à-vis Mussolini. Hence, it was felt that something should be
                                done to demonstrate that the matter was still alive.</p>
                            <p>In discussing the setting up of an Expert Committee to examine the
                                efficacy of such a sanction, Eden said Litvinoff proposed to adjourn
                                the work of that committee until the attitude of “other producing
                                countries” could be ascertained. Eden said that this, of course,
                                meant the United States in the mind of his hearers and that he did
                                not want the committee to take any such action as would appear to be
                                predicated on that of the United States, and he feared that it might
                                be embarrassing to us. As the alternative, he urged that the
                                committee meet at an early date and examine the possibilities in the
                                light of different hypotheses. He hoped that Mr. Hull would
                                understand his motive in trying to avoid any action by the League
                                predicated on ours.</p>
                            <p>Aloisi tells me that he is making no wild statements about what will
                                be done if the oil sanction is applied but that if Italy feels
                                itself about to be strangled it will have to take violent measures
                                to prevent strangulation. There are evidences from other Italian
                                sources that the threat <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0163"/>of
                                hostilities in answer to the imposition of the oil embargo is being
                                less insisted upon. Eden feels that the application of this sanction
                                is really dependent upon the conclusions of the Expert Committee as
                                to its efficacy. Several of the delegates have told him they think
                                it essential to impose it if investigation shows its practicability.
                                In any case the delegates have no desire to hurry on this matter and
                                are all anxious to see the course of our neutrality bill before
                                determining their action. While they presumably will avoid direct
                                reference to American legislation, such legislation will,
                                nevertheless, be considered a basic factor in determining the
                                efficacy of a contemplated oil embargo. I believe that I sense a
                                diminution in the determination to “punish” Italy which raises some
                                doubt in my mind as to whether the oil sanction will be applied even
                                if found to be efficacious.</p>
                            <p>As to the possibilities of conciliation Aloisi tells me that he,
                                himself, recognizes that after the demonstration of the British
                                people on the Hoare-Laval proposal presumably neither Great Britain
                                nor France will be willing to take the initiative except through
                                League organs. Italy now recognizes that steps toward conciliation
                                must be made through the League, and his presence here now, he says,
                                participating in the normal work of the Council is an indication
                                that such procedure would not be displeasing to Italy. He expressed
                                the hope that after the French elections and the cessation of
                                hostilities through the beginning of the rainy season, public
                                opinion would be sufficiently modified to permit the initiation of
                                further efforts of conciliation. Under different phrases Eden and
                                    Massigli<note n="82" xml:id="d104fn82">René Massigli, Assistant
                                    Director of Political and Commercial Affairs in the French
                                    Foreign Office.</note> likewise expressed the hope that the
                                beginning of the rainy season may be a propitious moment.</p>
                            <p>It is difficult to see how conciliation will be possible even then. A
                                psychological chasm separates the British and Italian conception of
                                the situation. Aloisi is deeply bewildered by the British attitude.
                                As he analyses their motives, he completely leaves out of account
                                the universal condemnation of Italy’s aggression. He says, for
                                instance, “nobody could expect us to give up territory gained by the
                                expense of blood and treasure.” How such a conception can be
                                conciliated with the phrase in Eden’s speech on Friday last, “an
                                aggression must not be allowed to succeed,” is difficult to see.
                                Aloisi finds in Eden’s conversation a more moderate tone and
                                attaches some hope to this. I excuse his impression that the British
                                have so regularized their position in the Mediterranean through the
                                promise of military support from the Mediterranean states and their
                                own improved military preparations, that they are no longer rattled.
                                They regard with equanimity the continuance of the present situation
                                for a period and feel free to consider other problems.</p>
                            <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0164"/>
                            <p>The problem which most perturbs them is that of German rearmament.
                                The intensity of this rearmament now overshadows the immediate
                                question of Abyssinia in the minds of the French as well as the
                                British.</p>
                            <p>I have been struck in the last few days with the fact that nearly
                                everyone with whom I have spoken has treated the problem of Germany
                                with greater gravity than that of Abyssinia or, indeed, of the
                                status of the eastern Mediterranean. Both from Massigli and a member
                                of the French general staff, I learn that the French now desire
                                above all things to arrange a system of limitation with Germany.
                                Eden tells me that Laval is of the same mind. Massigli says that the
                                French are much concerned lest the Germans in the near future
                                denounce the servitudes on the Rhineland and that only prompt action
                                can head this off.</p>
                            <p>That an early initiation of disarmament discussions can be brought
                                about under present conditions seems improbable. Nevertheless, Eden
                                feels that at some stage they should put their cards on the table
                                with Germany; should tell the Germans that their present tempo of
                                rearmament causes grave concern; that other states have already
                                adopted measures to compete in building but that such competition
                                would be wasteful and dangerous; that they desire to undertake with
                                the resignation [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and examination of the
                                latter’s grievances in the hope of satisfying some of them; that
                                this is under the condition that Germany returns to the League for
                                the purposes of discussing limitation of armaments. Very
                                confidentially Eden tells me that he has ordered Phipps<note n="83"
                                    xml:id="d104fn83">Sir Eric Phipps, British Ambassador in
                                    Germany.</note> to London next week to discuss with him the
                                question of whether the time is ripe to make any overture to Germany
                                on the question of disarmament.</p>
                            <p>A conflict of opinion in respect to the effect on Germany of a show
                                of force as a phase of collective action is beginning to emerge.
                                Eden apparently feels that a demonstration of the determination of
                                peacefully minded states to meet force with force, if necessary,
                                will be a factor in inducing Germany to look favorably upon a
                                proposal to limit armament. However, in the minds of the unofficial
                                Germans here the military preparation of the League states coupled
                                with the development of the idea of collective military action,
                                which the Germans regard as a potential military alliance against
                                their country, constitutes a threat which Germany must resent and
                                answer by counter preparation in armament. Aloisi assures me there
                                is no understanding between Italy and Germany but he pointed out
                                that the transformation of the League through British influence into
                                a dooming alliance against Italy in the Mediterranean cannot fail to
                                present Italy and Germany as in the same camp. He believes the
                                states of <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0165"/>the League will
                                bend that instrument to military purposes against Germany as well as
                                against Italy. Hence, in the mind of the public, at least these two
                                countries will be thrown together.</p>
                            <p>I have thus treated summarily the impression resulting from a number
                                of conversations. I will report in greater detail by letter.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>; I have the honor to refer to the
                                Embassy’s despatch No. 2456 of January 11, 1936<note n="84"
                                    xml:id="d105fn84">Not printed.</note> (pages 14–15), in which
                                reference was made to the December 1935 Franco-British proposals for
                                a settlement of the Italo-Ethiopian conflict as well as to the
                                “leak” which occurred at the time in the columns of two prominent
                                French newspapers. A word as to the situation prior to Sir Samuel
                                Hoare’s arrival in Paris is perhaps relevant in recalling the status
                                of the negotiations then in progress.</p>
                            <p>It was commonly rumored in Paris that the Hoare-Laval plan had its
                                origin in Rome from where the Quai d’Orsay had been informed of the
                                minimum conditions which M. Mussolini would consent to accept as a
                                basis for negotiation. The Italian claims, however, appeared so
                                unreasonable that the scheme was dropped as being utterly
                                incompatible with League principles. When the question of the
                                embargo on oil became more acute the Italian Government, seriously
                                alarmed, instructed its Ambassador in Paris, Signor Cerruti, to call
                                upon M. Laval and to state in unequivocal terms that an embargo on
                                oil would mean war. The answer that M, Laval is reported to have
                                made to the Italian representative was that if Italy attacked the
                                British fleet in the Mediterranean France would come to England’s
                                help. The unexpectedly resolute attitude of the French Prime
                                Minister brought consternation to the Italian camp and the
                                Ambassador was sent post haste to M. Laval to inform him that Italy
                                would welcome any compromise suggestion that might forestall the
                                application of an oil embargo, especially since the United States
                                Government at that time showed a disposition to reduce its exports
                                of oil to Italy pending the passage of a Neutrality Act.</p>
                            <p>The French African expert at the Quai d’Orsay, M. de Saint-Quentin,
                                who was then working in close collaboration in Paris with his
                                “opposite number” in the British Foreign Office, Mr. Maurice
                                Peterson, proceeded to a hasty modification of the original plan <pb
                                    n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0166"/>which, in its final form,
                                met with the approval of certain members of the British Cabinet who
                                were opposed to the idea of an oil embargo on the grounds that such
                                a step would not only starve Italy but would break the Stresa front
                                against Germany, and thereby endanger the Fascist regime in Italy.
                                The plan in its final form was, to the best of the Embassy’s
                                knowledge and belief, ready on Thursday, December 5, and received
                                the approval of M. Laval and Sir Robert Vansittart,<note n="85"
                                    xml:id="d105fn85">British Permanent Under Secretary of State for
                                    Foreign Affairs.</note> who had hastened over to Paris for the
                                purpose. Sir Samuel Hoare arrived in the capital on Friday night or
                                Saturday morning, and after further negotiation the plan was
                                approved and communicated as is common knowledge, to the Italian
                                Government, the Negus and the League in the order named. In his
                                acceptance M. Laval is believed to have imposed three conditions;
                                (1) that Signor Mussolini should agree to the plan as offered within
                                twenty-four hours; (2) that, should negotiations begin, the Italian
                                Government should immediately halt the advance of its troops in
                                Ethiopian territory; (3) that the plan should be published
                                immediately upon its acceptance by the Duce. These proposals, which
                                have since been characterized as a flagrant violation of the
                                Covenant, were not, in the opinion of some, altogether undeserving.
                                It was later held that if the French Prime Minister had been able to
                                offer the proposals, as accepted by Italy, to the council as a
                                “peace” plan, the ensuing general feeling of relief would have
                                enabled the League to accept it. Pressure would have almost
                                certainly have been put upon the Negus either to fall in with the
                                scheme or to continue to fight at his own risk with the lukewarm
                                support of the League and with but little possibility of the further
                                application of sanctions in any form.</p>
                            <p>On December 9, just prior to the date fixed for full publicity, two
                                prominent organs of the French press, the <hi rend="italic">Echo de
                                    Paris</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Oeuvre</hi>, to the general
                                stupefaction, published the proposals in detail with but one
                                inaccuracy which concerned the longitudinal degree of the zone
                                accorded to the Italians as a settlement area. Copies of these
                                articles are enclosed.<note n="86" xml:id="d105fn86">Not
                                    reprinted.</note></p>
                            <p>From two sources, which the Embassy considers as reliable, it was
                                revealed how this “leak”, which was in a measure responsible for the
                                failure of the plan, occurred. It had been generally known that
                                since M. Laval assumed charge at the Quai d’Orsay, he had
                                consistently ignored the advice of his more important subordinates.
                                Such important officials as M. Alexis Léger, Secretary General, and
                                MM. Bargeton, Director, and Coulondre and Massigli, Assistant
                                Directors of Political and Commercial Affairs at the Quai d’Orsay,
                                had often been left completely in the dark as to the directives of
                                M. Laval’s foreign policy. It is alleged therefore that Mr. Léger,
                                who had been <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0167"/>present at the
                                final consultations, and was fully acquainted with the proposals,
                                “arranged” matters so that the representatives of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Echo de Paris</hi> (Pertinax) and the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Oeuvre</hi> (Madame Geneviève Tabouis) both
                                notoriously opposed to M. Laval and his foreign policy, should be
                                urgently advised to proceed to London without delay. On arrival they
                                were immediately and secretly informed from Paris by telephone with
                                regard to the details of the proposals and lost no time in
                                telephoning them back to their respective papers. Thus every effort
                                was made so that it should appear that the “leak” originated in
                                London and not in Paris. At the same time M. Poliakoff (Augur) was
                                informed in London and wired the details without comment to the <hi
                                    rend="italic">New York Times</hi>. The premature publication of
                                the plan, together with other factors which are now past history,
                                combined to render the proposals totally unacceptable. Public
                                opinion in England was aroused to a point which rendered imperative
                                the resignation of the Foreign Secretary and Signor Mussolini,
                                unwilling to appear to weaken his position, maintained more than a
                                discreet silence. M. Laval, according to reports, was then enjoying
                                a brief rest at his home at Chateldun and, when apprised of the turn
                                of events, made a fruitless last moment attempt to “explain” his
                                acquiescence but with little if any success.</p>
                            <p>The Embassy, while not able to vouch for the truth of the story
                                insofar as M. Léger’s role is concerned, does not consider it
                                improbable that the “leak” emanated from the Quai d’Orsay. As
                                previously stated, M. Laval’s seeming indifference to the advice of
                                his subordinates would indicate that a serious difference of opinion
                                had existed for some time between the more important Foreign Office
                                officials and himself. M. Laval, faced with the slogan “a premium on
                                aggression” found himself with his back to the wall and it was only
                                by a masterful justification of his Foreign Policy before the
                                Chamber that he was able to obtain two extremely slender votes of
                                confidence. The sincerity of his defense won him the day for his
                                most bitter enemies were forced to admit that his motive in
                                accepting the plan was to do all that was humanly possible at the
                                time to prevent the outbreak of hostilities in the
                                Mediterranean.</p>

                            <p>The Italian Ambassador<note n="87" xml:id="d106fn87">Augusto
                                    Rosso.</note> came in this afternoon to ask me whether I could
                                give him any side lights on European affairs as I had found them. I
                                said that that was rather a tall order because I had received <pb
                                    n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0168"/>such a deluge of
                                impressions of all kinds wherever I went. However, I would be glad
                                to tell him of some of them in which he might be more especially
                                interested. I said that during the weeks I had spent in England, I
                                had met a great many people of different sorts and opinions but I
                                had never heard one remark derogatory to the Italian people, nor had
                                I seen anything in the press which was in any way critical of the
                                Italian people. There was, of course, deep criticism of Mussolini
                                and of the course which he had pursued and was still pursuing. In
                                this respect there seemed to be a united opinion that Mussolini had
                                acted, to say the least, unwisely. Furthermore, there seemed to be
                                the impression in certain circles that Mussolini’s ambitions went
                                beyond Ethiopia and were in fact directly against the interests of
                                the British Empire as such. I admitted that, of course, I was no
                                judge as to whether this was a fact or not. I merely mentioned it as
                                a point of view which was freely expressed and discussed in British
                                circles.</p>
                            <p>In other circles there was considerably more alarm expressed at the
                                progress of German rearmament than in the Ethiopian affair. No one,
                                I said to him, could go to Germany and not be impressed as I have
                                been with the tremendous effort being made to rearm. The immense
                                growth in military establishments in and around Berlin and the new
                                academies for training this and that type of soldier were very
                                striking and when it was realized that a concentration of this
                                effort in and around Berlin was only one of several similar centers
                                of military output, even the dumbest person would grasp what was
                                happening.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador admitted that the Ethiopian affair had been badly
                                handled by the Italians in Geneva and elsewhere. It was regarded
                                throughout Italy as a purely colonial affair and not one in any way
                                involving the rest of the world. He felt that it was not unnatural
                                in the circumstances that there should be so much public feeling
                                against the British. The Ambassador mentioned during his call that a
                                certain Senator had recently cautioned him that he should discourage
                                efforts of Italians in this country from influencing Congress with
                                respect to pending neutrality legislation. Rosso in reply told the
                                Senator that he had nothing whatsoever to do with such activities;
                                that he was well aware that they did no good whatsoever for the
                                Italian cause, and actually did harm to that cause. It was true that
                                he did receive a great many copies of letters, the originals of
                                which were being sent to the State Department and to Members of
                                Congress, but his advice was not sought nor could he very well do
                                anything himself to control the activities which were being
                                complained of and which were largely the result of sentiment of
                                Italian-Americans for their home country. Most of these persons had
                                family connections in Italy and he supposed that their letters to
                                Congress were written as a result of their sentimental connection
                                with their country of origin. The Ambassador <pb n="104"
                                    xml:id="pg_104" facs="0169"/>wished me very clearly to
                                understand that the Embassy had nothing whatsoever to do with the
                                matter and that he wholeheartedly disapproved of the steps which had
                                been taken by the Italo-American people and which he fully realized
                                would not help in any way the Italian cause, rather the reverse.</p>

                                    Massigli, Director and Assistant Director, respectively, of
                                    Political and Commercial Affairs in the French Foreign Office,
                                    with whom the Chargé had had conversations on February 4.</note>
                                that little military progress was being made in Ethiopia and that
                                the present calm and inaction of the world powers was making it
                                difficult for Mussolini to keep up public resentment in Italy. The
                                present policy was to delay matters with respect to oil sanctions.
                                Massigli felt that the Technical Committee would presumably not have
                                its report ready for 10 days at least and thus there would be no
                                possibility of a meeting even to consider its approval before the
                                end of the month. After that considerable delays in application,
                                should it be decided on, might be envisaged and by that time the
                                rains would be coming along to put a stop to the active campaign in
                                Ethiopia. After that they felt that the costliness of the enterprise
                                in men and money would be becoming ever more clear to the Italian
                                people and the effect of the sanctions already existing more
                                difficult. It was Massigli’s opinion that the application of
                                sanctions had not borne heavily on French economy since the small
                                amounts that certain industries had lost in the regions contiguous
                                to the Italian frontier had been more than made up by share in
                                former Italian business gained in other industries.</p>

                            <p>46. In conversation with Mr. Suvich this afternoon he was very calm
                                and placid in his outlook upon the international situation. He said
                                    <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0170"/>that it had not changed
                                in any respect from his point of view, that there was no compromise
                                proposal in view and apparently no basis for any proposal. He said
                                he thought that while the situation had elements of danger, there
                                was nothing very alarming but that it would drift along in this way
                                for a while and that the countries’ representatives at Geneva would
                                eventually get tired of the sanction program and the great deal of
                                inconvenience that was being caused by it and that eventually there
                                would be a proposal made which would be more in conformity with the
                                facts and that there could be an eventual peaceful settlement which
                                would not involve Europe.</p>
                            <p>While he would not admit any immediate danger or any special element
                                of danger, nevertheless he confessed that the situation was bad. And
                                in spite of his denials, I thought I detected in his demeanor and
                                conversation a note of discouragement. It was not in anything he
                                said but in his rather subdued point of view and manner of
                                expression.</p>

                            <p>52. A member of the British delegation has informed me in confidence
                                respecting the subcommittee of experts now considering the question
                                of an embargo on petroleum.</p>
                            <p>The Committee will submit a purely objective technical report and
                                will make no decisions or recommendations. According to its terms of
                                reference it will base its report on the European hypotheses.</p>
                            <p>The hypotheses are, (1) if non-member states impose a complete or
                                partial (as for example restricted to normal exports) embargo, (2)
                                if non-League states place no embargo; both of which will be
                                considered in relation to the following factors, (3) the
                                effectiveness of an embargo applied by League states on
                                transportation, (4) the question of indirect supply, (5) the extent
                                to which Italy can employ substitutes, (6) the amount of Italian
                                petroleum stocks.</p>
                            <p>It is anticipated that the figures will show that if (2) obtains any
                                League embargo would not be effective. This would of course carry
                                the implication that non-sanctionist states (chiefly the United
                                States) would in such a case nullify any embargo measure.</p>
                            <p>Among the other states concerned he mentioned Egypt (which the
                                British assert they can control so that it is in effect a League
                                state) and Albania a non-sanctionist state whose supply is not
                                important.</p>
                            <p>In respect of (1) there remains the problem of the possible defection
                                    <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0171"/>of certain League
                                states. In this connection he stated that Venezuela is entirely
                                non-committal as to her policy and is attending the subcommittee
                                solely as an observer.</p>
                            <p>Respecting (3) he expects the Committee to find that Italian and
                                non-League tanker tonnage would be sufficient for Italy’s needs.</p>
                            <p>Respecting (4) the main concern is Germany.</p>
                            <p>Respecting (5) it is believed may be found to be an important
                                factor.</p>
                            <p>Respecting (6) information is incomplete but it is believed that the
                                supplies will be substantial.</p>
                            <p>The report will show conclusions which would intimate that the
                                shipments of petroleum by the United States would nullify a League
                                embargo. I do not doubt, however, that such inferences will be
                                expressed in the press as drawn from the figures of American
                                shipments embodied in the report. I feel that, however, such
                                conclusions will be offset to some degree by the data submitted
                                under point (5) and in a practical sense by point (6).</p>
                            <p>The Committee of Eighteen to which the report will be made will in my
                                informant’s opinion probably not meet until March. The whole
                                atmosphere of his conversation was that no petroleum embargo would
                                be actually applied. He mentioned that the procedure might be the
                                placing of a relatively distant date for an embargo which would then
                                be lifted when the date was reached as not offering a possibility of
                                being effective. Note in this connection Consulate’s despatch No.

                            <p>54. I learn the following in the strictest confidence from absolutely
                                reliable sources:</p>
                            <p>1. While the matter has not been touched upon in the petroleum
                                subcommittee, certain figures available here respecting the American
                                production and export of petroleum and possible conclusions drawn
                                therefrom have been privately discussed within a small group of
                                delegates chiefly, as far as I can determine, Italian [<hi
                                    rend="italic">Latin?</hi>] American delegates. The figures
                                indicate that the exports of the United States in relation to its
                                production and domestic consumption are substantially made possible
                                by imports from other states, chiefly Mexico and <pb n="107"
                                    xml:id="pg_107" facs="0172"/>Venezuela. They deduce from this,
                                and presumably from other elements in the situation, that the United
                                States by the action of other states could be eliminated as an
                                important factor in the embargo problem.</p>
                            <p>The Mexican representative here has stated that if the issue arose in
                                that form Mexico would be willing to regulate oil shipments to the
                                United States. The Venezuelan representative is greatly disturbed by
                                the possibilities presented, particularly if pressure were put on
                                Venezuela by the Netherlands through her Caribbean refining
                                arrangements, and is telegraphing his Government concerning this
                                entire question. He speaks at the same time of the difficulty of his
                                Government’s taking action in the matter of petroleum due to
                                revolutionary disturbances in her [<hi rend="italic">his</hi>]
                                country, a separatist movement in fact taking place in the oil area.
                                The Peruvian delegate is also concerned, although the relatively
                                small exports of Peruvian petroleum do not make the problem
                                important in a practical sense. The Argentine delegate is
                                preoccupied over the more general political implications in the
                                matter due to official notification that Buenos Aires has already
                                taken action on an embargo.</p>
                            <p>There is considerable speculation and anxiety on the part of all
                                Latin American delegates who are cognizant of this matter respecting
                                the possible position of the United States in its entire American
                                relationships and in a more general sense over possible
                                repercussions on American-European relationships as affecting the
                                League and also in their broader aspects. There are current vague
                                expressions of opinion of the bearing of the Monroe Doctrine in
                                certain contingencies.</p>
                            <p>I feel that I must say that I know nothing about the figures cited
                                nor whether the assumptions advanced have any validity. I must
                                emphasize, however, that the concern among the Latin American
                                delegates to whom this matter is known is obviously very real. Any
                                information for my own background with which the Department feels it
                                could furnish me would be appreciated.</p>
                            <p>2. Consulate’s 52, Feb. 6, 10 a.m. Contrary to all outward
                                impressions given that London is not anxious for the imposition of
                                an oil embargo against Italy, I learn that Eden in a recent
                                conversation with Cantilo, Argentine Ambassador at Rome, declared
                                that Great Britain was most desirous to have an embargo effected but
                                that she did not wish to take the lead. In the same conversation
                                Eden asserted that the bilateral and other European arrangements, in
                                which London was interested were all purely attempts to reinforce
                                the League and that there was no relaxation of London’s attachment
                                to the League and the general project of collective security. He
                                added, however, that the League Covenant would eventually have <pb
                                    n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0173"/>to be revised. He stated
                                that were Great Britain’s efforts in these respects not successful,
                                she must retire from the Continent and in a sense retire from the
                                League.</p>
                            <p>It is difficult to say whether Eden’s statements to Cantilo were
                                merely to reassure him respecting the League—the Latin American
                                states showing certain signs of defection in the matter of
                                sanctions—or whether especially in relation to the petroleum the
                                result of it represents London’s actual policy.</p>
                            <p>3. It is confidently asserted to me that under contracts concluded in
                                January, Rome has already paid for 800,000 tons of Rumanian
                                petroleum. The proportion of this already delivered in Italy is not
                                known. It is believed, however, that a substantial quantity is still
                                in Rumania. It is felt that in an application of an embargo, Rumania
                                might insist on an exemption on goods paid for.</p>

                            <p>58. Consulate’s 52, February 6, 10 a.m.</p>
                            <p>1. The data thus far studied by the Petroleum Subcommittee indicates
                                the following: total annual requirement of Italy at present rate of
                                consumption is from two to two and a half million tons; Italian
                                transport facilities will care for 75 per cent of this requirement;
                                substitutes are not an important factor, a perfected economical
                                product being a matter for the future; equivalent stocks in Italy
                                and Italian colonies total 500,000 tons which is regarded as limit
                                of present storage facilities including ships in ports.</p>
                            <p>Consulate’s 54, February 6, 8 p.m.</p>
                            <p>2. The relative size of stocks in Italy in proportion to purchases in
                                Rumania is regarded as indicating large quantities of “Italian oil”
                                at present in Rumania.</p>
                            <p>3. I am informed of the foregoing through Gomez, the Mexican Chairman
                                of the Subcommittee.</p>
                            <p>Respecting the position of the United States in this matter he felt
                                that the Latin-American delegates who were so concerned over the
                                question did not take into sufficient account the factor of stocks
                                in storage now in the United States.</p>
                            <p>4. The Mexican representative has been most active in advocating the
                                adoption and application of an oil embargo against Italy. He now
                                states that he was urged to this course by the British who also
                                suggested his chairmanship of the subcommittee. He says that the
                                British took the same line with other Latin-American states both
                                here <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0174"/>and through diplomatic
                                channels as suggested in paragraph 2 of my telegram No. 54. The
                                attitude now adopted here by the British that the figures indicate
                                that a petroleum embargo is not practicable is causing him extreme
                                annoyance declaring that he has been “let down”.</p>
                            <p>A number of Latin-American delegates have for some time been
                                intimating to me that the British were urging them that they should
                                support the League in the cause of peace their remarks carrying more
                                or less the implication that the United States was outside the peace
                                circle. The British were taking the opportunity, according to these
                                Latin Americans, to weaken the new relationship which we have built
                                up in Latin America. I naturally discount such views knowing the
                                great extent to which they are influenced by the tendency here for
                                Latin Americans to assume a role beyond their instructions and the
                                personal equations which enter the picture; the possibilities
                                discussed in paragraph 1 of my telegram last referred to
                                precipitated, however, the excited state of mind here which I
                                reported.</p>
                            <p>5. The press has for some days been drawing inferences deduced from
                                leaks in the studies of the Petroleum Subcommittee respecting the
                                positions of various states, both League and non-League as
                                nullifying any embargo measure. This has evoked repercussions in
                                various capitals and the Committee is now endeavoring to keep their
                                deliberations more secret and in particular is eliminating substance
                                from its communiqués.</p>
                            <p>6. As having something to do with the situation just described the
                                present program is that the report of the Subcommittee will be
                                transmitted privately to the governments for their consideration
                                before any further action is taken. This is viewed as confirming
                                that a meeting of the Committee of Eighteen will probably not take
                                place until March as reported in the final paragraph of my No.
                                52.</p>

                            <p>61. The following appear to me to be the chief elements of the report
                                of the Committee of Experts on oil embargo which was issued this
                                    morning.<note n="92" xml:id="d112fn92">For text, see League of

                                    Supplement No. 148, p. 64.</note></p>
                            <p>Consumption: estimated at 3,500,000 tons in 1935 including in the
                                last 5 months 20 to 30 thousand per month in the theatre of war.</p>
                            <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0175"/>
                            <p>Stocks: including supplies en route estimated at 3 to 3½ months
                                supply.</p>
                            <p>Supply: the report states that “in the event of such an embargo being
                                applied by all states members of the Coordination Committee it would
                                be effective if the United States of America was to limit its
                                exports [to Italy to the normal level of its exports] prior to 1935.
                                If such an embargo were applied by the states members of the
                                Coordination Committee alone, the only effect it would have on Italy
                                would be to render the purchase of petroleum more difficult and
                                expensive.” Attention is called to the fact that during the last few
                                months exports from the United States to Italy have shown a very
                                large increase. Special attention is also called to the position of
                                Venezuela. The report states that 80% of its production only reached
                                the consuming countries through the Netherlands West Indies but it
                                is pointed out that most of the remaining 20% is sent to the United
                                States and that there is no reason why this proportion could not be
                                increased and further that no technical reason exists why Venezuela
                                oil could not be sent to Italy for refining. I understand that a
                                reference in the original draft of the report to the fact that
                                Venezuela was not applying proposals 3 and 4 was eliminated on the
                                objection of the Venezuela representative.</p>
                            <p>Substitutes: the report states that in view of the possibility of
                                substitutes being used to some extent for petrol, an embargo on the
                                export of petroleum would be strengthened were it extended to cover
                                industrial alcohol and benzol.</p>
                            <p>Transport: “the effectiveness of an embargo imposed by states members
                                of the Coordination Committee on the transport of oil to Italy is
                                subject to the same limitations as an embargo on exports. Were these
                                states alone to prohibit the use of tankers for the transport of oil
                                to Italy, it would be able to satisfy its needs up to about 50% from
                                its own resources, and the rest by means of vessels of other states,
                                but with greater difficulty and at greater expense”. If an embargo
                                on transport should be decided on, Committee is of the opinion that
                                the most practicable form of embargo would be one which would
                                prohibit tankers, belonging member states, from proceeding to Italy
                                and would also prohibit the sale of tankers to states not applying
                                the embargo. Lacking detailed information, the Committee was unable
                                to estimate the extent of the difficulties which would be
                                encountered in applying this prohibition to vessels already on time
                                charter.</p>
                            <p>Special attention is drawn to the tanker tonnage of the United States
                                and Germany.</p>

                                    xml:id="d113fn93">F. C. Starling, head of the Petroleum
                                    Department, Board of Trade.</note> at the recent meetings of the
                                Experts Committees informs me as follows, requesting that the source
                                be kept confidential:</p>
                            <p>He believed that the earliest date for the convening of the Committee
                                of Eighteen is the end of the first week in March.</p>
                            <p>He stated that, as his delegation saw it, there were four courses
                                which the Committee of Eighteen might follow respecting the question
                                of petroleum: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) to decide that an embargo
                                could not be effective and thus bring the issue to an end; (<hi
                                    rend="italic">b</hi>) to set a date for the going into effect of
                                an embargo and to lift it as “impracticable” when that date was
                                reached; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) to impose an embargo and then
                                later lift it as not effective; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) based on
                                deductions from the report that a League embargo would be
                                “expensive” for Italy and thus, even if Italy obtained her supplies
                                elsewhere, would work against her prosecution of the war, to appoint
                                a subcommittee to study “how expensive” it would be. He stated that
                                the adoption of an embargo, its imposition to be contingent on
                                certain conditions, was now not a possible course as it had already
                                in effect been employed in adopting proposal 4–a.</p>
                            <p>My informant did not believe that (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) would be
                                adopted in view of the desire, both for political reasons as a
                                precedent and vis-à-vis public opinion, to conserve as far as
                                possible the aspect of maintaining the principles of the Covenant.
                                He felt that Russia and Rumania would not accept (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >c</hi>) as unduly injurious to their trade in relationship to
                                the limited achievement, thereby, of the end sought. He rather
                                thought that (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) would be the procedure
                                followed. It will be noted that the four alternatives are not
                                necessarily mutually exclusive, as for example, any one of the first
                                three could follow the last. The last he suggested might, however,
                                be employed as a convenient form for accomplishing the same end as
                                the first.</p>
                            <p>In any one of these alternatives taken in conjunction with the data
                                in the report and statements therein respecting the United States,
                                it will be seen that the Committee of Eighteen might formally
                                declare the position of the United States, in respect of shipments
                                to Italy, to be a determining factor. My informant seemed anxious to
                                assure me that every effort would be made to avoid placing the
                                “responsibility” on the United States.</p>
                            <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0177"/>
                            <p>2. The general atmosphere of these disclosures was that the foregoing
                                were by no means definite projects but merely indicated an
                                uncertainty as to the course which would be followed.</p>
                            <p>3. It may be observed from the character of the alternatives that
                                either through a recognition of political or of practical objections
                                there is no present intention to effect an embargo. The question may
                                thus arise as to why the procedures are continued when their
                                ostensible objective appears relatively impossible of achievement or
                                perhaps not desired by the controlling powers. This is nevertheless
                                a development with many precedents here. Certain reasons for this
                                are implied in the views of my informant which I have set forth
                                above. In general, as seen from here without definite information: a
                                desire to keep the situation fluid in order that later action may be
                                taken in either direction; awaiting some possible favorable material
                                development; the presentation of the aspect of maintaining the
                                principles of the League; to indicate, for its moral effect or
                                possibly as a form of pressure, the willingness of the League to
                                take action if not thwarted by conditions beyond its control.</p>

                            <p>73. Eden made a lengthy speech on foreign affairs this evening<note

                                extensively. The points in his speech which immediately struck me
                                were as follows:</p>
                            <p>(1) A vigorous reaffirmation for [<hi rend="italic">of</hi>] the
                                policy of collective action at Geneva in which England will play her
                                full part with other nations. (2) The desire that the League be
                                recognized as the agent of conciliation between Italy and Abyssinia
                                which in Eden’s interpretation should be along bases of Paris
                                proposals of last summer. (3) England is about to undertake a
                                program of extensive rearmament to enable her to play her part
                                effectively in the collective action of the League. England however
                                will take no part in a policy of encirclement. (This obviously had
                                reference to Germany.) (4) Eden stands by Hoare’s suggestion of last

                                stress on the necessity for seeking the cooperation of non-League

                            <p>67. Was with Suvich this afternoon when he received word from Geneva
                                that Eden had proposed oil embargo and as an alternative
                                    Flandin<note n="96" xml:id="d115fn96">Pierre Etienne Flandin,
                                    French Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Government of Albert
                                    Sarraut.</note> had proposed to call the Committee of Thirteen
                                and submit the whole question to them with the hope of finding a
                                solution of the Italo-Ethiopian difficulty. The Committee adopted
                                the Flandin suggestion. Suvich was apparently pleased and gratified
                                but not unduly hopeful. He told me that on February 27 Mussolini had
                                discussed very frankly the entire Italian situation with de
                                    Chambrim<note n="97" xml:id="d115fn97">Pineton de Chambrun,
                                    French Ambassador in Italy.</note> and had reminded him that it
                                was not Mussolini alone but various elements and sentiments in the
                                political control of Italy which had to be contended with and that
                                the situation had arrived at the point where Italy would withdraw
                                immediately from the League of Nations if additional sanctions were
                                imposed. He would do it reluctantly for he wanted to continue
                                political cooperation in Europe with England and France and to
                                maintain the Stresa front. However, he would have to reserve entire
                                freedom of action in Europe if any additional sanctions were
                                imposed. He did not mention Germany but the inference was that he
                                would seek help in other quarters.</p>
                            <p>In conversation this afternoon with the Czechoslovak Minister, he
                                told me that he had just heard from one of the highest Vatican
                                authorities that there was definitely a compromise peace proposal
                                being formulated. He associated it with de Chambrun’s conversation
                                with Mussolini and Flandin’s desire to arrange for a basis of
                                settlement of the conflict. From British Embassy sources it is
                                confirmed that de Chambrun’s conversation also concerned peace
                                proposals. In my conversation with Suvich he was unable to confirm
                                any details of a peace movement and would not admit the existence of
                                a well-defined peace effort. From all of these sources, however, I
                                am led to believe that some definite movement for the settlement of
                                the Italo-Ethiopian conflict is taking shape and may manifest itself
                                before the Committee of Thirteen. Mailed London, Paris, Geneva,
                                Berlin.</p>

                                concludes that exaggerated optimism is out of place. Italy is not

                                    <item>The Ecuadorean Government has presented a note to the
                                        Italian Government, a copy of which it is understood will be
                                        officially transmitted to Secretary General, to the effect
                                        that Ecuador’s position is that in view of Italy’s offer of
                                        conciliation (Consulate’s 81, March 9, 9 a.m.) sanctions
                                        against Italy should be immediately lifted. This is
                                        construed in Latin American circles here as meaning at the
                                        least that Ecuador in fact is canceling such sanction
                                        measures as she has adopted against Italy.</item>

                                        urging a reenforcement of sanctions against Italy. I am told
                                        that the implications lying back of this Mexican position
                                        are that if the League fails to pursue a policy of sanctions
                                        against an aggressor Mexico will consider her membership in
                                        the League without value and may take a public position to
                                        this effect.</item>

                                        future that the constitution or the procedures of the League
                                        must be shortly revised so as to exclude the participation
                                        of Latin American League members in non-American questions
                                        and of non-American League members in American questions and
                                        that failing such action Chile will consider withdrawing
                                        from active participation in the League.</item>

                                        these matters will I believe shortly come into the open I

                                        Department and that on their more general relationship to
                                        the League their position remains that of supporting the

                                        are enjoined by Buenos Aires strictly to avoid taking a

                                    <item>These developments are creating a violent stir among such
                                        Latin American representatives here as are aware of them and
                                        thus in my estimate of them I allow for probable
                                        exaggeration. I learn however that the more important of the
                                        delegations including Argentina have urgently requested
                                        instructions from their governments. The private
                                        conversations among the Latin Americans take particular note
                                        of the positions adopted by the Latin American Council
                                        powers at the recent Council sessions in London of which the
                                        Department is doubtless cognizant which have been felt here
                                        as probably foreshadowing an issue on some basis between the
                                        Latin American states and the League. I have reported what I

                                a definite intimation from Geneva that in view of the military
                                situation it was useless to insist on the letter and the spirit of
                                the League Covenant in negotiating with Italy. After a conversation
                                with the Emperor by telegraph the Council of Ministers decided this
                                morning to reply rejecting the suggestion and emphasizing
                                determination to negotiate only through the League. I gather this
                                decision was taken because military situation is not yet considered

                            <p>He adds that it appears unlikely that sanction can be extended
                                through auspices of League. It likewise appears that British have
                                not determined upon policy in event of failure of conciliation.</p>

                            <p>In a “preliminary” conversation between Madariaga and Aloisi,<note
                                    n="14" xml:id="d126fn14">Baron Pompeo Aloisi, Italian
                                    representative on the League Council.</note> the latter stated
                                bluntly any settlement must be on the basis of the Italian victories
                                and that Rome was no longer interested in the Hoare-Laval plan or
                                any other plan. It was intended to establish complete Italian
                                control in Ethiopia. Aloisi was extremely arrogant and told
                                Madariaga that “small power functionaries” had better keep out of
                                it.</p>
                            <p>Aloisi told Flandin that Italy would do nothing for France in Europe
                                unless Paris supported Rome in the Ethiopian affair. Flandin
                                asserted to Aloisi that there would be no sanctions against Italy as
                                long as he remained Minister and further that regardless of what
                                anyone else might do France will lift sanctions as soon as
                                hostilities cease. Aloisi then stated that Mussolini desired only a
                                delay of 15 days which is all that he estimates is necessary to
                                occupy Addis Ababa and he frankly described Italian strategy,
                                following such occupation, to be to set up their “own emperor”. He
                                stated that at that juncture their army would be proclaimed as the
                                “army of liberation.” Rome did not know what form British opposition
                                might take but if Great Britain wanted war Italy was ready.</p>
                            <p>A member of the British delegation, in discussing the situation with
                                me, stated that the delegation and the British Cabinet realized that
                                the “League battle” with Mussolini over Ethiopia is lost. They
                                estimate now that for Italy in effect to have all of Ethiopia is
                                just a question of time. He stated, however, that Eden had been
                                given instructions which, although allowing him greater flexibility
                                than in the Locarno affair, were to the effect that he was to keep
                                up the pressure in Geneva for sanctions of any type. He said that an
                                Italian victory would naturally be a blow to the League and a great
                                blow to British prestige in the Near and Far East. In answer to my
                                inquiry <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0185"/>as to why the
                                British would insist on bringing up the matter of sanctions through
                                the Committee of Eighteen in the face of the belief (which he
                                admitted) that the Committee would not adopt further sanctions, he
                                said frankly that the British would prefer a “League failure” to a
                                “British failure”. He added that in the dilemma this policy was in
                                line with the British-Tory view that the failure of the League would
                                at least permit British public opinion to support rearmament
                                (Consulate’s despatch No. 1537, Political, dated December 23,
                                    1935<note n="18" xml:id="d126fn18">Not printed.</note>). In
                                reply to a further inquiry as to what Great Britain would do with
                                their acquired “liberty of action” against Italy, he stated that
                                there remains the matter of credits which might prove to be a
                                formidable weapon.</p>

                            <p>201. In an informal conversation today a Foreign Office official
                                admitted that the Cabinet is now satisfied that economic sanctions
                                are ineffective towards terminating the conflict and he volunteered
                                the opinion that any further British proposals for such sanctions
                                would be made solely with a view to meeting British public opinion

                                that the Italian representative will be conciliatory, he understands
                                that Mussolini is very anxious for a settlement which will be
                                accepted by the Italian people as a “great victory” before the
                                beginning of the big rains in May or June. He understands that
                                Mussolini is increasingly apprehensive that Austria may be the next
                                Nazi objective and therefore wishes to be in a position for early
                                termination of the African campaign. He also understands that the
                                French are strongly urging in Rome this view of Nazi objectives in
                                Austria.</p>

                                tomorrow afternoon or Friday and that Flandin was not going.
                                Bargeton said that the French Government in the past few days had
                                been actively urging upon the Italian Government the necessity of
                                adopting a conciliatory attitude regarding peace negotiations with
                                Ethiopia in order that France might have something to take to the
                                British in an effort to keep the latter from pressing for the
                                tightening of sanctions with consequent further disruption of what
                                remains of European solidarity. He did not know what instructions
                                Aloisi was in fact bringing to Geneva but seemed to have some hopes
                                that a basis for negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia might be
                                reached. He remarked he was of the opinion that the British attitude
                                towards Italy was not primarily motivated by political reasons,
                                since the British Government realized that there are always ups and
                                downs in colonial ventures and that the future would lay many
                                obstacles in Italy’s path in Africa to keep her from threatening
                                British interests, but that there was a wave of “a sort of idealism”
                                in a British public opinion, a sympathy with the underdog aggravated
                                by the Italian use of poison gas and that this force of public
                                opinion was driving the British Government.</p>
                            <p>Regarding Germany, he said that the French Government did not know
                                the exact form in which the British inquiries would be put to the
                                German Government but he “supposed” these would be in your
                                possession soon. He said that the British Government had received
                                assurances “in principle” from the German Government regarding
                                non-fortification of the Rhineland during the proposed 4-month
                                period of negotiations, and, while the French Government was aware
                                that work was being done in the Rhineland on new air fields and gun
                                emplacements, he believed that Germany would not undertake
                                fortifications on a large scale during this period.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the recent Turkish request for revision of the status of
                                the Straits, Bargeton said that the French Government had not come
                                to any definite decision but was awaiting issues from the views of
                                powers more directly affected, such as Rumania and Bulgaria.</p>

                                on a member of the Committee of Thirteen today and disclosed to him
                                the Italian conditions for negotiations which they <pb n="122"
                                    xml:id="pg_122" facs="0187"/>had stated officially to Madariaga
                                and the Secretary General. He confirmed that Aloisi was not
                                empowered to negotiate but to discuss procedures. The Italian
                                conditions are as follows: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>The negotiations must be direct between the two parties
                                        and not through the intermediary of the League nor could any
                                        representative of the League be present. They must in all
                                        respects be bilateral. The two parties would however
                                        independently keep the League representatives informed of
                                        the proceedings. While the Italians asserted that this
                                        arrangement was “without the framework of the League” this
                                        is naturally a matter of construction.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>The conversations must be outside Geneva. The stated
                                        reason for this was to ensure the strictest secrecy which in
                                        Geneva the presence of journalists would render difficult.
                                        The Italian delegate admitted however that the purpose of
                                        this was to emphasize the nonparticipation of the League.
                                        The Italians suggested Ouchy.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>The question of an armistice could not be discussed at
                                        present.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>I take this last to mean that the Italians were thus making clear
                                that the negotiations could not be regarded as in progress until the
                                two first conditions outlined above had been agreed to. The Italians
                                stated however that (presumably the position they would take in the
                                negotiations) they were willing immediately to cease hostilities but
                                that due to the status of discipline and difficulties of
                                communication in the Ethiopian forces, Ethiopia must give
                                guarantees. These guarantees were forecast as (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >a</hi>) definitely an Italian control of the railway to Addis
                                Ababa, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) probably the Italian occupation of
                                Addis Ababa.</p>

                            <p>121. 1. The following is a résumé given me by an entirely responsible
                                source of the developments in a strictly secret meeting today of the
                                Committee of Thirteen.</p>
                            <p>Madariaga reported that the position of the Italians on the
                                procedural question of the negotiations was to the effect that they
                                be strictly bilateral, the details being as described in paragraphs
                                1 and 2 of my 120, April 16, 4 p.m., except that the League would be
                                informed of the procedures as an “act of courtesy” by means of joint
                                communiqués and not independently by the two plenipotentiaries.
                                Respecting an armistice, the Ethiopian Government must apply direct
                                to Marshal Badoglio and the League must give assurances that during
                                such an armistice Ethiopia would refrain from hostilities.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the ensuing discussion the same divergence as in previous
                                    <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0188"/>meetings continued
                                between the British and the French. The entire atmosphere was that
                                the committee members were reconciled to material events deterring
                                the issue.</p>
                            <p>Boncour proposed that Madariaga get in touch with the Ethiopian
                                delegation and exercise pressure upon it to veto its present terms
                                that the negotiations take place through the intermediary of the
                                League.</p>
                            <p>France was strongly supported by Poland and Ecuador and particularly
                                by Rumania, the Rumanian representative stating that the Committee
                                should “consider facts” and permit peace to be established.</p>
                            <p>Eden protested against this view declaring that pressure should not
                                be placed on a victim of aggression.</p>
                            <p>Madariaga requested that his mandate be clarified whether it was
                                desired that the negotiations take place within the framework of the
                                League or whether he was granted freedom of action to discuss peace
                                on any terms.</p>
                            <p>It was decided that Madariaga should discuss with the Ethiopian
                                delegation the question of Ethiopia modifying its conditions
                                respecting negotiations procedure but without employing pressure and
                                report the results to a meeting of the Committee tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>2. A member of the Italian delegation informs me that should Ethiopia
                                accept the Italian terms for the negotiation procedures, they would
                                state to the Ethiopian plenipotentiary the conditions for a
                                cessation of hostilities in which Ethiopia must acquiesce before
                                negotiations of a general settlement could begin. He added that not
                                until such a time would these conditions be made known. I have good
                                reason to believe however, that the conditions which the Italians
                                have in view are substantially those described in the latter part of
                                my telegram No. 120.</p>
                            <p>3. Despatches received by representatives here from their diplomatic
                                missions in London express the view that the British are employing
                                the poison gas issue to the greatest extent possible to assist in
                                maintaining support for the Government in its present position
                                against Rome on the part of British public opinion and also more
                                generally to rouse world opinion against Italy.</p>
                            <p>A member of the British delegation informs me that the Government is
                                receiving more letters in support of its position than at any time
                                since the beginning of the hostilities in Africa. He inquired of me
                                as to the reaction in the United States to the Italian use of poison
                                gas.</p>
                            <p>4. Diplomatic opinion here inclines to the view that any financial or
                                economic weakening of Italy is not a factor sufficient to affect the
                                situation in its present phase. Expression of opinion here has now
                                become almost entirely open in Assembly, the issue as being
                                primarily <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0189"/>between Great
                                Britain and Italy. In this respect, the only measure short of war,
                                which it is seen the British could employ to prevent a probable
                                Italian control of Ethiopia, would lie in some turn in the European
                                situation which would suggest to Rome the necessity of bargaining
                                between her African and European positions.</p>

                            <p>124. 1. Having now had opportunity to learn precisely what took place
                                in the meeting of the Committee of Thirteen described in my 121,
                                April 16, midnight, paragraph 1, I supplement my report on certain
                                points as follows:</p>
                            <p>Aloisi made a formal statement to Madariaga and Avenol to the effect
                                that if the League and Ethiopia accept the Italian conditions Italy
                                is prepared to participate actively in the present general situation
                                in Europe.</p>
                            <p>Madariaga told the Committee that the Ethiopians had been informed of
                                the Italian conditions and that they definitely refused the plan for
                                direct negotiations and also that the negotiations take place
                                outside of Geneva and had requested the Committee to conclude that
                                the Italian Government has not agreed to negotiate within the
                                framework of the League.</p>
                            <p>The Polish delegate stated that he was instructed by his Government
                                to inform the Committee that his Government considers that the
                                responsibility in the first place must be taken by the powers
                                chiefly interested through geographic or other considerations;
                                before the other powers can pronounce anything the interested powers
                                must state their positions. (This was regarded as in effect a
                                significant disavowal of League responsibility.)</p>
                            <p>Eden, although opposing any pressure upon the Ethiopians, stated that
                                Madariaga and Avenol could tell them that if they accepted the
                                Italian conditions the Committee would not make any objections. He
                                then said that if the Committee were unsuccessful in bringing the
                                two parties together, it must register the failure of conciliation
                                and refer the matter to the Council or to the Committee of Eighteen.
                                That organ could decide either that the League has done all that it
                                could in this affair and so state to the world or take new
                                action.</p>
                            <p>2. I learn respecting Eden’s reference to the matter being referred
                                to the Council that it is the present British policy to accomplish
                                this <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0190"/>if possible. In the
                                Council the two parties will be present and would thus, in a sense,
                                be compelled to express their position, although perhaps Italy could
                                in fact evade this. Likewise to a degree, the positions of the other
                                Council powers would be brought more into the open, the British aim
                                being to present the true picture to world opinion for its possible
                                effect on the policy of Council states, and, at the same time, to
                                demonstrate to British public opinion that Great Britain had done
                                its utmost through the League.</p>
                            <p>3. I learn that the opinion is common among the Council members that
                                the British are in close association with the Ethiopian delegation
                                on the latter’s position here and perhaps also in Addis Ababa. Thus
                                the positions the British may take are seen as having a relationship
                                to this circumstance.</p>

                            <p>125. 1. I am informed that in a secret meeting of the Committee of
                                Thirteen today, the following were the chief developments:</p>
                            <p>Madariaga reported that the Ethiopian delegation had categorically
                                rejected the Italian terms for negotiation and had added that
                                Abyssinian opinion had perceived that the matter had developed into
                                two questions, one between Italy and Ethiopia and one between Italy
                                and the League, and the Ethiopian had been abandoned.</p>
                            <p>Eden made a statement to the effect that as it was evident that
                                conciliation had failed the only recourse for the Committee was to
                                refer the matter to the Council from which it had received its
                                mandate.</p>
                            <p>It was decided that the Committee would meet tomorrow to adopt a
                                report to the Council. The date set for the Council is Monday, April
                                20.</p>
                            <p>Vasconcellos said that it appeared desirable that the Committee of
                                Eighteen should be convened for next week but that no day would be
                                set until after the Council meeting.</p>
                            <p>2. It appears to be understood that the Council meeting will be
                                public. The atmosphere in Geneva is sober but not tense. Speculation
                                turns on the extent to which positions taken in private in the
                                recent series of Committee meetings would be maintained in public.
                                It would appear evident that a maintenance of such positions would
                                create a situation subversive to the League’s position.</p>

                            <p>132. While much remains to become clear respecting the exact
                                character and significance of the reported recent <hi rend="italic"
                                    >rapprochement</hi> between the British and the French the
                                following is roughly the immediate picture presented here.</p>
                            <p>An important motive for this understanding is seen in the alarm felt
                                over the recently increasing antagonism between the public opinion
                                in the two countries which has been tying the hands of both
                                Governments. It is thus expected unless some unforeseen change
                                occurs that the details of the procedures here while involving
                                compromises and presumably avoiding the aspect of abrupt changes in
                                policy will work to the end of appeasing this antagonism.</p>
                            <p>The question of a necessary concession to the French Government in
                                view of the forthcoming elections has been prominently put forward,
                                the British delegation has inspired the inference that after the
                                elections the French will act with the British against Italy. In
                                conversations with members of both the British and French
                                delegations, however, they tell me frankly that no one anticipates
                                that the results of the elections can affect French policy to any
                                material degree in respect of the Italian-Ethiopian matter per se
                                and that Eden despite anything he may state which is reflected by
                                the British press fully recognizes this.</p>
                            <p>In diplomatic circles the deduction is that the British in view of
                                continental considerations have changed definitely at least the
                                character of their tactics in the Italo-Ethiopian question.</p>
                            <p>As I have previously reported the arrangement appears to include the
                                understanding that while there will be no increase of sanctions the
                                present measures against Italy will be maintained. The question has
                                already arisen nevertheless respecting the continued efficacy of the
                                present measures. The representatives of several small states tell
                                me that in the face of the existing situation they believe that
                                their Governments will soon be obliged in some way to allow private
                                interests to resume trade with Italy. The Czechoslovak
                                representative has particularly emphasized this. I learn that the
                                Ecuadoran representative presented Vasconcellos with a communication
                                notifying Ecuador’s lifting of sanctions but that the latter
                                persuaded him to withhold it until after today’s Council
                                meeting.</p>
                            <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0192"/>
                            <p>The relationship of the Franco-British entente outside of the
                                immediate League situation—that is to the German and general
                                European situation—from what I can gather from talks with members of
                                the two delegations seems to be as yet largely speculative, despite
                                the extent to which the heads of the delegations for political
                                reasons may express themselves on this score.</p>
                            <p>The most informed opinion seems to be that although there have been
                                exchanges of views no commitments in substance have been made here
                                in this respect. The immediate aim has been sought of at least
                                facilitating Franco-British understanding in other fields which is
                                seen as a gain for Great Britain as well as for France. The
                                employment of this understanding cannot, it is felt, be forecast
                                until its effect on Germany can be measured and until Italy’s return
                                to the European picture. It is believed that until then nothing can
                                be predicted respecting in particular its permanence. Back of it all
                                moreover lies the question as to how London apparently turning from
                                action through the League will meet the Italian threat to British
                                interests which Ethiopia may now imply.</p>

                                dominated by two efforts: (1) to bring about peace between Italy and

                                already inflamed feeling between the British and French public. The
                                first effort failed, the second was successful, and tempers are much
                                abated both in delegations and press. This does not mean that the
                                fundamental divergencies of their points of view are eradicated, but
                                merely that they are less apparent due to conciliatory attitude on
                                both sides in not pressing for their maxima in respect to the
                                Italo-Abyssinian question. It is more than possible that the
                                divergencies will again become acutely apparent after the French
                                elections. Indeed, Madariaga believes that one of the first steps of
                                the new French Government will be to initiate futher peace efforts
                                under the instigation of the Italians.</p>
                            <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0193"/>
                            <p>2. While I am assured both by the British and French that the French
                                made no effort to lift existing sanctions, nevertheless, it is
                                apparent that the current has changed. Where previously the general
                                desire was to increase severity of sanctions under British lead and
                                against French restraint, now the ebb has set in and the British
                                realize that they must maneuver carefully if existing sanctions are
                                not to be swept away. The British tell me that they were urged by
                                those hitherto most convinced of the necessity of sanctions not to
                                risk calling the Committee of Eighteen lest the whole thing break
                                down.</p>
                            <p>3. Several factors induced the British to modify their attitude to
                                meet the French: A. Tardy recognition of the importance of the
                                Italian military effort and Italian successes in Abyssinia; B. The
                                demands of Paul-Boncour not to be pressed to make an unpopular
                                decision on the eve of elections; C. Apprehension as to the
                                instability of European conditions particularly in respect to
                                Germany’s intentions; D. The French plea that the Italian alignment
                                with France is urgently necessary in the immediate European
                                situation. They feel so strongly this necessity that if its
                                achievement results in disaster for the League, so much the worse
                                for the League.</p>
                            <p>Both Eden and Madariaga paid tribute to the conciliatory efforts of
                                Paul-Boncour.</p>
                            <p>4. The British realize that they are gambling on a time factor. If
                                before the rains in Abyssinia set in towards the end of May
                                Abyssinia’s resistance is fully crushed, it will mean a disastrous
                                defeat to British policy. The moment then comes for the realization
                                by the British public that nothing but force will stop Mussolini
                                from full achievement of his objective. I quote responsible
                                authority which states that however much the Labor and Liberal
                                parties assailed the use of force arising in the application of
                                sanctions, the Government of Great Britain refuses to entertain this
                                idea. On the other hand, if Abyssinia’s resistance still continues
                                after the period of rains, thus permitting the full effects of the
                                sanctions to be felt by Italy, the British hope, Mussolini may be
                                more ready to negotiate reasonably.</p>
                            <p>5. Aloisi talks with all the bitterness of the Italian press. He says
                                they want peace but they will not negotiate it through the Committee
                                of Thirteen or through the League since this organization has become
                                a “creature of England.” Italy will not submit that every step of
                                negotiation be scrutinized by hostile eyes to see whether it is in
                                the “spirit of the Covenant.” He claims that the military resistance
                                has been crushed but the Abyssinians, and to some extent the
                                British, take a contrary view.</p>
                            <p>6. A manifest was drafted before the public session of the Council.
                                At the close of that session I encountered Eden who, obviously
                                deeply <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0194"/>moved and referring
                                to the collective effort against Italy, said to me “It is slipping
                                badly. We have done our best but I fear it is going to crumble.”</p>

                                for Eden’s admission of the League’s failure and the desirability of

                                appeal for the removal of sanctions which was well received by
                                Conservative members. I understand that sentiment in the Cabinet is
                                moving rapidly in the same direction.</p>
                            <p>However, the debate has precipitated partisan divergencies which are
                                reflected in today’s press. The Labor <hi rend="italic">Daily
                                    Herald</hi> states “the Government’s loss of a seat at Peckham
                                expresses above all else a loss of popular confidence in its foreign
                                policy and in Mr. Eden. Those who once placed hope in him will read
                                his speech of yesterday with despair.” The opposition Liberal <hi
                                    rend="italic">Manchester Guardian</hi> states “all this inquest
                                on the dead past matters less than the lively present and the future
                                which either actively or passively, the Government is shaping for
                                us. What then had Mr. Eden to say about this? Nothing at all.” Both
                                the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Daily
                                    Telegraph</hi> criticise the opposition for taking a partisan
                                line on a question of foreign policy and emphasized that the
                                League’s failure was not individual but collective. The independent
                                Conservative <hi rend="italic">Daily Mail</hi> proclaims “That the
                                right course for Great Britain is to clean the slate and give notice
                                as soon as possible that she will have nothing more to do with
                                sanctions or with the penal clauses of the Covenant.”</p>
                            <p>This debate marks the beginning of the anticipated period of
                                readjustment for the British public as well as for the
                                Government.</p>

                            <p>That Italy’s annexation of Abyssinia has caused much dissatisfaction
                                in official circles here is attested in a Havas communiqué informing
                                the public that the French Government had given advance warning to
                                the Italian Government that it made all reservations with respect of
                                such procedure.</p>
                            <p>The French Government had been exerting all its powers of persuasion
                                to avert such an open challenge to the League and particularly to
                                England and France the principal interested powers. In fact it went
                                so far as to sound a warning in Rome that annexation would make it
                                difficult for the French representative in Geneva to resist the
                                application of sanctions.</p>
                            <p>While the Duce’s decision was expected and therefore not surprising
                                it has caused considerable reaction in public opinion which runs the

                                Stresa front and disgust at the Duce’s brutal manner of concluding
                                his conquest with total disregard for League face.</p>
                            <p>Press reaction to Italy’s annexation of Abyssinia is markedly divided
                                between the Right and Left. While the former expresses a certain
                                reluctant resignation to facts and urges a moderate attitude toward
                                those facts, the latter clamors for revenge on Italy and the
                                prevention of the exploitation of her conquest by the preservation
                                and strict continued application of League principles.</p>
                            <p>The consensus of Right opinion is that an almost irremediable blow
                                has been deliberately dealt the League from which it will be
                                difficult to recover and that the Geneva body will now be painfully
                                obliged to adjust facts to principles without destroying those
                                principles and without denying those facts.</p>

                            <p>168. (1) In a public meeting of the Council this afternoon which
                                dealt solely with the Italo-Ethiopian dispute and at which Italy was
                                not represented Eden presented “as a result of an exchange of views
                                between various members of the Council” a resolution stating in
                                effect: that further time “to consider the situation created by the
                                grave new steps taken by the Italian Government” was necessary, that
                                the Council would take up the matter again June 15 and that in the
                                meantime it considered there was “no cause for modifying the
                                measures previously adopted in collaboration by the members of the
                                League”.</p>
                            <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0197"/>
                            <p>The Ethiopian delegate made another plea for the integral application
                                of article 16.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine delegate said: “In view of the present serious
                                circumstances, and for the safeguarding of the fundamental
                                principles of our Covenant, I accept the draft resolution submitted,
                                nevertheless making a reservation on behalf of my Government as far
                                as the adjournment of the discussion is concerned.”</p>
                            <p>The representative of Chile said that he had no objection to an
                                adjournment of the question but desired to state “without
                                pre-judging the examination of the substance of the problem that my
                                Government is of the opinion that, since the war is finished, we
                                should proceed to raise sanctions”. Sanctions, he said, no longer
                                have any object and the adoption of Chile’s point of view would
                                constitute an effective contribution toward remedying the present
                                economic and political crisis. Since, under the resolution proposed,
                                sanctions would remain in being, he would refrain from voting.</p>
                            <p>The representative of Ecuador stated that he approved the adjournment
                                of the question but could not agree to continuance of sanctions. His
                                Government on the contrary considered that as soon as Italy had
                                declared herself prepared to enter into negotiations the situation
                                would have been simplified by raising sanctions. With all the more
                                reason his Government could not now associate itself with their
                                maintenance. He would, therefore, vote for the adjournment subject
                                to the reservation he had made in regard to sanctions.</p>
                            <p>The President then declared the resolution<note n="33"

                                enough of Geneva particularly after its attempt to perpetuate the
                                fiction of an Ethiopia that fortunately will never again exist and
                                it signifies that Italy will remain aloof from the League so long as
                                its present attitude continues. This is the first step in definite
                                clearing up of Italy’s European and League positions. Sanctions now
                                can be nothing but an indication of unfriendliness or hostility on
                                the part of individual governments and Italy will cooperate neither
                                with the League so long as sanctions continue nor with any
                                government applying them. Meanwhile she cooperates actively with
                                Austria, Hungary, Albania and other important European countries and
                                pursues a policy of collaboration with the United States who has
                                kept aloof from League imbroglios, with many South American

                            <p>403. In conversation with an official at the Foreign Office yesterday
                                afternoon he said that the exact status of Ethiopia was “most
                                confusing and without precedent”. He said that the French Government
                                had received official notification from the Italian Government of
                                the decree annexing Ethiopia; the French Government, however, had
                                not as yet “even begun to consider” what form any reply if and when
                                made might take. There were “no useful precedents” for such a case,
                                for instance during the World War Belgium had been overrun and
                                occupied but the Belgian Government always remained in possession of
                                the Belgian soil and in active resistance to the enemy; the more
                                recent case of Manchuria “was much less delicate” for France since
                                French interests there were relatively unimportant. The League of
                                Nations in its resolution of May 12, 1936,<note n="38"
                                    xml:id="d141fn38">League of Nations, <hi rend="italic">Official
                                        Journal</hi>, June 1936, p. 540.</note> had “apparently”
                                decided that Ethiopia still existed as an independent state “and
                                there the matter stands”. He said that the French Government had
                                counselled the Italian Government against any such drastic move as
                                annexation pure and simple and had made “reservations” against such
                                an eventuality well in advance of the Italian announcement of
                                annexation.</p>
                            <p>In response to an inquiry he said that there had been no “active” <pb
                                    n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0200"/>discussions with the
                                Italian Government respecting French interests in Ethiopia such as
                                the railway; the impression was obtained however that the
                                “reservations” undoubtedly covered such interests.</p>
                            <p>This official said that the French Government was completely in the
                                dark regarding the exact significance to be attached to the
                                withdrawal of the Italian delegation from Geneva and that the
                                Italian Ambassador whom he had seen the night before could throw no
                                light on the matter. He (this official) believed however that
                                Mussolini had no present intention-of withdrawing from the League
                                since the League might prove useful later on to Italy and that the
                                dramatic departure of Aloisi had been ordered more in the nature of
                                a protest against the attitude assumed by the Council in the
                                Ethiopian question.</p>
                            <p>He said that in the meeting at Geneva of the Locarno powers (minus
                                Italy) there had been no discussion beyond an agreement that nothing
                                could be discussed until Germany replies to the British
                                    questionnaire.<note n="39" xml:id="d141fn39">See telegram No.

                            <p>He added that while there seemed to be a certain amount of attention
                                being given to schemes for the reform of the League (for instance
                                the British press has been publishing letters) such a matter would
                                obviously require months of work and the French Government was at
                                present more concerned with finding some practical solutions to the
                                pressing problems immediately confronting Europe.</p>

                            <p>177. The aftermath of the Council meetings has presented to my mind a
                                picture of definite significance.</p>
                            <p>The turn of events has obviously brought European League states very
                                close to a crossroads where decisions must perforce be taken. There
                                is reflected here an actual conflict in progress in all European
                                capitals between two courses of action, i. e., whether to make a
                                final effort to salvage if possible collective security or to seek
                                to achieve their national necessities by other means. In the
                                “neutral” states this latter takes the form of a possible return to
                                their historical position of neutrality; among the other states it
                                is seen in their seeking new alliances or regional arrangements.
                                Which tendency may prevail is still an open question, but this
                                preponderating evidence of the moment suggests a turning to
                                nationalistic policies, a trend which is given an impetus by the
                                feeling in a number of states that they cannot afford long to
                                postpone the tactical advantages of early action.</p>
                            <p>The policy of the maintenance of existing sanctions is not accorded
                                real support in any quarter. It is described here as being “no
                                policy” in that it not only does not accomplish the end sought but
                                also has the disadvantages of prolonging the disruptions in finance
                                and trade and of being in a political sense an aggravation rather
                                than a cure. In my view, however, this policy does serve the
                                immediate end of holding the European states temporarily together on
                                the semblance of a common basis.</p>
                            <p>The unanimous view of the government representatives here is that
                                there are only two possible courses which can in honesty be called
                                policies, (1) to impose effective economic sanctions which would

                                elements.</p>
                            <p>Eden remained in Geneva with the intent of ascertaining further the
                                views of the European states and in order to formulate his report to
                                the Cabinet and to prepare to face Parliament. There was no attempt
                                at coordinating a policy between the League states inasmuch as he
                                had no British policy to present.</p>

                            <p>The neutral powers merely recapitulated their attitudes as outlined
                                in my 158, May 11, 5 p.m.<note n="43" xml:id="d143fn43">Not

                            <p>The Little Entente displayed a marked division of views among its
                                members indicating trends toward new arrangements. The Balkan
                                Entente showed a somewhat greater solidarity in expressing common
                                fears of Italian designs on their territory. The Jugoslav Foreign
                                Minister stated bluntly to Eden “you will eventually have to fight
                                Italy for the Mediterranean and the Suez. I suggest the wisdom of
                                your doing so now while you have us with you and not later when we
                                might very possibly be in some other camp.” There is a recrudescence
                                of talk, although vague, concerning a Mediterranean pact and the
                                possible inclusion of Italy therein.</p>
                            <p>Litvinoff said to Eden, “should you have proposed in yesterday’s
                                Council military action against Italy I would have pledged material
                                support”. As the matter stands, Russia is seen as playing an
                                opportunist policy. Litvinoff was responsible for the insertion of
                                the weakening phrase “in the meantime” in the Council’s resolution

                            <p>Poland, while naturally in no way associated with them, adopts here
                                the general position of the neutral powers and assumes a questioning
                                attitude.</p>
                            <p>The extreme uncertainty of the French position is seen in that
                                Paul-Boncour absented himself from the drafting of the Council

                            <p>What Great Britain will do in the present circumstances is regarded
                                here as incalculable. There is talk that London may be able to
                                exercise a determining financial pressure on Italy. There is also a
                                revival of the belief that Great Britain will attempt to check
                                Mussolini by encouraging Berlin to precipitate the <hi rend="italic"

                            <p>180. Consulate’s 177, May 15, 8 p.m., paragraph 8. I have just
                                learned in confidence the length to which the question of a
                                Mediterranean pact has actually proceeded. In the conversations
                                described in my telegram under reference the following privately
                                transpired.</p>
                            <p>The Balkan Entente representatives broached to Eden and to the French
                                representative who remained here, the question of a Mediterranean
                                pact to include Great Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Yugoslavia,
                                Greece and Turkey, which the last three named jointly and
                                individually advocated.</p>
                            <p>While Madariaga<note n="47" xml:id="d144fn47">Salvador de Madariaga,
                                    Spanish permanent delegate to the League of Nations.</note>
                                discussed such a development with certain interested representatives
                                under the guise of seeing a settlement of the League situation, in
                                some instances he disclosed the favorable attitude of the Spanish
                                Government to the project and it must be assumed that he was acting
                                under instructions.</p>
                            <p>The attitude of Eden toward the Balkan representatives and toward
                                Madariaga was most carefully assumed. He took care especially to
                                impress upon his own auditors that he himself had not raised the
                                question in any way, although his spoken statements were merely that
                                the idea was not excluded, the impression gained by them was that
                                his attitude was distinctly favorable and in fact that he seemed to
                                be relieved that such a scheme was in the making. It is known that
                                he immediately communicated with London on the subject.</p>
                            <p>Madariaga presented the question to the Italian representative here
                                who made no comment except that he would transmit the matter to
                                Mussolini direct.</p>
                            <p>France is known to be favorable.</p>
                            <p>The whole plan is being most cautiously advanced partly through the
                                agency of Madariaga, not in the form of a proposal but as a private
                                raising of the matter in respect of the problem with which the
                                League is faced.</p>
                            <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0204"/>
                            <p>As a part of the picture here, Madariaga rather freely discusses a
                                plan for League reorganization in which it will be noted such a pact
                                would fit. This plan is in brief a reaffirmation of the Covenant by
                                all League states accompanied by such reservations as each might
                                wish to make concerning, for example, articles such as 16 and the
                                setting up of regional arrangements which would embody any article
                                or groups of articles of the Covenant. The foregoing is in fact a
                                serious project for the reestablishment of the League, but my
                                informants also regarded it as being susceptible of preparing public
                                opinion at the same time for a Mediterranean pact.</p>
                            <p>The proposed pact is in reality perceived as a means of presenting a
                                counter to Germany as well as to Italy in the entire European field.
                                Russia is known to be advocating its consummation for this reason.
                                    Beneš,<note n="48" xml:id="d144fn48">Eduard Beneš, President of

                                entirely favorable and Madariaga will shortly visit Praha to confer
                                with him concerning its development. Rumania is officially aloof but
                                it is known that Bucharest will be favorable provided it shows signs
                                of being realized, the advantages to her lying through her
                                interlocking arrangements with the Little Entente and Balkan
                                Entente. The preoccupation of the Balkan Entente states in respect
                                of this question is primarily their fear of Italy. Their attitude is
                                therefore that such an arrangement is of no value to them whatsoever
                                unless it embodies mutual assistance guarantees by Great Britain and
                                France.</p>
                            <p>Thus the whole question is seen to hinge at this time on the British
                                position.</p>
                            <p>My informants, who participated in the discussion concerned, tell me
                                that they regard this whole endeavor as of genuine significance.</p>
                            <p>A general difficulty is found in how the Italian position respecting
                                “recognition” of Abyssinia can be surmounted.</p>

                            <p>176. In spite of the optimism to official statements of Italy’s
                                present financial and economic situation the damage that is being
                                done to Italian economy by the operation of sanctions is being
                                frankly admitted. For a country like Italy which has reached an
                                important <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0205"/>stage of
                                industrialization a reduction of foreign trade in the aggregate by
                                43% such as has occurred as a result of sanctions cannot be looked
                                upon with equanimity by those responsible for the welfare of the
                                country. The possibility that the temporary loss by Italy of markets
                                abroad might become permanent with the passage of time is also a
                                major preoccupation. It is natural, therefore, that from the
                                economic and financial point of view the Italian Government should
                                be eager to have sanctions terminated as soon as possible, either
                                through the crumbling of the sanctionist front or through concerted
                                action at Geneva. There is reason to believe that Italy would prefer
                                the former method of getting rid of sanctions since the possibility
                                of her being asked by the League to [apparent omission] humiliation
                                would not then arise as it might if she were faced by a solid front
                                in Geneva ready to lift sanctions but in return for a <hi

                            <p>Furthermore, it is not only because of financial and economic
                                considerations that Italy desires the elimination of sanctions but
                                for moral reasons as well. And the last might conceivably be the
                                most impelling of the three. Mussolini, in spite of public
                                declarations to the contrary, undoubtedly feels keenly the stigma
                                attached to Italy’s position of a virtual outlaw in Europe and the
                                disability under which he now labors in taking an active role in
                                European affairs. Not only is this feeling shared by the people
                                themselves but they are certain to interpret the continuation of
                                sanctions after the original avowed objective thereof has failed as
                                a manifestation of malice and vengeance directed against them. It is
                                believed here at the present time that Italy might still hold out
                                against sanctions for another 6 months or even a year before the
                                economic financial situation became acute enough to cause Mussolini
                                to weaken in his resolution to carry through to the end the
                                political policies he has resolved upon. In the meantime, however,
                                there would be a very real danger that the moral factors mentioned
                                above might cause the people under Mussolini’s direction to react
                                much more violently than they did at the time when sanctions were
                                applied and that the outcome of this reaction might develop into a
                                further element of complication in the already confused European
                                scene. Even in circles where wholehearted disapproval of Italy’s
                                action as regards Ethiopia is manifested this danger is recognized
                                and taking the long view the opinion prevails in these circles at
                                the present time that everything should be done to avoid
                                exasperating Mussolini and the Italians to the point where they
                                might break forth in further excesses as a protest against what is
                                now regarded as an insult to their national pride and an injury to
                                their economic life.</p>

                            <p>197. I have from time to time been able to confirm from further
                                sources the substance of my telegram 180, May 16, 6 p.m., concerning
                                a projected Mediterranean pact and to obtain the following
                                information respecting recent developments.</p>
                            <p>(1) The Balkan Entente states appear to be anxiously hopeful that one
                                of the great powers take the initiative. The approaches of Belgrade,

                                which are manifestly eager, due to their fear of Italy, that such
                                project be consummated.</p>
                            <p>As indicative of this I find that the Ministers here of the three
                                states first named are being kept unusually informed by their
                                Governments as to how the matter is progressing.</p>
                            <p>(2) In a conversation with an informed Italian official here he
                                confirmed to me the transmission of the Mediterranean “proposals” to
                                Rome in the manner I previously described. He stated frankly and I
                                believe sincerely that while Rome had presumably not advised him on
                                all points he had nevertheless officially been instructed “for his
                                guidance” on the background of pertinent Italian policy. He told me
                                he understood that Italy was entirely ready to agree to such an
                                arrangement with, however, the usual proviso that sanctions first be
                                lifted. He added that this condition prevented Italy immediately
                                taking the initiative. He said that it should be entirely manifest
                                to everyone that Italian policy must now be seen as precluding any
                                possible “designs” against the small Mediterranean states. He said
                                that Italy was further ready to give Great Britain and France
                                guarantees respecting their African interests. He spoke with
                                surprise concerning London’s apparent endeavor to keep
                                British-Italian animosities alive referring to what indeed seems to
                                be a recrudescence of anti-Italian expressions in the British press.
                                He admitted in a guarded manner that sanctions were hurting Italy
                                but said that Great Britain must be blind not to perceive that Italy
                                could not passively permit itself to be worn down by such measures
                                and particularly in view of her recent successes to submit to a
                                “bankers’ victory”. He <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0207"
                                />stated his belief that a continued attempt along these lines would
                                provoke Italy to violent action or at least thrust her entirely
                                toward Germany (he speculated on a possible Italo-German agreement
                                respecting Austria along the lines of the Russo-Rumanian arrangement
                                concerning Bessarabia),<note n="50" xml:id="d146fn50">Perhaps a

                                    specific reference in this convention to Bessarabia, yet there
                                    is the implication that the Soviet Union was committed
                                    supposedly to settle the dispute without resort to aggressions
                                    defined in the convention.</note> He said that he believed that
                                an element in British tactics was to maintain the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >status quo</hi> respecting sanctions and the general League
                                position while Italy weakened and Great Britain gained in strength
                                and in particular that Great Britain preferred that the
                                responsibility for any overt material action lie with the Italians
                                in order to derive therefrom the greatest possible support both from
                                the League and from world opinion. He felt that the situation was
                                drifting toward serious possibilities should Italy be driven
                                desperate by this policy.</p>
                            <p>(3) He further told me that he understood that Rome had not yet
                                accepted the invitation to the Straits Conference<note n="51"

                                    ff.</note> and he believed that such acceptance also depended
                                upon the lifting of sanctions.</p>
                            <p>(4) The Mediterranean representatives here are thus watching with
                                apprehension British and French positions on sanctions. Feeling
                                assured that France favors a Mediterranean adjustment they tell me
                                that their Governments have been endeavoring to persuade Paris to
                                take the initiative. They believe that London is holding Paris back
                                from such action and assert that they have positively ascertained
                                that Eden obtained an assurance from Blum that France would not
                                bring forward in Geneva the lifting of sanctions and that the two
                                reached a tentative agreement to defer the matter of sanctions and
                                the entire Italo-Ethiopian question until the regular assembly, this
                                to be accomplished either by taking pertinent formal action at the
                                Council meeting on June 16 or by not holding the meeting.</p>
                            <p>There are in fact rumors here that the June 16th meeting will not

                                all Italy in asserting Italy’s “undisputed sovereignty over
                                Abyssinia” the exploitation of which will occupy Italian energy for
                                decades; (3) that the sanctions which are not being effective should
                                be withdrawn in which case Italy would participate in the work of
                                any committee set up by the League of Nations to prepare a better
                                security system but if they are not withdrawn Italy will leave the
                                League and this step may “be accompanied by more selective
                                arrangements to guarantee Italian security”.</p>
                            <p>It is noteworthy that Eden saw Grandi<note n="52" xml:id="d147fn52"
                                    >Dino Grandi, Italian Ambassador in the United Kingdom.</note>
                                yesterday and the Foreign Office press bureau gave out that for the
                                first time since the occupation of Addis Ababa some of the problems
                                raised by the present relations of Italy to the other League powers
                                were discussed and that Grandi expressed Mussolini’s desire for
                                better understanding with Great Britain and reiterated the assurance
                                that Italy had no designs against British interests. One of my
                                colleagues understands from Grandi that he personally stressed that
                                sanctions were not penalizing the immediate Italian economic and
                                financial position but driving Italian public opinion and above all
                                the Italian state into a situation similar to that of Germany.</p>

                            <p>182. I am informed that Mussolini has stated that unless the
                                situation changes materially by June 16 especially as regards
                                sanctions and the status of the Negus he will not send a delegation
                                to the meeting of the Council at Geneva but will be represented at
                                the Straits Conference which is scheduled to convene at Montreux on
                                June 22. This latter meeting is looked upon as furnishing an
                                opportunity for discussion of the Abyssinian problem among
                                representatives of the <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0209"
                                />interested European powers and of furthering a possible solution
                                by reaching an agreement on the general Mediterranean problem as a
                                broader basis for understanding.</p>
                            <p>In the meanwhile, there is every indication that the military
                                preparedness in Italy is being maintained and even increased
                                activities in certain branches are reported. The fleet is being kept
                                at the height of preparedness. Increases are reported in aviation
                                equipment and in offices, and it is said that new military airdromes
                                are being developed in the northeast sector. As regards the army, it
                                is reported that several new classes are to be called up and that
                                schools in the Piedmont sector are to be closed so as to be
                                available for barracks and the return to Italy of Marshal Badoglio
                                is looked upon as an indication of intensive activities within the
                                General Staff. In fact, the country appears to be fully established
                                on a war basis and the extent of this preparation combined with the
                                mood engendered by the recent successes in Abyssinia has created a
                                state of mind on the part of Italians which is by no means conducive
                                to an attitude of restraint in the face of what they regard as
                                unjustified opposition.</p>
                            <p>The menace inherent in the present situation cannot be denied.
                                Mussolini has declared that his decisions are irrevocable. He
                                appears to have staked his prestige on maintaining the position
                                which he has established and there is basis for the opinion that any
                                recession from the main lines of that position would be practically
                                impossible. Under that opinion any policy of bluff on his part is
                                excluded for in the last analysis he would have no other course than
                                to make good or try to make good the position which he has declared.
                                Public opinion is firmly behind him. He has achieved more than he
                                promised and has proved to the people the necessity if not the value
                                of the measures which have been adopted in attaining his ends. He
                                has strengthened the regime by recent administrative measures and it
                                is rumored that fresh steps in this direction, both as regards
                                changes in important offices as well as affecting governmental
                                organizations and bodies, may be expected in the near future.
                                Mussolini, it is believed, is looking for a peaceful solution. To
                                that end it is alleged that he is ready to give other countries, and
                                especially England, every assurance that their interests will be
                                amply respected whether in Abyssinia or Egypt or elsewhere, and the
                                Duce himself has declared that Italy, having attained satisfaction,
                                will be fully occupied in exploiting her conquests and will menace
                                the peace of no nation. To effect such a solution, however, would
                                appear to be impossible if the policy of other countries, and of
                                England in particular, is to be predicated upon a consideration of
                                the moral issues involved in Italy’s action in Abyssinia rather than
                                upon a conviction that some solution must be found which will
                                liquidate this particular venture in order <pb n="145"
                                    xml:id="pg_145" facs="0210"/>that nations may bend their efforts
                                towards the reorganization of international relationships on the
                                basic principles which have hitherto been acknowledged and which
                                would preclude a repetition of events similar to the one which has
                                created the present situation. Those who are convinced of the grave
                                danger of what appears to be a present deadlock are hoping that a
                                realistic view of the problem may prevail in order to obviate the
                                pursuit of a policy which, on the one hand, might bring about scenes
                                within Italy of which the consequences cannot be foreseen or, on the
                                other, drive Mussolini to precipitate a general conflict in order to
                                demonstrate his power if only by initial successes.</p>

                                the character and status of the Argentine position respecting the

                            <p>He tells me that several days ago he received instructions to sound
                                out other permanent representatives here concerning such action by
                                Argentina. He stated that although they were definitely not
                                expressing the official views of their governments he found them
                                generally favorable. He mentioned in particular certain Latin
                                American powers although not naming them, the European “neutral”
                                states, Portugal and Poland. He asserted that neither Great Britain,
                                France nor Italy had any advance knowledge of the matter and that
                                “naturally” there had been no approach to Russia. Yesterday he had
                                exposed these developments to Azcárate.<note n="55"
                                    xml:id="d149fn55">Pablo de Azcárate, Deputy Secretary General of

                                matter be made public until it could be further explored but that
                                almost immediately after his conversation at the Secretariat a leak
                                had occurred. He emphasized that it should be distinctly understood
                                that his Government had made no formal <hi rend="italic"
                                    >démarche</hi> whatsoever, that any formal action determined
                                would of course have to be in writing and would have to include the
                                terms of reference of such a demand for a convocation concerning
                                which terms his Government in particular had come to no decision.
                                Possible terms of reference had indeed been <pb n="146"
                                    xml:id="pg_146" facs="0211"/>in part the subject of his
                                conversation with the other representatives here, and had embraced
                                the question of sanctions and the problem of “recognition”. These
                                discussions had naturally impinged at least by direct inference on
                                the whole problem of the “reform” of the League and of the future of
                                the League. His Government envisages the date for such a meeting of
                                the Assembly as before or during the meeting of the Council
                                scheduled for June 16th.</p>
                            <p>(2) It is impossible at the moment to appraise the nature or the
                                results of this development. It may be immediately noted, however,
                                that the list of the powers which Argentina has consulted in advance
                                is a very special one in both its inclusive and exclusive aspects.
                                It represents powers which not being directly concerned are inclined
                                to base their positions on principle. In association with principle
                                it, in a broad sense, further represents as indeed the Argentine
                                Minister expressed it to me a “revolt” of the small powers against
                                the League and themselves being used as an instrument in the
                                policies of the great powers. I think it may readily be seen that
                                Poland also would like to have hand in such a game.</p>
                            <p>How deep are the understandings in this, reached beforehand among the
                                powers, or whether the action of Argentina is in a sense
                                precipitate, is not yet apparent. The position taken by Argentina in
                                the May 12th meeting of the Council should be noted (Consulate’s
                                168, May 12, 9 p.m.) and members of the Secretariat inform me that
                                they are certain that Great Britain and France had felt that
                                Argentina would make some move of this character but that this
                                particular action came to them as a surprise. I think that it may
                                especially be noted that while the urge for such action on the
                                negative side so to speak is fairly evident of the widespreading
                                “dissatisfaction” with the League the possible results on the
                                positive side are not at all evident, and may have unpredictable and
                                far-reaching consequences.</p>
                            <p>To what extent the Argentine action may be motivated by Latin
                                American political considerations is from this point regarded as
                                being a highly probable angle of the picture. The divergence in
                                policy displayed here between Argentina on the one hand and Chile
                                and Ecuador on the other hand is noted and speculation turns on
                                presumable preoccupation of Saavedra Lamas<note n="56"

                                completely aback by this happening. I feel convinced that they had
                                no advance knowledge of it here inasmuch as when I took up the <pb

                                Minister last evening it was evident to me that I was the first to
                                tell him of it. The representatives of the Balkan Entente powers
                                tell me that they have as yet no opinion as to what attitude their
                                Governments will take. The reaction of London and Paris is thus far
                                here entirely a matter of speculation. The neutral power
                                representatives while agreeing to such action in principle gravely
                                question its timeliness. The Italian reaction here, in so far as I
                                can ascertain it, is an extreme annoyance.</p>
                            <p>There is also a general criticism of Argentina’s action as an
                                improper intervention in critical European affairs.</p>
                            <p>(4) The technical situation is that the Assembly stands adjourned
                                subject to the call of the President. Beneš has been informed of
                                this matter. It is believed that as Chief of State he cannot serve
                                and the question seems to be whether a vice president of the
                                Assembly would act or a new president be elected. It is felt,
                                however, that Beneš will keep his status in respect of this open for
                                a time and thus to a degree keep his hand on the situation.</p>

                            <p>183. In an editorial yesterday Gayda reported conflicting
                                interpretations abroad of Argentina’s proposal for the convening of
                                the League Assembly to discuss the two “not necessarily related”
                                questions of sanctions and recognition of Italian sovereignty. He
                                refused to analyze this move both on the ground that Genevan affairs
                                no longer interested Italy except as a basis to future policy and
                                because Argentina’s intentions were not yet clear: that country had
                                voted for but not applied sanctions; on the other hand she not only
                                evinced in contrast to the majority of Latin American opinion a
                                returning sympathy for the League but was also under British
                                financial control. At the same time he remarked that the question of
                                an Assembly meeting was itself confused since Beneš legally should
                                convene it but now being Czechoslovak President he would probably
                                not act as President of the Assembly. Meanwhile, Italy remained
                                completely aloof from Geneva and would not return until the
                                Ethiopian and general situation became entirely clear.</p>
                            <p>As to sanctions the writer said that to continue them, now the war
                                was over, could reveal only petty spite, reprisal leading inevitably
                                to war, or an intention on the part of powers interested in Africa
                                to use sanctions as a lever with which to obtain concessions. In
                                this last <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0213"/>connection he
                                specified that Italy’s early proposal for consultation on the
                                Ethiopian problem had been spurned and that the time for bargaining
                                had now passed: the Empire was irrevocably constituted and there
                                could be no revision of positions or boundaries except for the
                                recognition of a few legitimate foreign rights which could be
                                discussed only in an atmosphere of serenity and peace such as
                                sanctions precluded.</p>

                            <p>119. The Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to me yesterday of the
                                suggestion which he was making to the League of Nations that the
                                Assembly be convened at the earliest possible date to consider the
                                Italian-Ethiopian question. He informed me that previous to
                                advancing this idea the British and French Governments had advised
                                him of their desire that discussion of the whole subject be
                                postponed until September or else October in which latter month the
                                Assembly would meet in regular course. He had replied that he felt
                                this delay would adversely affect the prestige of the League. He
                                said further that if the Assembly was not convened at an early date
                                and the matter arose in the Council, Argentina would refuse to vote
                                there and would make its reasons known. He added that failure of the
                                League to take early action in this case where one member had by
                                violence absorbed another would utterly destroy its moral influence.
                                Continuing the Minister said that some time ago he had suggested to
                                the British Government consideration of the advisability of
                                expelling Italy from the League and that he was told in reply that
                                they could not consider this action since its effect would be to
                                throw Italy into the arms of Germany.</p>
                            <p>I asked what was the present attitude of his Government toward the
                                application of sanctions against Italy. The Foreign Minister replied
                                that Argentina was continuing the application of the sanctions to
                                the extent previously made known although he added the effect of
                                this was nil. With regard to sanctions involving the prohibition of
                                imports from Italy, he said that the request laid before the
                                Congress that it take action on this point was still before that
                                body. The Minister stated further that Argentina would continue to
                                live up to its principles and would vote consistently for these
                                principles in the League of Nations.</p>
                            <p>Reference was made to the impending Pan American Peace Conference.
                                The Minister said that the President of Colombia<note n="58"
                                    xml:id="d151fn58">Alfonso Lopez.</note> … <pb n="149"
                                    xml:id="pg_149" facs="0214"/>had asked him to join in a request
                                for inclusion in the agenda of the Peace Conference the matter of a
                                Pan American League of Nations but that he had declined to do so for
                                the reason, among others, that the request as drawn by the Colombian
                                President contained an attack on the League of Nations of which
                                Argentina is a loyal member. Just here he remarked that the
                                Secretary General of the League of Nations had advised him that it
                                would be well if the Peace Conference might be held in September and
                                prior to the normal meeting date of the League Assembly but that he
                                had not reacted favorably to this.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, and when I thanked him for supplying me with the
                                details relating to Italy’s signature of the anti-war pact, enclosed
                                in my despatch No. 1189 of May 22,<note n="59" xml:id="d151fn59">Not
                                    printed.</note> the Minister said that Italy’s reservations made
                                of its signature “a joke” and that he had so informed the Italian

                            <p>292. The French Ambassador<note n="61" xml:id="d152fn61">André
                                    Charles Corbin.</note> under instructions called early last week
                                on the Foreign Secretary and after referring to the German situation
                                stated that in the opinion of the French Government it was desirable
                                that there should be a realignment of the Western Powers and that
                                France wished to establish a common policy with England in regard to
                                sanctions and the League of Nations and that in order to render this
                                possible the French Government would welcome an expression from the
                                British Government of its views as to the procedure to be followed
                                at the League Council meeting and in any case it would be helpful to
                                have a detailed exposition of British policy with regard to the
                                Italian-Abyssinian situation.</p>
                            <p>At the end of last week the French Embassy was informed by an
                                Assistant Secretary of State that the Cabinet had been unable to
                                reach any agreement on the matters of policy involved (see my 280,
                                May 26, 1 p.m.<note n="59" xml:id="d152fn59">Not printed.</note>)
                                and that it was doubtful whether such decisions <pb n="150"
                                    xml:id="pg_150" facs="0215"/>could be arrived at before the end
                                of this week. Privately and confidentially the Assistant Secretary
                                stated that he felt that the British Government would subsequently
                                require time to consult with the new French Government and that
                                therefore it was probable that the Council meeting of June 16th
                                would have to be postponed for 10 days or more particularly since it
                                was becoming increasingly clear that the question of the
                                continuation of sanctions must arise at that time. Incidentally he
                                added that Grandi’s meeting with Eden (reported in my 288, May 29, 1
                                p.m.) had not added much to Mussolini’s <hi rend="italic">Daily
                                    Telegraph</hi> interview which was inconclusive.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly the French Ambassador left Saturday for Paris to discuss
                                the situation with the incoming government but he is returning
                                tomorrow since the Foreign Office states today that it will have a
                                memorandum of reply to discuss with him then. However, the French
                                Chargé d’Affaires believes that this memorandum will not contain
                                decisive information but will permit the British Cabinet to indicate
                                that they have communicated with the French and in turn have asked
                                certain questions of the French Government.</p>
                            <p>The French Ambassador considers Blum to be an advocate of close
                                cooperating with England more especially in support of the League
                                and at the same time advocating the summoning of a disarmament
                                conference to attempt “real disarmament”. The French Ambassador has
                                pointed out that such a course would be embarrassing to the British
                                Government at the present stage of its rearmament activity and
                                argued that the summoning of such a conference without elaborate and
                                satisfactory diplomatic preparation would probably have a disastrous
                                result.</p>
                            <p>The French Ambassador telephoning from Paris today stated that the
                                incoming government was so concerned with the internal situation
                                that it was inconceivable that it would be prepared to give early
                                consideration to the above or in fact to take any active
                                far-reaching steps in international affairs for the moment.</p>

                                12, 9 p.m.) and to the desirability of democratizing the Council
                                functions and it stresses the necessity for all League members to
                                have an opportunity of considering the problems arising out of the
                                Italian-Ethiopian dispute and of assuming their responsibilities

                                “unchanging tradition” of Pan-Americanism and indicating as the
                                purpose for the Assembly the questions of the annexation of Ethiopia

                            <p>I had luncheon today with Mr. Felix Morley, Editor of <hi
                                    rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi>. Mr. Morley’s new
                                assistant editor and Mr. Yost of my Office were present. Mr. Morley
                                has just returned from a visit to England where he had a
                                three-quarters of an hour interview with Mr. Eden and conversations
                                with various other figures in British public life.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Eden informed Mr. Morley that he did not believe that the present
                                moment was the proper time to initiate any change in the Covenant of
                                the League; he did not feel that any steps of this sort would be
                                taken before the autumn meeting of the Assembly. He said that he was
                                unable to make any prediction as to when sanctions against Italy
                                would be lifted or to forecast the attitude of the new French
                                Government towards such action. Mr. Eden indicated, however, that
                                the British Government would have been prepared to close the Suez
                                Canal last autumn if it could have secured the necessary support
                                from the other sanctionist powers. In reply to a question as to the
                                attitude of England in case of German action against Czechoslovakia,
                                he said that, while the British Government would naturally be
                                greatly concerned at any violation of the Covenant of the League in
                                any part of the world, it would not feel the same responsibility in
                                regard to developments in Central Europe as it would toward
                                developments along Germany’s western frontier, where Great Britain
                                had definite treaty obligations.</p>
                            <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0217"/>
                            <p>In a discussion of the British rearmament program, Mr. William
                                Henderson, son of Mr. Arthur Henderson, informed Mr. Morley that,
                                while the Labor Party was glad that it was not itself obliged to
                                take the responsibility for this step, it was nevertheless convinced
                                of its necessity and was prepared to support the program to the
                                limit. Other members of the Labor Party, including Mr. Hugh Dalton,
                                Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the last Labor Cabinet,
                                expressed deep regret that Great Britain had not taken vigorous
                                action against Italy last autumn and blocked Mussolini at the
                                outset. They did not seem inclined to blame the United States or any
                                other power for the failure of sanctions but felt that the principal
                                responsibility lay at the door of the British Government.</p>

                            <p>460. With reference to the expected meeting of the Assembly of the
                                League about the 29th of this month as a result of the Argentine
                                initiative, we were told at the Foreign Office today that they feel
                                that while there may be a majority at [<hi rend="italic">of</hi>]
                                the states represented at the Assembly in favor of lifting
                                sanctions, there certainly will be no serious move for recognition
                                of Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia and that a debate on this
                                latter question in which representatives of some 50 nations may take
                                part “will only complicate the matter”.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the Argentine initiative, views have been expressed in
                                the press here to the effect that this step may have been taken at
                                the instigation of other powers. It is the view of the Foreign
                                Office, however, that it was dictated solely by motives arising out
                                of Argentina’s continental policy reinforced by Saavedra Lamas’
                                well-known desire to play a great role on the international
                                scene.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the conversations which are reported to be taking place
                                looking to a possible understanding between Germany and Italy, the
                                Foreign Office believes “that there is something in it” but feels
                                that Mussolini will not commit himself to anything at least until
                                after he has had an opportunity to judge the results of the
                                Assembly’s action on the question of Ethiopia and that of
                                sanctions.</p>

                            <p>299. My 292, June 2, 5 p.m. The French Ambassador returned to London
                                the middle of this week and after conversations with Eden returned
                                to Paris yesterday. The Foreign Secretary discussed with him
                                questions of procedure for the League Assembly meeting at the end of
                                this month and added that the Argentine Ambassador had informed him
                                that his Government had formally requested this convocation of the
                                Assembly since it was essential that the Latin-American countries
                                members of the League should have their legal obligations to the
                                League, and especially the matter of sanctions, clearly defined
                                before the forthcoming Buenos Aires Conference.</p>
                            <p>I am informed the Foreign Secretary gave no indication to the French
                                Ambassador that there was as yet unanimity of opinion in the Cabinet
                                on the Anglo-Italian issues but explained that in the present
                                situation it was difficult to maintain a position on purely moral
                                grounds, and likewise equally difficult before large sections of
                                British public opinion to appear to compromise on principles.
                                Accordingly at League discussions on sanctions England would
                                presumably have no proposals to initiate, but if other nations moved
                                for the abolition of sanctions and such a policy was endorsed by the
                                French Government, England’s attitude would not be obstructive. My
                                French colleague pointed out to me that this statement of Eden was
                                of the utmost importance to Blum who has been anticipating a lead
                                from the British Government, which he would be prepared to follow.
                                Accordingly the French Ambassador was now in Paris consulting the
                                new Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                            <p>On Wednesday Eden had a further interview with the Italian Ambassador
                                (see my 280 [<hi rend="italic">288</hi>] of May 29, 1 p.m.) and the
                                latter was full of pleasant things to say regarding his Government’s
                                foreign policy and Mussolini’s desire to reconstruct the Stresa
                                front. I understand the Foreign Secretary ascertained that the
                                Italian Ambassador already had some knowledge of the British
                                Government’s present outlook in regard to sanctions as outlined
                                above. Eden then went on to remind the Italian Ambassador of the
                                difficulties of the situation in dealings with Italy until that
                                country had made some gesture or overture towards meeting the
                                position of the League of Nations in the matter.</p>

                            <p>With the above indications of the trend of British policy in Italian
                                League matters the formal announcement today of Sir Samuel Hoare’s

                            <p>Yesterday Eden paid a short visit to the Ethiopian Emperor at the
                                latter’s temporary residence. I understand the conversation was very
                                general except that Eden cautioned the Emperor as to preserving his
                                incognito while he remained in England. Today the Ethiopian Minister
                                is giving a reception to meet “The Emperor of Ethiopia”. It is
                                understood that so far only the Chiefs of Mission of certain eastern
                                countries have accepted, China, Turkey, Persia, and Afghanistan. The
                                invitation addressed to the American Ambassador was returned with a
                                note explaining the Ambassador’s absence in America and since no
                                subsequent invitation has been issued to me as Chargé d’Affaires I
                                shall not attend.</p>

                                inter-American policy of the Argentines in convoking the Assembly I
                                have considered it prudent while holding myself receptive to refrain
                                from pursuing inquiries of the Argentines and in general among Latin
                                American delegations here. The Argentine representative however
                                “declared” to me that Argentine’s pertinent policy is to obtain here
                                the strongest possible indorsement of the “principle of
                                nonrecognition.” He added that while his instructions respecting the
                                position he should take on sanctions were not final Argentine policy
                                in general should the question arise was to abstain on a vote to
                                maintain or to increase sanctions and to vote for the lifting of
                                sanctions should there be any substantial movement in that
                                direction.</p>

                            <p>302. Confidential[ly] in outlining today the trend of their present
                                deliberations the Foreign Office referred to the practical[ity of]
                                merging the Council meeting into the greater meeting of the Assembly
                                at the end of this month and gave me to understand that England
                                would favor the abolition of sanctions under the cover of this
                                meeting of many nations. The difficulty in the interim lay in
                                meeting the viewpoints being expressed by the small powers
                                especially Greece and Turkey. The abolition of sanctions, the
                                Foreign Office emphasized, was a separate question which did not
                                concern the recognition of Abyssinia in which Italian League
                                situation Italy must take the initiative in making some gesture
                                toward meeting the position of the League. If sanctions are
                                abolished and the way clear to the reestablishment of Italy in the
                                League the Foreign Office thought that the Straits Conference would
                                then assume its “justly limited importance.” Foreign Office seemed
                                unenthusiastic about League reorganization fearing such an attempt
                                would merely end in the destruction of the existing Covenant.</p>
                            <p>The French Ambassador returned from Paris last night and I understand
                                does not feel the new Government has had any time to study its
                                theories in the light of the existing situation. Observers following
                                events are fearful lest with the French and British both far from
                                anxious to take any lead at Geneva a situation of drift may
                                ensue.</p>

                            <p>223. Consulate’s 218, June 6, 3 p.m. The Argentine representative
                                called on me unexpectedly today and said that he wished to give me
                                confidentially an exposé of his Government’s policy in requesting a
                                convocation of the Assembly. The essence of what he had to say is as
                                follows.</p>
                            <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0221"/>
                            <p>1. Argentina is seeking the widest possible support for the
                                nonrecognition principle embodied in the Saavedra Lamas Pact.<note
                                    n="67" xml:id="d159fn67">See footnote 57, <ref target="#pg_146"
                                        >p. 146</ref>.</note> For this Council action, even if
                                obtainable, would not have fully answered the purpose. The broader
                                representation in the Assembly was manifestly preferable. In a sense
                                Argentina feels its policy already achieved through a meeting of the
                                Assembly being assured inasmuch as it makes little difference to her
                                whether an indorsement of the principle is obtained through the
                                medium of a resolution or through speeches. They feel a certainty
                                that any form of expression must perforce be favorable.</p>
                            <p>The publicity following the leak respecting the diplomatic soundings
                                they had made which I discussed in my 202, May 30, 6 p.m., forced a
                                crystallization of the issue favorable to Argentina. For example,
                                Chile was at about that time considering a convocation of the
                                Assembly by joint action of a number of Latin-American states the
                                agenda to include, in association with the Italo-Ethiopian question,
                                that of revision of the Covenant. Argentina, however, desired to
                                capture and hold the sole initiative respecting the acceptance of
                                the nonrecognition policy antecedent to the Buenos Aires Conference.
                                A certain degree of friction with Chile has developed over this. The
                                Chilean delegation has made public here the Santiago memorandum of
                                May 18.<note n="68" xml:id="d159fn68">This memorandum presented

                            <p>He told me that although certain of their diplomatic representatives
                                had been instructed to make soundings they were told to do so under
                                the guise of casually voicing their personal speculations and that
                                no states either American or European had been associated in the
                                project. He circumstantially described the surprise of the Quai
                                d’Orsay and Eden’s discomfiture and extreme irritation when it was
                                disclosed to him.</p>
                            <p>He fully recognizes the political effects of the prevalent belief
                                that London and Buenos Aires were partners in the project adding
                                that this belief cannot now be disabused because London has become
                                favorable to an Assembly meeting. The reason for London’s favorable
                                attitude he described as based on internal and external political
                                considerations almost precisely as I described them in my No. 214,

                                him by the Argentine Embassy at London and also received from

                                and who apparently is directing in Europe the execution of Argentine
                                policy in these respects.</p>
                            <p>In regard to sanctions Buenos Aires has now determined its policy.
                                    <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0222"/>Although regretting the
                                necessity of associating the principle of nonrecognition with that
                                of sanctions and also frankly hopeful that sanctions may be dropped,
                                they are nevertheless “caught” by what they state to be the
                                concurrence of these principles (articles 2 and 1) in the Saavedra
                                Lamas Pact. Thus Argentina must perforce vote for the maintenance of
                                sanctions should the question come to a vote. Their tactics are
                                however to prevent it coming to a vote.</p>
                            <p>He referred to article 3 of the treaty as the “sanctions article”.
                                This position he has taken in his discussions with Latin-American
                                representatives here and has furnished them with copies of a
                                publication issued by the Argentine Embassy at Washington dated
                                September, 1932, containing a commentary<note n="71"

                                which reference to article 3 will be noted. Without venturing to
                                appraise this interpretation I can definitely state that Argentina
                                is advancing it here.</p>
                            <p>He has been working for support of the Argentine initiative among
                                Latin-American representatives and informs me that their present
                                attitudes are as follows. Bolivia will collaborate fully with
                                Argentina including the policy respecting sanctions. Mexico, Peru
                                and Uruguay will generally follow Argentina’s initiative. Chile had
                                agreed to support the convoking of an Assembly and presumably must
                                indorse the nonrecognition policy. Colombia, Cuba and Venezuela will
                                support Argentina in principle. He added that in view of Brazil’s
                                declaration of nonrecognition respecting Abyssinia he feels that he
                                has Brazil’s moral support here among the Latin-Americans. I cannot
                                overemphasize that running through our entire conversation the
                                American aspects of the policy were solely evident, the European
                                aspects being completely brushed aside and apparently having no play
                                in the policy involved.</p>
                            <p>2. He stated to me that presumably Espil<note n="72"
                                    xml:id="d159fn72">Felipe A. Espil, Argentine Ambassador in the
                                    United States.</note> had discussed these matters with the
                                Department but at the same time he particularly requested that both
                                the circumstance and the substance of his disclosures to me be kept
                                strictly confidential. I would thus appreciate the Department’s
                                fully protecting my source.</p>
                            <p>3. I find the reaction in Geneva to the Argentine initiative to be
                                substantially as follows: <list>

                                        Latin-Americans share this feeling also declaring
                                        Argentina’s action to be inconsistent with the

                                continue to evidence extreme anxiety for the consummation of a
                                Mediterranean pact reflect with pessimism the situation described in

                                disappointingly reluctant to take the initiative which they
                                attribute to a desire to employ sanctions as a bargaining point.
                                Rome is reassuring them that with or without a pact Italy has no
                                aggressive designs on them. Rome at the same time intimates that not
                                only will she not negotiate in any way under pressure of sanctions
                                but will even avoid the aspect of so doing and is in no hurry
                                whatsoever to proceed in the matter. The Balkan Ministers interpret
                                the attitudes of the two governments as productive of long delays
                                and are fearful that some development may intervene to prevent the
                                pact’s achievement. They credit Mussolini’s assurances of having no
                                aggressive intentions particularly because they believe that they
                                are borne out by the limitations of Italy’s immediate material
                                situation. From a long range view, however, they ardently desire a
                                definitive Mediterranean settlement guaranteed by Great Britain and
                                France.</p>

                            <p>The House, which was in a highly skeptical mood at the beginning of
                                his speech, eventually settled down and apart from the extreme labor
                                elements seemed disposed to consider seriously the arguments
                                advanced.</p>
                            <p>I understand from an official of the Labor Party that the Prime
                                Minister approached the labor leaders in an attempt to achieve a
                                united policy respecting the abolition of sanctions. This came to
                                nothing because of labor’s conditions that such abolition must be
                                accompanied by Great Britain’s advocacy of the expulsion of Italy
                                from the League, with an undertaking by the states members to
                                refrain from giving credit facilities to Italy. A similar attempt
                                has been made over a period of time to create a common front on
                                rearmament but the Labor Party has been unwilling to agree unless
                                the Government came out publicly for a policy indicating that some
                                rearmament was in effect against Germany and that in cooperation
                                with the French and Soviets, it would regard any violation of the
                                territory of the states surrounding Germany as a <hi rend="italic"

                                new First Lord of the Admiralty today Sir Samuel Hoare stated that
                                he might tell his people “not to get it into their heads that we
                                have any intention of weakening our position in the Mediterranean
                                for that is not correct; in fact we intend to strengthen our
                                position there”.</p>

                            <p>220. The first reaction among Foreign Office officials to Eden’s
                                    speech<note n="78" xml:id="d162fn78">See <hi rend="italic"
                                        >supra</hi>.</note> is one of gratification in so far as the
                                references to sanctions are concerned, although a certain sense of
                                disappointment is noted in that no reference was made therein to the
                                eventual renewal of cooperation by Italy in the problems confronting
                                Europe. They also are apparently disturbed by Eden’s reaffirmation
                                of the naval accords among the Mediterranean countries. This
                                reference, however, I understand from British circles, was intended
                                to reassure the smaller Mediterranean countries who are in fear of
                                future aggression on the part of Italy and may be explained on that
                                basis.</p>
                            <p>The possible developments in the Geneva meetings at the end of the
                                month are still a source of anxiety to the Italians. From British
                                sources I understand that efforts have been made by England in
                                informal negotiation between representatives of the British and
                                Argentine Governments to dissuade Argentina from insisting at the
                                Assembly on a declaration of nonrecognition of Italian sovereignty
                                over Ethiopia and to agree to a compromise on the basis of the
                                reaffirmation for the future of the doctrine of nonrecognition of
                                territory acquired by force and of the appointment of a commission
                                to study and report on the conditions in Ethiopia with special
                                reference to eventual recognition of Italian sovereignty. This
                                commission would not hand down its report for approximately 6
                                months.</p>
                            <p>It is apparently accepted as settled that the Italian Government will
                                submit a statement to the League and that it will include assurances
                                as to the recruiting of a black army in East Africa, the protection
                                of the native population, and the safeguarding of foreign interests
                                there. It is also said that the Italian Government may agree to
                                report to the League on the foregoing matters from time to time.</p>

                            <p>246. 1. The chief points in the situation here respecting the June 30
                                Assembly appear to be as follows:</p>
                            <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0226"/>
                            <p>Argentina plans to be represented by its Ambassadors at Rome and at
                                London and by Guiñazú.<note n="79" xml:id="d163fn79">José María
                                    Cantilo, Manuel E. Malbrán, Enrique Ruíz-Guiñazú,
                                    respectively.</note> The latter informs me in confidence that
                                his Government’s position now is that the question of “old
                                sanctions” which covers all action taken by the League, leading to
                                and including the application of article 16, is something entirely
                                separate from that of “new sanctions” under article 10. He declared
                                that Argentina’s attitude respecting the former is one of
                                “indifference,” but, respecting the latter, that her policy of
                                nonrecognition is “insistent and irrevocable.” He disclosed to me,
                                however, that Argentina is prepared to be satisfied by support in
                                some form of the policy of nonrecognition and to leave to a later
                                date the possible application of it to Abyssinia. He frankly
                                admitted to me that the theory of a difference between old sanctions
                                and new sanctions was a device to justify the quashing of the old
                                sanctions.</p>
                            <p>2. It is obvious that a reconciliation of the probable course of
                                events with the provisions and the evident intent of the Covenant
                                will be a difficult if not an impossible undertaking. The present
                                effort from the strictly League viewpoint is to arrive at
                                prearranged formulae as palatable as possible to League and world
                                opinion and such as could receive “acceptance” in at least some form
                                by the League.</p>
                            <p>To what extent the procedures and formulae which are taking shape
                                here are advanced or have received any general acceptance by the
                                powers including Italy, I am unable to determine. By the same token
                                it is difficult to forecast what may transpire.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine position described above has all the characteristics of
                                a “negotiated” arrangement and the composition of the Argentine
                                delegation is suggestive in scope. Although the “atmosphere” of
                                negotiation certainly exists among the League great powers nothing
                                positive respecting them yet emerges in Geneva. The crux of the
                                problem seems to lie in the interpretation of the British position,
                                that is whether it fits into negotiated arrangements or whether
                                Eden’s speech occurring prior to the Assembly means that Great
                                Britain desires to achieve the tactical advantage of being the first
                                to disassociate itself from commitments and thus be free to maneuver
                                for the middle position, the traditional keystone of British policy.
                                The best opinion here leans to the latter view. In general, I feel
                                that while the action here will denote a common will for an
                                appeasement, any appraisal of it as indicative of a specific plan of
                                European settlement should be regarded with reserve.</p>
                            <p>3. The best indications here point, however, to the following course
                                of events in the Council Assembly meeting.</p>
                            <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0227"/>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Sanctions—Open discussion will be as far
                                as possible avoided. A committee meeting in private will formulate a
                                statement of the “existing facts” leaving action to the individual
                                state.</p>
                            <p>While it is not considered probable, except as a tactical move, that
                                any state will oppose the lifting of sanctions there exists here
                                among small state delegations an extreme resentment at, as they
                                described it, having been used by the powers particularly by Great
                                Britain under the guise of League action as a tool in great power
                                politics and a declared resistiveness to any tendency of London to
                                divert responsibility for the present situation to Geneva. A voicing
                                of these sentiments might render difficult the accomplishment of a
                                planned program; but in recent experience similar attitudes of the
                                small powers have not reached formal utterance.</p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Nonrecognition—An attempt will be made to
                                confine this question to speeches or statements of principle and to
                                avoid anything in the nature of a decision by disposing of it
                                through reference for study to a committee of jurists.</p>
                            <p>The Russians have privately advanced the thesis that the cases of
                                Manchukuo and Abyssinia are not parallel inasmuch as in the former,
                                China was a recognized government, whereas in the latter, the
                                government has disappeared.</p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) League Reform—My personal view is that a
                                preliminary discussion of this question may be merged into the
                                liquidation of the present situation in order to smother the
                                disrupting effects of such liquidation in an appeal for unified
                                support of a new endeavor. Even if it be not so planned, the issue
                                may be launched by some small state delegation, possibly by Chile,
                                which in Latin American circles is believed to be anxious to assume
                                a role here in emulation of Argentina.</p>
                            <p>4. A situation without precedent prevails in what it is beginning to
                                be regarded here as a European-American issue, the European endeavor
                                being in general terms to employ the Assembly to liquidate the
                                Italian-European situation and the alleged American endeavor being
                                to employ the Assembly chiefly as a springboard for positions at the
                                Buenos Aires Conference.</p>

                                conversation the following was brought out:</p>
                            <p>1. The Emperor is proceeding to Geneva. He will not, however, <pb

                                procedures, Ethiopia being represented by the Secretary of Legation
                                at London assisted by Jèze.<note n="81" xml:id="d164fn81">Gaston
                                    Jèze, professor of law at the University of Paris, legal counsel
                                    for the Ethiopian delegation at the League of Nations.</note>
                                Their statements will be along the lines previously taken. Ethiopia
                                is taking this action inasmuch as it is the only course left open,
                                and while entirely pessimistic as to the outcome, they feel that in
                                a complicated political situation something unforeseen may develop
                                in their favor. They have no specific knowledge that any delegation
                                will support them, but envisage that possibility.</p>
                            <p>They estimate that the Italians have effectively occupied something
                                over half of Abyssinia. The Emperor has dispatched Prince Makonen to
                                Abyssinia to continue resistance which he believes can be effective,
                                or at least harassing, until the end of the rainy season inasmuch as
                                the chief weapons of the Italians, aeroplanes and mustard gas,
                                cannot be employed during the rains. The despatch of Makonen is also
                                a tactical move in connection with the presentation of their case in
                                Geneva. He is, however, proceeding via the Sudan and as the British
                                have interdicted the passage of arms to Abyssinia through the Sudan
                                it is possible the British will not let him through.</p>
                            <p>2. Colson believes, however, as do I, that this will mark the last
                                official appearance of the Ethiopians in Geneva and that by the time
                                of the September assembly the League will not recognize Ethiopia as
                                a member state.</p>

                            <p>249. 1. In a conversation with the Argentine representative today,
                                with a frankness which surprised me he expressed himself in the
                                following sense respecting the Argentine policy of nonrecognition.
                                He then said that he had reason to believe that a conflict existed
                                between Washington and Buenos Aires over this matter, the United
                                States while recognizing the desirability of its application in
                                specific cases was opposed to the principle of its universal
                                applicability. I remarked with entire truth that I did not know of
                                my Government’s position on this question. He then went on to say
                                that despite the United States tacit opposition Argentina feels
                                confident, particularly in view of Washington’s being still tied to
                                the Stimson doctrine,<note n="82" xml:id="d165fn82">See telegram No.

                                Conference and that Argentina does not desire any diminution of

                            <p>1. The representatives of the “neutral” states held a meeting here
                                last evening. I am informed confidentially by participants that the
                                following transpired concerning the chief points at issue.</p>
                            <p>Sanctions—Unanimity of view that sanctions must be discarded; <pb
                                    n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0230"/>recognition in fact that
                                since the British action<note n="84" xml:id="d167fn84">Announcement
                                    by Anthony Eden, June 18, 1936, that the British would not
                                    support continuance of sanctions. See telegram No. 315, June 18,
                                    1936, 6 p.m. from the Chargé in the United Kingdom, <ref
                                        target="#pg_158">p. 158</ref>.</note> there is no other
                                course to follow. A consensus of opinion that the lifting of
                                sanctions must be simultaneous and that an agreement to that effect
                                should somehow be obtained; this is felt to be just and necessary to
                                prevent states obtaining advantages from Italy in return for early
                                individual action. Considerable resentment was displayed over the
                                circumstance that London which had by private representations urged
                                them to impose sanctions had accorded them no prior information
                                concerning its recent action; coupled with this was a belief that
                                Great Britain may have acquired some concession from Italy on the
                                strength of that separate action.</p>
                            <p>As a corollary to the foregoing the question of Italian “counter
                                sanctions” was discussed. The idea was advanced of obtaining some
                                undertakings from Italy that she would not practice discrimination
                                against or between sanctionist states once the measures are
                                abolished. Ciano’s statement that a return to pre-sanction channels
                                of trade would be a delayed process was disturbing and lent color to
                                the suspicion that “powers” had already obtained special
                                concessions. Consideration of what might be done by the small powers
                                to protect their interests in these respects was left open, but it
                                was generally felt that nothing tangible could be accomplished.</p>
                            <p>Nonrecognition—Although certain representatives demurred on
                                principle, it was generally felt that nothing could be gained and
                                only irritation would result by raising the question of
                                nonrecognition respecting Abyssinia. In particular, there was a
                                complete lack of knowledge of what Argentina would propose and it
                                was thus felt that decisions as to their positions must await
                                Argentine action and Assembly developments immediately subsequent
                                thereto.</p>
                            <p>League Reform—It was generally agreed that it was too early to
                                consider specific projects. It was felt, nevertheless, desirable
                                that the question should “seriously” be placed before the
                                governments during the current meetings in order that it might
                                definitely be considered in September.</p>
                            <p>2. In another meeting this morning the general opinion was opposed to
                                juridical reform of the Covenant but favorable to facilitating
                                action under the Covenant by new procedural or mechanical
                                arrangements.</p>
                            <p>3. Indications here are that the British policy respecting sanctions
                                will be supported by all the dominions except South Africa. The
                                South African representative who told a member of my staff that his
                                Government was extremely displeased with the British position went
                                    <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0231"/>so far as to say that
                                South Africa would stand for the maintenance of sanctions even if it
                                were the only state to do so and even if that involved a public
                                split with London.</p>

                            <p>255. The Cuban Minister has just called on me and shown me a telegram
                                from his Government stating that the Argentine Minister at Habana
                                had solicited Cuban support in the Assembly and instructing him to
                                accord such support. The telegram added that Cuba favored the policy
                                of nonrecognition and the discarding of sanctions.</p>
                            <p>He is telegraphing his Government urging that they instruct him

                            <p>443. The following observations are based on recent conversations
                                with diplomatic colleagues.</p>
                            <p>The British Minister<note n="86" xml:id="d169fn86">Sir Sidney
                                    Barton.</note> came to see me several times before his departure
                                and said he was thoroughly discouraged by the turn affairs had
                                taken. Mussolini had not only scored a great victory over Ethiopia,
                                but an even greater one over Geneva and London. Great Britain
                                [apparent omission] with a good deal of patience and generosity been
                                carrying the chief burden of responsibility throughout the recent
                                unprecedented crisis and had failed dismally. When I asked to what
                                causes he attributed this failure he [apparent omission] France was
                                probably chiefly to blame because she proved the staunchest friend
                                Italy had in the sanctionist camp. Her whole aim was to gain time
                                and she therefore seized on every chance of delay to prevent the
                                imposing of an oil embargo or the further extension of any other
                                sanctions. But he also blamed Downing Street for sharing with France
                                the fiasco of the <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0232"/>December

                                authority and prestige, not only in Europe, but apparently also in
                                the United States. Although Eden’s appointment was intended to
                                restore confidence he had not done much better than Hoare, the
                                contradictions in British foreign policy continued and England
                                ceased to offer a definite lead.</p>
                            <p>Sir Sidney was very anxious about the future. The guiding rules of
                                British foreign policy had for 16 years been founded on loyalty to
                                the ideals of the League and the Paris Pact and this winter had made
                                great efforts to vindicate the system of collective security. This
                                policy had received the fullest indorsement of public opinion both
                                in England and in the Dominions. But what was the use of standing by
                                the League when the other principal powers had either deserted it or
                                were not prepared to fight for it? The risks were too great and
                                might prove fatal to the Empire.</p>
                            <p>I then asked what he thought Great Britain’s policy would be, and he
                                replied that he doubted whether it had yet taken shape. British
                                public opinion would undoubtedly like to see the Foreign Office take
                                a firm line vis-à-vis Mussolini and to preserve and strengthen if
                                possible a system of collective security. The Empire is quite united
                                in support of the rule of law as opposed to force and probably feels
                                that merely because article 16 of the Covenant did not work the
                                whole League need not be scrapped.</p>
                            <p>To a further question Sir Sidney replied that in conservative circles
                                there was a surplus of desire to limit Great Britain’s commitments
                                abroad to a minimum, for example the defense of France and Belgium,
                                for at heart the average Englishman hates and dreads European
                                entanglements almost as much as the American. But England’s
                                proximity to the Continent made it impossible for her to keep
                                entirely aloof and the only substitute for the League of Nations
                                were regional agreements for mutual protection. Whether Great
                                Britain would like France orientate her policy further away from the
                                League and rely more upon a system of alliances, would, of course
                                depend on what happened to the League.</p>
                            <p>I gathered from the British Minister’s remarks that he and his
                                Government felt humiliated by the complete defeat of British demand
                                in the Italo-Ethiopian conflict. The international situation has
                                been immensely aggravated by Mussolini’s triumphant treaty-breaking
                                and has changed its diplomatic and strategic aspects to Great
                                Britain’s disadvantage. British opinion is perplexed by the host of
                                irksome problems arising out of this new situation. Italy’s
                                occupation of the <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0233"/>Lake
                                Tsana region does not seem to worry them much but they are genuinely
                                alarmed at the threat to their Mediterranean interests. They have
                                been watching with growing uneasiness Italy’s naval and air
                                preparations which they believe are intended to menace British
                                communications with India and East Africa, her oil supplies from the
                                Middle East, and her naval supremacy in general. Mussolini’s
                                insensate and bombastic desire to demonstrate the present day
                                superiority of Italian arms may lead Italy farther and farther
                                afield and finally tempt her to look for expansion at the expense of
                                the British Empire.</p>
                            <p>In order to be prepared for a veritable struggle for the mastery of
                                the Mediterranean, the British Government is obliged to revise its
                                entire policy toward the maintenance of peace in Europe—either by
                                reorganizing the League so as to make it more formidable or by
                                virtually ceasing to count upon its effective functioning. In either
                                event the British now realize that they must be strong enough to
                                defend peace and to enforce international obligations. Hence the
                                present British preparedness campaign which is to rearm the Empire
                                to such an extent that irresponsible dictators will be obliged to
                                pause before they yield to the temptation of upsetting the existing
                                world order.</p>
                            <p>The French Minister, Monsieur Bodard, has been placed in a peculiar
                                position by the results of the Socialist victory in France. The
                                French Legation, though not so much the Minister personally, had
                                been notoriously pro-Italian throughout the conflict and seemed
                                pleased with the failure of sanctions and the collapse of Ethiopian
                                military resistance. Italy’s aggression was always glossed over and
                                the necessity emphasized of localizing the African war and
                                preventing its spreading to Europe and perhaps becoming another
                                world threat. But since the French elections and the Italian
                                annexation a complete <hi rend="italic">volte face</hi> has been
                                noticeable, all members of the Legation professing with amusing
                                unanimity to be very suspicious of Italian aims and expressing great
                                anxiety regarding the future of Djibouti and the French railway.</p>
                            <p>In discussing the European situation with the Minister the other day
                                I inquired whether the Blum Government would be inclined to maintain
                                sanctions against Italy. Bodard replied he doubted it very much
                                because the Covenant did not seem to provide for punitive sanctions
                                when the state of war for which they were imposed had come to an
                                end. At least he thought it would require a fresh decision by the
                                Council of the League. The French Left Wing—like the British Labor
                                Party or the Soviets—hates Fascism more than it loves Ethiopia and
                                is too conversant with the realities to embark upon any quixotic
                                adventures for the purpose of saving either the League or Italy’s
                                victim. And as between Mussolini and Hitler the French <pb n="169"
                                    xml:id="pg_169" facs="0234"/>people were far more afraid of the
                                latter’s next move. Defense against Germany would always be their
                                paramount consideration and that is why they would necessarily put
                                loyalty to the League after concern for Stresa.</p>
                            <p>However, France was sincerely desirous of seeing the collective
                                security system survive and men like Herriot, Pietri, Manus and
                                Bastid had always advocated close cooperation with them and the
                                League. If only they had made it clear at Stresa in the spring of
                                1935 when Italy was already pouring troops into East Africa, that if
                                war resulted she would insist on the application of sanctions,
                                Mussolini would not have dared to ignore the warning. Another
                                mistake the British made was their hesitation and lack of precision
                                in giving assurances to France regarding cooperation if Germany,
                                whose military power was rapidly being restored should, for example,
                                attack Austria or Poland. Considering that the League had done
                                nothing when Italy bombarded Corfu in 1923 and when Japan seized
                                Manchuria in 1931, British promises in the event of unprovoked
                                aggression in Central Europe did not carry as much weight as they
                                should. On the contrary France gave the impression that England was
                                constantly condoning German breaches of the military clauses of the
                                Versailles Treaty and was evidently reconciling herself to Hitler’s
                                diplomatic shock tactics.</p>
                            <p>If the British Government has decided not to intervene when
                                Versailles engagements are overturned by force it can hardly be
                                surprised if France hesitates to shoulder responsibilities which are
                                not of immediate concern to her. There seemed to be a certain amount
                                of elastic opportunism in British policy (as seen for example in the
                                naval accord with Germany) which is not easily understood in France.
                                Nevertheless France was today more than ever ready to collaborate
                                with Great Britain in a spirit of compromise and realism and to try
                                and achieve some concrete results. By the imminent collapse of the
                                sanctionist front and with it the collapse of the collective
                                security system both France and England had lost much moral standing
                                especially among the small nations but perhaps by remoulding the
                                League it might still be possible to salvage something of the
                                collective ideal.</p>
                            <p>My German colleague Dr. Strohm is, unlike his predecessor, (see my
                                125, March 1 [<hi rend="italic">3</hi>])<note n="88"
                                    xml:id="d169fn88">Not printed.</note> a confirmed
                                cynic—presumably because he spent most of his career in his own
                                Foreign Office. In recent chats with me he did not conceal his
                                satisfaction at the outcome of the Abyssinian war not because of the
                                defeat of Ethiopia, towards whom the Germans were friendly disposed,
                                but because of Italy’s victory over the League of Nations and all of
                                the sham it stood for. And if Mussolini gained a great deal more
                                kudos than he expected, the League <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170"
                                    facs="0235"/>powers have only their sanctions to thank for it.
                                He had called their bluff of collective action and had won. As far
                                as Germany was concerned the old Versailles League with all its
                                vindictiveness was now bankrupt and dead and it was doubtful whether
                                even France would succeed in reviving it for the sole purpose of
                                creating an anti-German front. Germany had always distrusted the
                                aims of collective security and sanctions and feared until the last
                                that England might succeed in inducing France to join in military
                                sanctions against Italy in return for similar support against
                                Germany. The League’s failure to curb Italy proved the futility of
                                high sounding phrases [apparent omission] even illegalize treaties
                                if they run counter to national ambitions and interests.</p>
                            <p>I asked whether there was a possibility of a genuine <hi
                                    rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> between Great Britain and
                                Germany. He replied very emphatically that there was, in the first
                                place because the Germans really admired the British Government very
                                much and had always regretted that the Kaiser did not take British
                                overtures more seriously, and in the second place because England
                                could usually be depended on to act with a kind of enlightened
                                self-interest. Now that Eden had come down from the clouds of moral
                                indignation it would be much easier to talk business with him.
                                British opinion was really not unfriendly toward the German people
                                and the British Government had shown itself responsive to the
                                aspirations of the “have nots” by trying to remove fundamental
                                causes of aggression. Although Great Britain had been the principal
                                champion of the League few British conservatives believed in it or
                                had a good word to say for it. Like Germany the British nation was
                                beginning to realize that there was no greater humiliation than that
                                of impotence and like Germany they now want to rearm as quickly as
                                possible in order to be prepared for the collapse of the League. Of
                                course, Hitler was not blind to the fact that British rearmament
                                might under given circumstances be aimed fully as much at Germany as
                                at Italy but the fact remained that Germany was in sympathy with the
                                present British policy of bigger armaments as a positive
                                contribution towards the maintenance of world peace.</p>
                            <p>In reply to my query whether Germany now expected to get her colonies
                                back, he said that the question of colonies was much exaggerated
                                both in Germany and abroad. There was a regular press campaign going
                                on in Germany for the recovery of colonies but it was important
                                chiefly as an indication that the German people were determined to
                                insist on being in no way inferior to other great powers. In other
                                words, they were far more interested in the legal right to possess
                                colonies or administer mandates if and when they wanted them than in
                                forcing the issue at the present time. Their self-respect will not
                                let them admit that they are less fit for colonial administration
                                    <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0236"/>than other nations. In
                                that respect Germany was in entire agreement with Italy and would—at
                                least in the abstract—support the justice of the latter’s claims to
                                colonies and expansion.</p>
                            <p>Otherwise there was really not much popular sympathy for Italy.
                                Mussolini’s diplomatic game was not quite clear but Germany suspects
                                that he has been using Hitler to bring political pressure to bear on
                                France and that the moment sanctions are lifted he will resume his
                                flirtations with France and perhaps even join a combination against
                                Germany. In any event Berlin expected no thanks for accidentally
                                helping Italy last March by moving into the Rhineland. The next step
                                would be the fortification of the Rhineland and it remained to be
                                seen whether France’s system of military alliances and regional
                                pacts would prove more successful than England’s scheme for
                                collective security.</p>

                            <p>263. A disorientation seems to have occurred in Latin-American
                                policies in Geneva.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine program during the past month has been forced to
                                undergo a series of modifications as a result of developments here.
                                A number of Latin-American Ministers called on me yesterday, among
                                them certain whose positions I described as supporting Argentina in
                                my No. 250 June 24 [<hi rend="italic">25</hi>], 8 p.m., and
                                recounting their difficulties in establishing an understanding in
                                their capitals of precise situations in Geneva state that it was now
                                impossible to say whether they could accord their support or not
                                inasmuch as what position Argentina itself would take now seemed to
                                be most uncertain. Admitting that their advices might be somewhat
                                inexact they said that they nevertheless understood that the
                                Argentine Senate in a recent private meeting had demonstrated a
                                desire that a strong pronouncement, if possible in the form of a
                                resolution, be obtained in Geneva on the principle of nonrecognition
                                and that as a consequence Saavedra Lamas who had let it be known
                                through his delegation here that Buenos Aires would be “satisfied”
                                by a less definitive support perhaps in the form of individual
                                speeches was now confronted by the dilemma either of receiving a
                                setback in his Government or being checked in Geneva. In any case
                                they did not believe that “strong” action could be obtained here and
                                that their present instructions did not suggest that they could
                                support anything of that type.</p>
                            <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0237"/>
                            <p>The Chilean Minister told me that respecting his initiative for
                                League reform, Chile had the support in varying degrees of Colombia,
                                Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. Stating candidly that both the
                                Argentine and Chilean actions here might in some respects be
                                regarded as an inopportune intervention in European affairs, the
                                reason he gave for Chile’s action was that a pronounced current of
                                opinion existed in Chile for separation from the League and that in
                                fact his Government might withdraw at any time. The Chilean
                                delegation here had however “persuaded” Santiago to give the League
                                “a last chance” to reform. It will be noted that the Chilean
                                statement before the Council (Consulate’s 259, June 26, midnight,
                                paragraph 4<note n="89" xml:id="d170fn89">Not printed. For Chilean
                                    statement made to the 92d Session of the Council, June 26, 1936,

                                    July 1936, p. 751.</note>) carried intimations in that sense. He
                                added that somewhat similar to the Chilean [apparent omission]
                                existed in the other states he had mentioned, notably he believed in
                                Colombia. He understood that Mexico was in a like situation
                                respecting the League but that the Mexican Minister here despite his
                                repeated solicitations had been unable to obtain instructions from
                                his Government on any points in the immediate Geneva issues.</p>

                            <p>264. In a private conversation with a member of the British
                                delegation concerning the bases of British policy vis-à-vis the
                                present Geneva issues, what he had to say tended strongly to
                                substantiate the opinion described in the latter portion of
                                paragraph 2, my telegram No. 246, June 24, 4 p.m., in other words
                                that any current negotiations between London and Rome did not go
                                beyond an effort to achieve an appeasement which was an end
                                apparently equally desired by both, that such arrangements as may
                                have been reached in this respect partake of the character of only a
                                limited <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, and that any
                                interpretation of immediate happenings in Geneva as having deeper
                                significance in respect of the great power-European situation should
                                be regarded with extreme reserve.</p>
                            <p>He stated that the chief present objective of British policy as far
                                as he perceived it was to recapture their freedom of action which
                                had been more or less accomplished by Eden’s speech.<note n="90"

                                as uncertain as heretofore and that in <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173"
                                    facs="0238"/>fact the entire British Foreign Office was aware
                                that the task of the Government following the meetings here would be
                                if possible to arrive at some precisions respecting fundamental
                                policy before September.</p>
                            <p>He further informed me that the British had reached what they
                                regarded as a satisfactory working agreement with the new French
                                Government which however did not thus far go beyond a general
                                understanding not to take individual action without prior
                                consultation. As characteristic of the general situation, the French
                                and British have agreed to limit the impending Assembly discussions
                                as much as possible and in particular to defer any decisions
                                regarding League reform until September being especially anxious
                                that the discussions here should avoid giving public opinion the
                                impression that the reform was moving in any specific direction. He
                                added that a potent element in the French–British <hi rend="italic"
                                    >rapprochement</hi> was an increasing anxiety in London
                                respecting Germany. The French have generally confirmed the
                                foregoing to me.</p>

                                information pending the release of the document:</p>
                            <p>After referring to the circumstances which preceded and determined
                                Italian action in Abyssinia and outlining as indicative of the
                                Italian attitude toward the League the various attempts to negotiate
                                a settlement which culminated in an effort on the part of Italy,
                                announced for the first time in this document, to establish at
                                Athens and Djibouti confidential contacts with the Ethiopian
                                Government 2 weeks before the flight of the Negus, the memorandum
                                describes the situation immediately following the collapse of the
                                Ethiopian Government which necessitated Italy to accept the
                                responsibilities resulting therefrom. <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174"
                                    facs="0239"/>It then describes the general conditions in
                                Ethiopia as well as the causes of the collapse of the former
                                Government and following an account of the subsequent acts of
                                cooperation with the Italian authorities of the religious and civil
                                chiefs and of submission on the part of military chiefs tending
                                towards resumption of normal life in the country, the memorandum
                                states that Italy has pledged herself to establish peace in Ethiopia
                                and promote the moral and material welfare of the country. The
                                memorandum then declares that Italy regards its work in Ethiopia as
                                a sacred mission of civilization and pledging itself to carry out
                                that work in accordance with the principles of the Covenant of the
                                League of Nations and of other international acts describing the
                                duties of a nation so pledged. To that end Italy promises the
                                equitable treatment of the native population with due rights of
                                representation, the respect of religious worship, the free use of
                                native languages, the suppression of slavery and forced labor, the
                                use of taxes for local requirements and accepts the principle that
                                natives should not be compelled to military service except for
                                police purposes and the defense of the territory. Italy also
                                guarantees freedom of transit and communication, the fair treatment
                                of the trade of all countries and agrees to keep the League informed
                                of the work in Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>The memorandum then states that Italy is ready to cooperate with the
                                League for a settlement of the problems on whose authority the
                                future of Europe and the world depends and states that it was in
                                that spirit that Italy joined the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro of
                                October 10, 1933.<note n="94" xml:id="d172fn94">See footnote 60,

                                that Italy is convinced that the reform of the League is required

                                that may be adopted to solve the problems relating to the future,
                                the communication concludes with the statement that the Italian
                                Government cannot but recall the abnormal situation in which Italy
                                has been placed and the necessity for the immediate removal of such
                                obstacles as have been and are in the way of the international
                                cooperation which Italy seeks and to which she is prepared to give a
                                tangible contribution.</p>

                            <p>267. Private diplomatic conversations during the last few days have
                                aimed at a reconciliation of positions to the immediate extent <pb

                                procedures may at least not expose sharp issues. These attempted
                                adjustments have notably existed between the European great powers
                                and Italy and Argentina.</p>
                            <p>A strong effort has been made by the British to prevent the Ethiopian
                                Emperor from following out his announced intention of participating
                                in the Assembly. I am informed privately that as apparently the only
                                means of accomplishing this, serious consideration was even for a
                                time given to declaring that the Ethiopian Government was
                                non-existent, that in view of the publicity given to Emperor’s
                                projected participation, repercussions in public opinion were
                                feared. The Italians have asserted that if the Emperor be allowed to
                                participate it will be a signal for an indeterminate delay in their
                                cooperation with the League and in European problems. The Ethiopian
                                delegation, however, is standing firm on an “everything to gain and
                                nothing to lose policy” generally described in my telegram 247, June
                                24, 5 p.m.</p>
                            <p>The British and French are tentatively suggesting in private a
                                postponement of the September Assembly until November. Members of
                                the delegations tell me that it is becoming increasingly irksome to
                                Paris and particularly to London to be “put on the spot” under a set
                                schedule to declare a policy when they have no policy to offer. The
                                British added that November is not a mystic date but that it would
                                at least be a deferment. Note in this connection my telegram No. 269

                            <p>1. Argentina has encountered increasing difficulties in prosecuting
                                its initiative here due to a progressive sharpening of the following

                                    >c</hi>) disapprobation of Latin American delegations based on
                                the foregoing coupled with what they regard <pb n="176"
                                    xml:id="pg_176" facs="0241"/>as an inconsistency between this
                                action and the general American attitude of resisting European
                                intervention in American affairs; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) desire
                                of Latin-American delegations to present common front in Geneva,
                                thus far resentment at Argentina’s seeking to play leading role and
                                hence a covert desire to see Argentina “taught a lesson”.</p>
                            <p>To a less extent the Chilean initiatives concerning abolition of
                                sanctions and Covenant revision have encountered similar
                                reactions.</p>
                            <p>2. The Argentine delegation has been feverishly active during the
                                last few days in exchanges by telephone with Buenos Aires and in
                                endeavoring to obtain support here. These efforts have included
                                earnest solicitation of support among Latin-Americans, virtual
                                “negotiations” with the Italians respecting the text of Argentine
                                pronouncement, a solicitation of support from European delegations
                                accompanied by more than a tacit threat that if Argentina is not
                                given satisfaction it will withdraw from the League.</p>
                            <p>In the last respect an American-European issue which I foreshadowed
                                in previous telegrams has become more pronounced. A number of
                                European delegations have asserted to me that if it came to a
                                show-down between European harmony and Latin-American sentiment they
                                preferred Latin-America out of the League.</p>
                            <p>3. The Argentine delegation informs me that its policy is to obtain a
                                strong reaffirmation of what they describe as “American principles”
                                respecting nonrecognition and territorial integrity which they state
                                are jointly expressed in article 10 of the Covenant and in the
                                Saavedra Lamas Pact, such a reaffirmation to be in the form of a
                                non-binding resolution containing no expressed application to
                                Abyssinia.</p>
                            <p>4. The foregoing is obviously a compromise position but I am given to
                                understand that it represents the lowest terms that Buenos Aires
                                will accept.</p>
                            <p>The Argentinians invited the Latin-American delegations in Geneva to
                                a conference last evening to expose their point of view as described
                                above at which were present the representatives of Bolivia, Chile,
                                Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Mexico and Venezuela.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine delegation informs me that this point of view was
                                unanimously accepted by the Latin-Americans here. They are
                                continuing this exposé with the Santo Dominican delegation which
                                arrived this morning and with others as they may arrive.</p>
                            <p>5. The accounts of the meeting given me by certain Latin-American
                                Ministers is however as follows. They somewhat sarcastically refer
                                to the term “unanimity” as meaning that Argentina had to retreat
                                toward their views. From the following description of positions
                                taken as related to that of Argentina they are inclined to feel that
                                it is not necessarily indicated that Argentina will be given
                                unanimous support on all points. Bolivia is in complete accord.
                                Mexico desires <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0242"/>to go much
                                further and would like a strong pronouncement with full implications
                                against Italy. Chile and Ecuador incline toward a “European
                                position”. Bolivia and Peru although favoring the nonrecognition
                                principle also lean toward Europe on the ground that “interests of
                                peace must be placed above principles”. The instructions of the
                                Panamanian and Cuban delegations are only to advocate the principle
                                of nonrecognition. The Venezuelan delegate is without instructions.
                                Thus much is seen to depend on exactly how Argentina poses the
                                question before the Assembly, this being yet not entirely clear.
                                While the foregoing presumably represents relatively true positions
                                the form of the statements undoubtedly also reflects a great deal of
                                irritation. I am thus inclined to believe that when it comes to the
                                taking of positions in public that the matter of nonrecognition may
                                progress fairly smoothly along some middle ground.</p>
                            <p>6. The Argentine Minister has informed me that he intends later to
                                take a position advocating “on juridical grounds” the lifting of
                                sanctions against Italy and that he understands that all
                                Latin-American delegations here will advance a similar attitude
                                except possibly the Colombian representative who states that his
                                present instructions are to favor a maintenance of sanctions, and
                                the Venezuelan representative who now expresses the intention to
                                abstain.</p>

                                had taken place between Italy and the League respecting Ethiopia
                                and, referring to the barbarous and disordered conditions of that
                                country, emphasized the spontaneous welcome accorded Italian
                                rule.</p>
                            <p>Certain assurances respecting the treatment of natives, the
                                prohibition of slavery, the militarization of the native population
                                and “fair treatment for the trade of all countries” were expressed,
                                as well as a readiness to inform the League of the progress
                                achieved.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, the statement reiterated Italian willingness to
                                cooperate with the League and recalled in this connection the spirit
                                in <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0243"/>which Italy joined the
                                Argentine anti-war pact. It was made clear, however, that such
                                cooperation is dependent upon the termination of sanctions.</p>

                                be harmonized with the manner of applying the Covenant, the American
                                republic would be obliged to reconsider the possibility of

                            <p>Panama advocated drastic revision of the Covenant based on regional
                                systems to be effected possibly by a conference of all League and
                                non-League powers. In somewhat general language held that the League
                                could not recognize the conquest of Ethiopia “without disowning its
                                own fundamental principles” but that the American states should
                                remain in Geneva as long as their presence did not appear in <pb

                                “certain well-known American principles of international law.” Did

                            <p>Blum, in discussing terms, emphasized the necessity for collective
                                security and disarmament and stated that France could not support
                                any reform measures which might reduce the League to the role of
                                “academic consultation.” His statement about recognition appeared
                                equivocal. Press carries full accounts.</p>

                            <p>276. 1. In the Assembly this afternoon:</p>
                            <p>Eden: The continuation of sanctions can serve no useful purpose; at
                                the same time “this Assembly should not in any way recognize Italy’s
                                conquest of Abyssinia” nor should there be any modification of the
                                condemnation of Italy’s action; his Government is prepared to stand
                                by the reciprocal assurances of mutual assistance given to certain
                                governments to cover the temporary period of uncertainty which might
                                ensue should existing sanctions be discontinued; attributed present
                                failure of League to the fact that nations are prepared to take
                                certain risks only where their own interests are directly at stake;
                                problem of reform should be dealt with by the September Assembly;
                                not necessarily rule of law but methods of enforcement should be
                                amended to correspond to action which nations are in fact willing to
                                take.</p>
                            <p>Canada: Held that economic pressure has been ineffective and that
                                sanctions should be terminated.</p>
                            <p>South Africa: In a blunt speech referred to the British and French
                                statements in the October Assembly, accused the great powers of
                                refusing to fulfill their obligations, asserted that the League
                                could not survive as an instrument of world peace unless sanctions
                                were maintained and questioned whether South Africa could continue
                                to collaborate with the great powers in the maintenance of
                                peace.</p>
                            <p>Litvinoff: Respecting Ethiopian question sanctions were ineffective;
                                respecting reform of League opposed scrapping articles 10 and 16 and
                                asserted that economic sanctions should remain obligatory for all
                                League members; the United States did not hamper the application of
                                article 16; recommended regional pacts of mutual assistance.</p>
                            <p>2. The following general attitudes, which obviously influence
                                decisions, are coming into evidence here respecting the Argentine
                                initiative and the policy of nonrecognition: (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >a</hi>) the implied threat of Argentina <pb n="180"
                                    xml:id="pg_180" facs="0245"/>to leave the League unless its
                                wishes be acceded to has made a notably bad impression among both
                                European and Latin American delegations; it is not felt to represent
                                true Argentine policy and is characterized as only a form of
                                blackmail; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) a number of delegates here,
                                aside from their desire not to take a position which would militate
                                against European appeasement, cite their experience with sanctions
                                as a reason for their opposition to any binding action in respect of
                                nonrecognition, being disinclined at present to join in a common
                                undertaking which might be broken by states for their individual
                                advantage.</p>

                                effectively occupied more than a half of their territory and that

                            <p>286. The Assembly this evening took up consideration of draft report
                                and recommendation submitted by the Bureau.<note n="4"

                            <p>The report submerges the Ethiopian draft resolution on nonrecognition
                                in the pertinent paragraph of the resolution.</p>
                            <p>The resolution notes “that various circumstances have prevented the
                                full application of the Covenant” but reaffirms attachment to the
                                principles of the Covenant “which are also expressed in other
                                diplomatic instruments such as the declaration of the American
                                States dated August 3, 1932, excluding the settlement of territorial
                                questions by force” (the quoted portion constitutes the final result
                                of the Argentine efforts).</p>
                            <p>The resolution invites the governments to communicate proposals for
                                improving the application of the Covenant for submission to the next
                                Assembly. It refers the matter of sanctions to the Coordination
                                Committee which “should make all necessary proposals to the
                                governments” in order to terminate them.</p>
                            <p>The Ethiopian delegate asserted that the Bureau’s drafts begged the
                                issues and insisted that the Assembly pronounce itself by roll call
                                vote on the two draft resolutions he had submitted (my 280, July 3,
                                10 a.m.).</p>
                            <p>The Panamanian delegate stated that he had not sent the Bureau’s
                                drafts to his Government because they were not worthy of it.</p>
                            <p>South Africa declared it could not associate itself in any manner
                                with the Bureau resolution.</p>
                            <p>The Bureau resolution was passed with South Africa, Chile, Panama and
                                Venezuela abstaining.</p>
                            <p>An attempt by the Ethiopian delegate to obtain a vote on their
                                nonrecognition resolution was quashed by parliamentary tactics. In
                                the negative vote on the Ethiopian financial assistance resolution
                                there were 25 abstentions which were evidently a protest against the
                                steamroller methods employed.</p>
                            <p>The date of the next Assembly was fixed for September 21.</p>

                            <p>287. The public utterances, private conversations and the atmosphere
                                of the meetings which have just concluded here reflected a greater
                                feeling of pessimism and defeatism than I have observed before in
                                Geneva.</p>
                            <p>1. Respecting the European situation, there were no evidences of a
                                cohesion of policy offering hope for an early settlement. Aside from
                                an obvious divergence of view the most marked characteristic was a
                                lack of incisiveness respecting any view. The atmosphere of the
                                situation is illustrated in that even in the cases when the
                                representatives of the great powers expressed themselves with more
                                positiveness, the reaction in the small delegations was that in view
                                of their experiences of the recent months what they desired was not
                                more words but deeds. The general picture is presented that the
                                trend of affairs will for a time at least be determined by some
                                action by Germany or Italy or by material happenings rather than
                                through the decisions of the Geneva powers.</p>
                            <p>To cite one example, the Greek and Yugoslav Ministers told me that in
                                respect of Eden’s statement concerning the Mediterranean mutual
                                assistance arrangements the British had not even mentioned the
                                matter to them here and they characterize his statement as merely
                                convenient phrasing. Furthermore, in a private meeting of the Balkan
                                and Little Ententes in Geneva it was decided that in view of the
                                “equivocal attitudes” of Great Britain and France their states would
                                not speak in the Assembly. It will be noted that this unprecedented
                                course was followed.</p>
                            <p>2. The question of the future of the League reflects the same
                                situation.</p>
                            <p>3. Respecting the Italo-Ethiopian question, the discarding of
                                sanctions was brought to the point of an accepted fact.</p>
                            <p>The technical position of Italy vis-à-vis the League as a state
                                “condemned” of aggression remains; it had been definitely planned
                                that the collateral question of nonrecognition implied in article 10
                                as applied to Abyssinia would not be presented. The Ethiopian
                                attempt to obtain a vote on the subject was unsuccessful. The
                                dispute as before the League has become lacking in substance and
                                completely formalistic. The only question on this latter score which
                                appears to remain is whether Rome may now demand juridical
                                concessions particularly <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0248"/>in
                                the face of the “recognition” of the Emperor by the Assembly and the
                                attendant incident precipitated by the Italian journalists.<note
                                    n="5" xml:id="d181fn5">The vociferous protest raised by the
                                    Italian journalists against the Emperor of Ethiopia which led to

                            <p>Respecting nonrecognition a member of the British delegation informed
                                me in confidence that while an attempt to “recognize” an Italian
                                Ethiopia was obviously an impossibility in this Assembly, British
                                policy, nevertheless, was to have this matter dropped as quietly as
                                possible or at most “vaguely” deferred until a <hi rend="italic">de
                                    facto</hi> situation in Abyssinia could merge into a <hi
                                    rend="italic">de jure</hi> situation. The Argentine initiative,
                                although every effort was made to keep it solely on the basis of
                                principle, rendered this difficult. A similar difficulty was
                                encountered when the Ethiopian delegation presented a juridically
                                “unassailable” case. Technically the question is now deferred to a
                                greater extent than was desired to the September Assembly. The
                                British feel that such a postponement is not necessarily a gain, but
                                perhaps renders the immediate as well as the future situation
                                respecting Italian cooperation more complicated; they believe that
                                the Italians will not be able to improve their situation in
                                Abyssinia during the rains and if the Emperor returns to Abyssinia
                                as he threatens it may even be increasingly awkward for the League
                                to “satisfy” Italy in September.</p>
                            <p>My informant added that he had reason to believe that Tokyo is
                                contemplating that immediately any one of certain governments

                                the recognition of Manchukuo.</p>
                            <p>4. Aside from the difficulty of discussing nonrecognition without any
                                inferences relating to Abyssinia the feeling respecting the
                                inappropriateness of the Argentine initiative was borne out by its
                                being completely ignored by many speakers.</p>
                            <p>The final action was the result of a hard fought compromise by which
                                the Argentine position was embedded in a general resolution which
                                was, however, materially less than the Argentinians had desired and
                                had expected to obtain.</p>
                            <p>5. The Latin American delegates have in the past fairly successfully
                                maintained a common front. The Argentine action, however, evoked
                                among them marked dissensions with consequent dissatisfaction. The
                                last minute rally to the support of Argentina in the Assembly on the
                                part of a number of Latin American delegations seemed from what was
                                said to me to partake more of the character of standing by a sister
                                American state in what had become something of an European-American
                                issue than of their approval of the Argentine action in Geneva.</p>
                            <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0249"/>
                            <p>It would seem probable that these developments will not be without
                                effect on general Latin American-League relations. It is felt in
                                particular that they may have a tendency to sharpen the issues, moot
                                in certain Latin American states, concerning continued support of
                                the League.</p>

                                the political adviser to the Emperor, called on me this morning and
                                in confidence related in substance the following.</p>
                            <p>It is very uncertain whether the Emperor will return to Ethiopia. He
                                described the Emperor as having now reconciled himself to the belief
                                that there is nothing further he can really accomplish.</p>
                            <p>Referring to an official communication of the Emperor to the
                                Secretary General naming the authorities with a seat in Goré upon
                                whom he had conferred powers to administer in his absence (official
                                address via the Ethiopian Legation at London) he stated, that their
                                best advices were that there were about 75,000 troops at Goré and a
                                total of about 135,000 loyal troops under command throughout the
                                Empire. The present authorities at Goré were not very aggressive but
                                should Makonnen who is a good soldier and administrator reach Goré
                                it would be a somewhat different story. The passage of Makonnen
                                through the Sudan had been taken up with the British Government
                                which stated that it would oppose no obstacles. The question of the
                                Emperor’s proceeding to Abyssinia had purposely not been taken up
                                with the British Government and should he go he would merely apply
                                for a visa. From intimations given the delegation by Eden he felt,
                                however, that the British would by some means prevent his return. He
                                did not believe that the resistance to the Italians would amount to
                                much inasmuch as, although mustard gas could not easily be used
                                during the rains, phosgene which the Italians also employ would be a
                                most effective weapon. He believed, nevertheless, that these forces
                                would be troublesome and expensive to the Italians for some time,
                                adding that at Goré they were plentifully supplied with funds. He
                                confirmed that the Emperor took little gold out of Abyssinia, his
                                present circumstances being indeed straitened.</p>
                            <p>He said he had reason to believe that without raising the question of
                                nonrecognition the status of Ethiopia vis-à-vis the League would be
                                    <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0250"/>settled at the
                                September Assembly by the Credentials Committee deciding that the
                                Ethiopian delegation’s credentials were not in order as not
                                emanating from a duly constituted government. He understands that
                                all Ethiopian diplomatic missions will shortly be closed which will,
                                he surmises, facilitate the problem respecting the foreign missions
                                at Addis Ababa.</p>

                            <p>291. 1. The Coordination Committee today adopted a resolution
                                proposing the abrogation by governments on July 15 of “the
                                restrictive measures taken by them in conformity with its proposals
                                1–A, 2, 2–A, 3, 4, and 4–B”.<note n="7" xml:id="d183fn7">For text,
                                    see League of Nations, <hi rend="italic">Official Journal</hi>,
                                    Special Supplement No. 149, p. 63.</note></p>
                            <p>It will be noted that the foregoing resolution makes no provision for
                                the termination of Coordination Committee proposal 5 dealing with
                                the organization of mutual support. While not mentioned by the
                                Committee, I learn on good authority that this course was followed
                                as a form of compliance with a demand of the neutral states for a
                                specific resolution binding members to mutual support in resisting
                                any Italian discrimination following the lifting of sanctions
                                (Consulate’s 253, June 26, 4 p.m., paragraph 1). The demand of these
                                states for fixed date in order that the lifting of sanctions might
                                be simultaneous was however fully accomplished.</p>
                            <p>2. A joint French and British resolution suggesting that governments
                                furnish the Secretariat before October 31 technical information
                                respecting their experience in applying sanctions and to appoint
                                experts to serve on a committee to study this documentation was also
                                    adopted.<note n="8" xml:id="d183fn8"><hi rend="italic"
                                        >Ibid.</hi></note> The motivation for such a resolution at
                                the time and the reason for the date chosen are not yet clear.</p>
                            <p>3. The Argentine delegate asserted that sanctions should be lifted
                                which were applied under article 16. There was, however, the
                                question of applying article 10 and it would be for the Council to
                                consider what should be done. He referred to the nonrecognition of
                                Manchukuo and expressing regret that the Assembly had not voted on
                                the Ethiopian resolution respecting nonrecognition indicated that
                                Argentina would have voted yes. He was strongly supported by
                                Bolivia. Haiti declared that they did not intend to recognize the
                                acquisition of territory by force. That the Argentine statement was
                                    <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0251"/>outside the competence
                                of the Committee and that the Assembly had already passed on the
                                question was stated by a number of speakers who at the same time
                                made it clear that in voting for raising sanctions they were not
                                taking any position on other questions.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine Minister tells me in confidence that he received
                                instructions to take this position only this morning. He added that
                                he personally found them exceedingly embarrassing. I gathered that
                                Buenos Aires had not been “satisfied” with the results obtained in
                                the Assembly and today’s action is generally considered here as
                                demonstrating Argentina’s defeat in the Assembly.</p>

                                These emphasize the perfect discipline of the Italian Navy during
                                the past year which made it possible to avoid war in Europe although

                                accompanied by this mutually gratifying recognition. All writers
                                express the hope that the British accords <pb n="187"

                                be no half-way solution and that Italy will not resume cooperation

                            <p>593. With regard to the report published in the press that the French
                                Government has notified the British Government that their
                                Mediterranean mutual assistance accord will not be in effect after
                                July 15th, the following are the facts as stated by the Foreign

                                instructed to say that the French were a bit puzzled over this since
                                it was their point of view so far as their arrangement with England
                                was concerned that once sanctions were lifted the mutual assistance
                                arrangement which had been based on the application of sanctions
                                must also cease to have effect. At that time the British Government
                                did not reply definitely to the French Government but said that the
                                Government must wait and see how public opinion in England
                                    developed.<note n="15" xml:id="d185fn15">On July 15, 1936, Mr.

                                well-informed confidential unofficial source I learn that the
                                Italian Government is undertaking to transfer from France, England,
                                Switzerland and other countries in Europe to the United States money
                                and securities which were appropriated by the Italian Government
                                from its citizens. I am informed a small part is also being sent to
                                the Argentine. The movement is alleged to be for the purpose of
                                removing the physical control of the securities from the
                                jurisdiction of sanctionist countries. Furthermore, there is no need
                                in those countries of balances for trade purposes which precludes
                                the idea of selling them there to establish credits.</p>
                            <p>As approximately 70 per cent of these securities owned abroad were
                                physically within the United States at the time of appropriation,
                                and I am recently informed that very few of these securities have
                                been liquidated, I invite your attention to the large increase in
                                the market <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0254"/>value of the
                                American securities listed on the New York Exchange. I still feel as
                                expressed in my telegram under reference that some attention should
                                be given to the possibility of their being dumped on the market in
                                case the market should break but not for retaliatory reasons. Some
                                months ago there was an alleged agreement between the Governments of
                                France and Italy to the end that Italy would not dump on the French
                                market French Government bonds but that liquidation if needed would
                                take place gradually so as not to disturb the market. We have not
                                been able to verify this agreement with France but we have sound
                                reason to believe it is correct. I call it to your attention for
                                possible guidance but I cannot recommend that we be supplicants to
                                that extent.</p>
                            <p>However, there is the real danger that the Italian Government would
                                attempt to dispose of its securities at the highest price obtainable
                                if the market gave the appearance of breaking. And in addition to
                                the potential danger which existed as of the time of my telegram
                                under reference which contemplated only 70 per cent of Italian
                                holdings abroad there is now the danger involved in the increased
                                amount which will run probably as high as 90 per cent in the United
                                States of securities held abroad by the Italian Government and all
                                valued at a higher level.</p>

                            <p>The British Ambassador called this morning and brought up the
                                question of the language of the resolution now pending in Congress
                                on neutrality with particular reference to section 5 of the
                                neutrality resolution of last August.<note n="20" xml:id="d187fn20"
                                    >August 31, 1935; 49 Stat. 1081.</note> That section 5 provides
                                for authorization by the President to prohibit the entrance of the
                                submarines of a foreign nation to enter American ports during any
                                war in which the United States is neutral. The Ambassador pointed
                                out that the proposed Administration measure, which was offered by
                                Senator Pittman<note n="21" xml:id="d187fn21">S. 3474, introduced

                                and House, respectively, as permanent legislation to take the place
                                of the neutrality resolution of last August, changed the reference
                                to submarines in this connection <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190"
                                    facs="0255"/>to submarines of belligerent nations. He asked,
                                therefore, whether the extension of the former neutrality resolution
                                as passed in the House yesterday made any provision for amending the
                                language of the August resolution in line with the change of wording
                                provided for in the Administration measures which have now been
                                temporarily laid aside. Upon looking into the matter, I found that
                                the extending measure, as passed in the House yesterday, did not
                                change the wording of article 5, which, therefore, is continued as
                                applying to all foreign submarines.</p>
                            <p>I then accompanied the Ambassador to Judge Moore’s<note n="23"
                                    xml:id="d187fn23">R. Walton Moore, Assistant Secretary of
                                    State.</note> office, as the Ambassador desired to know whether
                                there was any possibility of having this language amended by the
                                Senate before the final passage of the extending resolution. The
                                Ambassador explained that the adoption of a policy by this
                                Government prohibiting the entrance of submarines of a power not at
                                war might under certain circumstances be extremely inconvenient to a
                                large naval power and the fact that such a policy was adopted by an
                                important country like the United States might be a reason why it
                                would be adopted by smaller countries, thus causing unnecessary
                                difficulties for large navies.</p>
                            <p>Judge Moore explained that the application of this prohibition was
                                discretionary with the President and he pointed out, furthermore,
                                that as the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House
                                had mentioned in his report<note n="24" xml:id="d187fn24">H. Rept.
                                    2001 to accompany H. J. Res. 491.</note> on the bill passed
                                yesterday that bill would put into effect certain regulations with
                                regard to the entrance of submarines of belligerent nations into
                                American ports and that he had made a similar reference in a speech
                                before the House yesterday explaining the purport of the bill, which
                                speech is recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Congressional

                                the Government could at any time point to those two documentary
                                evidences of the intent of the Committee that this prohibition
                                should be applied only to submarines of belligerent nations and
                                that, furthermore, it was clearly evident that any action taken by
                                the President based upon the neutrality resolution would apply only
                                to belligerent nations.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador appeared to be perfectly satisfied with regard to the
                                intent and ultimate carrying out of this provision, but he said that
                                he would have been much happier to have seen a correction in the
                                language made which would have restricted by law its application to
                                belligerent nations.</p>

                            <p>141. There are certain preliminary problems of special interest to
                                our Government arising out of the situation created in Abyssinia
                                which the Department is no doubt considering and regarding which I
                                shall appreciate advice as soon as decisions may be reached.</p>
                            <p>The first of these problems in order would seem to be the question of
                                belligerency, namely, that a state of war between Ethiopia and Italy
                                proclaimed by the President in his proclamation of October 5, 1935,
                                is to be regarded as still existing. A formal declaration of war
                                between the two countries was never made and the war was carried on
                                with only the interruption of diplomatic relations other than upon
                                the entrance of the Italians into Addis Ababa Mussolini declared
                                that the war was over and that peace was restored. As a matter of
                                fact, however, although the usual military communiqués are no longer
                                published the newspapers announce further military advances on
                                Abyssinian territory and it is today reported that Harrar has been
                                taken. The question therefore arises as to whether a state of war
                                may be regarded as terminated merely by a declaration on the part of
                                only one of the belligerents that the war is over while military
                                measures which could scarcely be characterized as police measures
                                are still in operation.</p>
                            <p>Another phase of the same question relates to the present status of
                                the Ethiopian Government and the character which may be ascribed
                                thereto. According to the information available the Ethiopian
                                Government has entirely disappeared from the territory over which it
                                exercised sovereignty and there is no proof as yet of its
                                continuation elsewhere unless it may be regarded as established in
                                the person of the Negus. Judging from published expression, the
                                Italians are <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0259"/>contending
                                that with the flight of the Negus and the members of the Government,
                                Ethiopia as a state has ceased to exist. On the other hand a press
                                report circulated this morning states that France and England will
                                continue to recognize Ethiopia as a sovereign state. This phase of
                                the problem therefore resolves itself into the question as to
                                whether the Ethiopian State can be regarded as in existence and if
                                the Italian thesis is accepted as to whether a state of war can be
                                regarded as prevailing when one of two belligerents shall have
                                ceased to exist.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing observations are apart from the question as to the
                                attitude to be adopted in regard to the actual status of the
                                Abyssinian territory as a result of the Italian occupation. This
                                attitude will no doubt be determined in its general application on
                                considerations of principle involved in the Italian war of conquest
                                itself and in particular may be affected by the nature of the
                                juridical form which the Italian Government is expected to ascribe
                                by unilateral act to the conquered territory. Until this is
                                announced it would seem that no definite decision on the practical
                                aspects of the situation can be taken and it is possible that even
                                after this confirmation is made the special circumstances prevailing
                                in the conquered territory may obviate the necessity on the part of
                                the foreign governments of actually declaring their attitude toward
                                the status created. It seems clear, however, that the Italians once
                                having succeeded in justifying this war from their own standpoint,
                                will be astute to take advantage of any gesture in order to ascribe
                                to any foreign government acquiescence in that status and conversely
                                will be inclined to resent a manifestation of an unfavorable
                                attitude.</p>

                            <p>As regards the President’s Proclamation prohibiting shipments of arms
                                to both belligerents, we are of the opinion that our action must be
                                determined independently of the decisions of other countries and
                                upon the basis of the actual situation existing in Ethiopia. This
                                would involve such considerations as whether all effective
                                resistance to Italian forces has ceased and whether any executive
                                authority exists in Ethiopia other than that established by the Army
                                of Occupation.</p>
                            <p>We realize that the decision of states members of the League with
                                regard to the continuance of the measures which they have enforced
                                would presumably be taken in the light of their obligations under
                                the League Covenant and would entail consideration of the continued
                                existence of Ethiopia as a sovereign state. On the other hand, the
                                revocation of the President’s embargo Proclamation on the mere
                                recognition of the fact that the conditions which caused him to
                                issue it no longer exist would be based on the facts of the
                                situation and would have no relation whatever to the question of
                                recognition of rights to sovereignty over the territory.</p>

                                the war has definitely ended although the Italian Government is most
                                anxious to create that impression. By referring to my 339, May

                                        <ref target="#pg_76">p. 76</ref>.</note> the Department will
                                see that some of the Italian footholds in the north are by no means
                                secure and that penetration into the south is bound to be slow and
                                hazardous. Pacification of the whole country will therefore take
                                time.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand organized military opposition in any modern sense
                                of the term is not likely to develop on a large scale. Although
                                there are still a number of leaders in the field with guerilla
                                bands, it is impossible to estimate their strength. I understand
                                that the most important is Ras Imru with perhaps 10,000 men
                                operating in Gojjam.</p>
                            <p>May I suggest that the Department defer action until the situation
                                has become more clarified? It may also perhaps be advisable to
                                instruct London to make discreet inquiries.</p>

                            <p>In the light of developments of last week, and especially of
                                information given in telegrams from Engert and Kirk and Gilbert<note
                                    n="45" xml:id="d196fn45">Prentiss B. Gilbert, Consul at
                                    Geneva.</note> over the week-end, it is believed that this
                                Government should persevere in its attitude of “watchful waiting”
                                and should continue to take no action toward proclaiming, as for
                                this country, that the “state of war” between Italy and Ethiopia is
                                at an end.</p>
                            <p>Unquestionably the course pursued by this country, as indicated in
                                and followed under the so-called “neutrality” acts, has made more
                                difficult for the countries members of the League the effort which
                                they have made, under the Covenant, in their handling of the
                                Italy-Ethiopia question. The merits of our attitude and course of
                                action from point of view of interests other than those of this
                                country need not in this connection be discussed. The fact that a
                                number of countries are doing what they can to make the collective
                                system a reality and that this country does not see fit to
                                participate in that effort needs, however, always to be kept in
                                mind. Accepting the fact that we will not participate, there still
                                remains as a practical question for us this question: May not and
                                should not this Government be liberally and sympathetically disposed
                                toward the efforts of those who seek to make the collective system
                                effective to deal with the questions which are of more immediate and
                                direct concern to them than to us; should we not refrain wherever
                                possible from taking action not urgently needing to be taken by us,
                                which action, if taken, will make more difficult the efforts of the
                                others?</p>
                            <p>In considering the question of any proposal for action by us in
                                reference to the Ethiopia situation, ought we not ask ourselves both
                                of two questions, (1) what real advantage will that action, if
                                taken, be to us; and (2) will that action, if taken, be to the
                                advantage or to the disadvantage of efforts which are being made by

                                along with them a common interest (such as the problems of peace, of
                                respect for treaties, etc.)?</p>
                            <p>With regard to the question of our possibly proclaiming the “war” at
                                an end and lifting our embargoes,—would this action, if taken at
                                this moment, be of any real advantage to us? Is our trade or are our
                                interests in general with Italy and/or Ethiopia now suffering losses
                                or impairment because of continuance in existence of the embargoes?
                                    <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0263"/>Insofar as export trade
                                in arms is concerned, would our trade be measurably increased if the
                                embargo were lifted; and, are we eagerly solicitous for increase in
                                that trade? In the matter of travel, and in that of their business
                                and their relations in general with Italy, are our nationals now
                                suffering any substantial inconvenience or losses or hardship in
                                consequence of the continuance in existence of the embargo?</p>
                            <p>Would not any action in this connection by us at this time add to the
                                confusion which exists at Geneva and make more difficult the effort
                                which the British Government is making on behalf of the principle of
                                peace and toward preventing new eruptions in Europe?</p>
                            <p>Insofar as public opinion in this country is concerned, is there any
                                extensive or highly influential demand that the Government lift the
                                embargoes? Is there not a latent interest in the efforts of the
                                League and of the British Government, which, if action were taken by
                                this Government tending to contribute toward further frustration of
                                those efforts, would elicit an outburst of adverse criticism?</p>
                            <p>It is believed that it would be advisable for this Government to
                                continue to “proceed slowly” in regard to this whole question.</p>

                            <p>171. Department’s 43, May 16, 1 p.m. Although it is obviously
                                impossible to determine from information available here the actual
                                situation existing in Ethiopia, the following observations are
                                submitted as of possible relevancy in connection with the
                                Department’s study of the question of the continued application of
                                the President’s proclamations of October 5 on arms shipments and
                                travel on belligerent vessels.</p>
                            <p>As regards the military operations in Ethiopia it is possible only to
                                offer certain considerations which in themselves do not establish
                                the facts of the situation. The Italian Government declared on May 9
                                that the war with Ethiopia had ended and a Governor General Viceroy
                                was vested with full powers over the military authorities of the
                                territories subject to his jurisdiction. Since that date no military
                                communiqués have been issued and no important advances have been
                                reported since the fall of Harrar (see my 141, May 9, noon).
                                Accounts continue to be published of a gradual occupation of the
                                country accompanied by the submission of native chiefs, but all
                                military activities are referred to as dispersions of criminal bands
                                and police measures to restore and maintain order under a regime of
                                martial <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0264"/>law. No attacks on
                                Italian troops or effective resistance to Italian forces are
                                reported and in this connection Captain Meade,<note n="46"
                                    xml:id="d197fn46">Military Attaché at Addis Ababa.</note> who
                                has just passed through Rome en route to the United States, informs
                                me that although armed resistance on the part of native bands in the
                                unoccupied territory may be expected, there is no longer any
                                established Ethiopian military authority or centralized command in
                                the country. In view of the fact, however, that a large part of
                                Ethiopia is not under actual Italian control and that no definite
                                information is available as to the situation existing there both as
                                regards an executive authority as well as a military organization,
                                future developments in the territory outside Italian control can
                                only be a matter of conjecture.</p>
                            <p>As regards the status of Ethiopia with special reference to the
                                matter of the existence there of an executive authority, confusion
                                still exists but certain factors are apparent. Italy has declared
                                sovereignty over the territories and peoples of the Empire of
                                Ethiopia with the King of Italy as Emperor, a Governor General
                                Viceroy has been given power over the civil authorities of the
                                territories under his jurisdiction, steps are to be taken for the
                                organization of Ethiopia and the foregoing provisions are effective
                                as of May 9. Although no official statement has been made as to the
                                juridical status of Ethiopia as a result of the Italian victories
                                and the decrees of May 9 unofficial interpretations have
                                characterized this status as not in the nature of a personal union
                                of two crowns and two states and explain that whereas from an
                                international standpoint Ethiopia is an inseparable part of the
                                Italian state, from an internal viewpoint although it belongs to
                                Italy it is not incorporated in or annexed to the Kingdom. Special
                                measures have already been adopted for the administration of the
                                country and others are apparently in process of preparation.</p>
                            <p>In this connection civil governors (see my 133, May 6, 6 p.m.)<note
                                    n="47" xml:id="d197fn47"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref
                                        target="#pg_73">p. 73</ref>.</note> or commissioners have
                                been appointed for Addis Ababa, Harrar, Jijiga and Diredawa, various
                                other administrative measures have been announced (see my 161, May
                                15, 4 p.m., and 164, May 16, 11 a.m.<note n="48" xml:id="d197fn48"
                                    >Latter not printed.</note>) and within the last few days it has
                                been reported that the public works financing consortium has
                                allotted 100,000,000 lire to form the initial capital of a separate
                                section of that concern for financing public works in Ethiopia and
                                that the Committee of Ministers created last March for the defense
                                of savings has issued general instructions regarding the
                                organization of credits for the economic development of Ethiopia.
                                These provisions are predicated upon the Italian claim to
                                sovereignty over Ethiopia and are regarded as manifestations of the
                                application <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0265"/>of Italian
                                executive authority in the territory. On the other hand, it is
                                reported that the Negus maintains his sovereign powers and that
                                there is even a nucleus of a native government in the unoccupied
                                territory which might eventually exercise authority.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing observations are sufficient to demonstrate the
                                conflicting nature of the evidence relating to the military
                                resistance in Ethiopia and the existence of an executive authority
                                there and to indicate the impossibility of drawing definite
                                conclusions as to the actual facts of the situation.</p>
                            <p>From the evidence at hand, however, it might be argued that a war or
                                a state of war as typified by massed armed Ethiopian and Italian
                                forces in opposition does not exist at the moment and that from
                                present indications the renewal of hostilities of this nature does
                                not appear imminent. It might further be argued that not only is
                                there an expressed intent on the part of the Italian Government to
                                establish an executive authority in Abyssinia but that certain steps
                                affecting the occupied territory are being taken to carry out that
                                intent and that any attempts from without to modify that intent
                                would meet with an opposition from which the gravest consequences
                                might result. The validity of such arguments, however, and their
                                significance would be the basic factors in determining whether the
                                revocation of one or of both of the President’s proclamations of
                                October 5 would be warranted or opportune and, that fact should be
                                recognized by states whose decisions might be affected by other
                                considerations. Those states, either by direct negotiation or
                                through the mechanism of the League, are presumably occupied in
                                efforts to find a solution of the conflict whether by agreement on
                                some juridical formula or by absorbing the present conflict into
                                some general constructive plan of European reorganization. The first
                                problem of the United States, however, would seem to be the
                                liquidation of the measures adopted as a neutral during a war
                                whenever conditions warrant and the consideration of the final
                                settlement of the conflict and of the attitude of the Government
                                thereto may be left in abeyance until circumstances require a
                                decision in that regard.</p>

                                false. Reports add that the attitude of Ras Imru who, in command of
                                a few hundred warriors, had taken refuge near the Godjam border is
                                becoming less hostile. One editorial mentions Ras Imru as probably
                                the only chieftain alive who has not fled the country or submitted
                                to Italy and that his fate will soon be decided.</p>

                                states territorial occupation is going forward methodically with the
                                peaceful submission of the population. Absolute calm prevails in the
                                Gondar, Tana and Sudan frontier regions. The Third Army Corps is

                                political organization; the “October 28” Black Shirt Division
                                continues to garrison the Tembien. The air force maintains active
                                survey over entire territory.</p>

                                pertaining to civil and military measures in Ethiopia are taken from

                            <p>Marshal Badoglio has departed for Italy leaving Graziani in charge.
                                Graziani has been replaced as Governor of Somaliland by General <pb

                                of Somaliland has also been appointed. General Guzzoni, hitherto
                                Vice Governor of Eritrea, has been appointed Governor of the
                                territory comprising Eritrea, Tigrai, Danakil and Aussa. The Civil
                                Governor and Vice Governor of Addis Ababa have departed for
                                Italy.</p>
                            <p>Troops in Ethiopia will be kept at full strength, only volunteers who
                                hold political or syndical positions at home being furloughed.
                                Reports are published of the methodical occupation of the entire
                                country together with accounts of the advances made, accompanied by
                                submission of tribes, military leaders and former Government
                                officials. A high military official in Addis Ababa has denied any
                                skirmishes in localities occupied by Italian troops. A large number
                                of prisoners of war have been released. Fifty-three individuals are
                                officially announced as having been executed between the occupation
                                of Addis Ababa and May 21st, 39 of them having been caught in the
                                act of looting or firing, and all of them guilty of serious crimes.
                                An infantry battalion is being transported by air from Makalle to
                                Addis Ababa for experimental purposes. It is said that while all
                                undesirable foreigners will be expelled, persons engaging in honest
                                business will be protected.</p>
                            <p>A scheme for the administration of civil justice in Ethiopia has been
                                completed by the local government and is now in Rome for approval.
                                Fascist party headquarters for Addis Ababa have been established and
                                a Fascist Ethiopia youth movement organized. A commission of experts
                                is shortly to arrive in Addis Ababa to study questions connected
                                with the liquidation of the Bank of Ethiopia and the monetary
                                situation. A Rome–Addis Ababa civilian air line is expected to begin
                                operating in the middle of June probably via Khartoum. Airfields at
                                Diredawa and Debra Marcos are being rapidly improved and the Addis
                                Ababa field will be equipped to operate efficiently even at the
                                height of the rainy season. Civilian air lines connecting all
                                centers are now under study. Postal rates prevailing in Italy have
                                been officially extended to Ethiopia.</p>

                            <p>189. My 171, May 18, 4 p.m. Lieutenant Colonel del Valle, Assistant
                                Naval Attaché to this Embassy, has just returned from East Africa
                                and submits the following information based on his observations
                                there:</p>
                            <p>Colonel del Valle was with Graziani’s army from April 4 to May 15,
                                1936, and visited the following localities: Mogadiscio, Merca,
                                Obbia, Villa Gioabruzzi, Afgoi, Beletven, Gorrahei, Galredare,
                                Hamanlei, Sassbaneh, Jijiga, Harrar and Diredawa, proceeding by rail
                                to Djibouti from the latter place. At the time of his departure
                                effective opposition had ceased and the Italian forces were in
                                complete control of the areas visited. Bands of Ethiopian soldiery
                                were being gradually persuaded to turn in their arms; the Italians
                                pursuing a most conciliatory policy even paying for their arms and
                                arranging for their repatriation to their homes. General Graziani
                                was planning the occupation of the region south and southeast of
                                Addis Ababa by advancing from Neghelli along the main trail between
                                Magola and Addis Ababa. It is estimated that no opposition of a
                                serious nature will be encountered. Undoubtedly small armed bands
                                will continue to exercise brigandage in the more remote section for
                                some time to come but the suppression of these movements will be in
                                the nature of police measures.</p>
                            <p>While military commanders exercised supreme authority in the area
                                visited, civil officials were already beginning to function at the
                                time of Colonel del Valle’s departure and law and order were being
                                restored. Contact with the natives was almost entirely through the
                                civilian officials. People were returning to the towns and some
                                modicum of commerce was beginning.</p>
                            <p>Colonel del Valle is now preparing and will submit a complete
                                report.</p>

                            <p>266. Your 352, May 17, noon. The Department appreciates the
                                difficulties involved in your obtaining accurate detailed
                                information regarding the military situation, but it would
                                appreciate receiving from time to time such reports on current
                                developments as may help to throw light upon the subject discussed
                                in its 211, May 9, 4 p.m. Information as to extent to which Italian
                                control has been extended over Ethiopian territory would be
                                particularly helpful.</p>

                            <p>395. Department’s 266, June 4. There is really very little to add to
                                my telegrams in the latter part of May as the situation has remained
                                practically unchanged. But I should like to correct certain
                                erroneous statements in telegrams the Department has been good
                                enough to repeat to me.</p>

                                    is untrue that Italian airmen are maintaining surveillance

                                    southeast but no attempt at surveillance has so far been made in

                                    Italian forces cannot yet be said to be “in complete control”
                                    anywhere south of the ninth parallel and west of the fortieth
                                    meridian except along the railway. There seems to be no Italian
                                    troops south of the Blue Nile and the westernmost point in
                                    central Ethiopia so far occupied is Ambo about 55 miles from
                                    Addis Ababa. To say that contact with the inhabitants is
                                    maintained “almost entirely by civil officials” is entirely
                                    untrue even in Addis Ababa although it may be applicable to the

                                <item>Ras Seyum the Italians claim to have captured; also Dejazmatch
                                    Wandwossen, Ras Kassa’s eldest son. Ras Imru still has a force
                                    somewhere west of Ambo and Ras Desta is believed to be in
                                    Sidamo. In Lekempti, the province due west of Addis Ababa,
                                    Dejazmatch Gabre Mariam, a Galla who is the hereditary ruler
                                    there, has set up a government of his own and is reported to
                                    keep good order. Jimma, which like Lekempti is a Galla province,
                                    is being held by Kantiba Tanna an ex-mayor of Addis Ababa. He
                                    too is said to have the situation fairly well in hand. In

                                    former chief there, appears to have assumed control but with

                                <item>The Italians themselves admit that the disarming of the
                                    natives has been very slow and unsatisfactory. For example,
                                    Badoglio told me that in Addis Ababa only 400 rifles had been
                                    collected which is a ludicrous figure considering that nearly
                                    every Abyssinian habitually carried a rifle of some sort. In the
                                    provinces the proportion is doubtless even smaller and convoys
                                    between here and Dessie continue to be attacked.</item>

                                <item>The above is not intended to convey the impression that
                                    properly constituted political entities exist which govern
                                    portions of the country in the name of the Emperor or that any

                                    beginning for the Italians and that even if they are left in
                                    undisturbed possession by the other powers it may be 6 months or
                                    more before the whole country can be properly garrisoned.</item>

                                have generally appeared in the form of decrees and ordinances issued
                                by the Viceroy or Regent in Addis Ababa and it is assumed that that
                                procedure will be followed in the future. Furthermore, accounts of
                                any conflicts with Ethiopian bands or advances by Italian troops
                                into unoccupied territories have been totally absent from the press
                                and references to military activities have been confined to reports
                                of submissions and disarming of native chiefs, the existence of
                                banditry in certain districts and the surveillance by the air force

                                that the Italians have established an executive authority in
                                Ethiopia and that effective resistance to Italian forces no longer
                                exists, although it is obvious that further administrative acts will
                                be required to complete the establishment of this executive
                                authority and that further military measures will be required to
                                enforce and to extend that authority. Unless, however, entirely new
                                elements are injected into the situation it may be assumed that
                                future developments will be in the nature of a general process and
                                will not result in conditions analogous to those created by and
                                following the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. From the facts of the
                                situation, therefore, insofar as they may be determined from
                                information available and inferred from opinions expressed in
                                foreign circles, a state of war between Ethiopia and Italy may be
                                judged no longer to exist. On that assumption it is submitted that
                                the problem of the revocation of the President’s proclamation of
                                October 5th now becomes mainly a matter of policy which, in its
                                larger aspects, only the Department can determine. If, however, this
                                problem can be regarded solely in relation to its European aspects,
                                it is further submitted that the revocation of the proclamation of
                                the President would not only tend to eliminate one element in the
                                already overcomplicated situation but if carried out at this time
                                would further enforce the declared policy of the United States of
                                independent decision based on the recognition of facts.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: On May 9, 1936, we
                                instructed Mr. Engert, the Minister Resident at Addis Ababa, to give
                                us, after careful investigation, the benefit of his best judgment as
                                to whether it could be said that there was no longer any recognized
                                military opposition to the Italian forces in Ethiopia. It was
                                explained to Mr. Engert that this information was desired for use in
                                considering the possible revocation of the proclamation of October
                                5, 1935, placing an embargo on the shipment of arms, ammunition and
                                implements of war to Italy and Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>On May 17 Mr. Engert reported that it could hardly be said that the
                                war had definitely ended although the Italian Government was most
                                anxious to create such an impression. In this connection Mr. Engert
                                pointed out that some of the Italian footholds in the North were by
                                no means secure and that penetration of Italian troops into the
                                Southern area was bound to be hazardous and slow. On the other hand,
                                he expressed the opinion that organized military operation in the
                                modern sense was unlikely to develop on a large scale. At the same
                                time he pointed out that there were still a number of Ethiopian
                                leaders in the field with guerrilla bands but it was impossible to
                                estimate their strength. Under these circumstances Mr. Engert
                                suggested that action in the matter be deferred until the situation
                                had become more clarified.</p>
                            <p>On June 4, 1936, instructions were sent to Mr. Engert requesting such
                                further reports from time to time with respect to the military
                                situation as might help throw light upon the subject discussed
                                above. On the following day Mr. Engert replied that Italian forces
                                could not be said to be in complete control anywhere South of the
                                Ninth Parallel and West of the Fortieth Meridian except along the
                                Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway. He added that there appeared to be no
                                Italian troops South of the Blue Nile and that the Westernmost point
                                so far occupied in central Ethiopia was the town of Ambo, some
                                fifty-five miles West of Addis Ababa. Mr. Engert stated, moreover,
                                that the Italians had made no effort to penetrate into vast areas in
                                the Southwest of the country and that the Italian authorities had
                                been unable to accede to the request of the Belgian Minister for the
                                evacuation of eight Europeans located on coffee plantations only
                                fourteen miles [<hi rend="italic">hours</hi>] by road from one of
                                the railway stations not far from Addis Ababa. The Minister Resident
                                also stated that his repeated inquiries concerning the welfare of
                                American missionaries in the Southern and Southwestern part of the
                                country had always been met with the reply <pb n="209"
                                    xml:id="pg_209" facs="0274"/>that the Italian authorities had no
                                information concerning the situation in that area and that they were
                                not prepared to send any troops there.</p>
                            <p>From the foregoing description it would appear that the Italians are
                                not in control of the area marked in purple on the enclosed
                                    map.<note n="61" xml:id="d206fn61">Not attached to file
                                    copy.</note> It will be observed that this area amounts to
                                approximately one-third of the territory of Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Engert reports the receipt of information from some of the
                                Western provinces indicating that local chieftains have set up
                                governments in those areas and keeping reasonably good order.
                                Disarming of the natives has apparently been slow and
                                unsatisfactory. For example, Mr. Engert was informed by Marshal
                                Badoglio that only 400 rifles had been collected in Addis Ababa.
                                Inasmuch as nearly every Ethiopian was accustomed to carrying a
                                rifle of some sort the number collected at the capital is obviously
                                extremely small. The proportion of rifles collected in the provinces
                                is doubtless even smaller and reports are received that Italian
                                convoys between Addis Ababa and Dessye continue to be attacked.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Engert points out that he does not wish to convey the impression
                                that properly constituted political entities exist and govern
                                portions of the country in the name of the Emperor or that any large
                                organized forces are in the field even in those areas where no
                                Italian soldiers have so far penetrated. He observes, however, that
                                certain obvious difficulties are just beginning for the Italians and
                                that even if they are left by other Powers in undisturbed possession
                                it may be six months or more before they will be able properly to
                                garrison the whole country.</p>
                            <p>I learn informally that the War Department has no reports which throw
                                any additional light upon the military situation in Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>In view of the uncertainties of the situation and pending further
                                clarification thereof we are of the opinion that it would be
                                desirable to refrain from taking any action with respect to the
                                revocation of the proclamation of October 5, 1935, establishing an
                                embargo upon the shipments of arms to Italy and Ethiopia, until I
                                report to you further.</p>

                            <p>279. As was explained in the Department’s 211, May 9, 4 p.m.,
                                consideration is being given to the desirability of advising the
                                President to revoke the Proclamation of October 5, 1935.</p>

                            <p>From your telegram 395, June 5, 9 a.m., the Department understands
                                that you are of the opinion that despite occasional skirmishes
                                between Italian forces and Ethiopian bands it cannot be said that
                                the present military operations in Ethiopia constitute “war”. Before
                                taking definite action, however, with respect to the revocation of
                                the Proclamation of October 5 the Department would welcome as soon
                                as possible a further expression of your views and any recent
                                information which would throw light on the problem under
                                discussion.</p>

                            <p>428. Department’s 279, June 16. There has been no appreciable change
                                in the situation since my telegram No. 395, June 5. I am reliably
                                informed that 3 or 4 days ago an Italian convoy was attacked by a
                                large band of “Shiftas” <hi rend="italic">id est</hi>, ex-soldiers
                                and local inhabitants, some 80 miles from here on the road to Dessie
                                and that 3,000 Italian troops had to be detached from the local
                                garrison to ensure greater safety in that area. Skirmishes continued
                                to be [apparent omission] from the neighborhood of Addis Alam about
                                40 miles from the capital, and similar encounters must be quite
                                frequent all over northern Ethiopia although the Italian authorities
                                never admit any officially.</p>
                            <p>I estimate that over 40 per cent of the country is not even nominally
                                under Italian control and as the heavy rains are about to begin
                                military operations on a large scale and even air reconnaissance
                                would be suspended for about 4 months. In the meantime leaders like
                                Ras Imru and Ras Desta may be able to collect sufficiently large
                                forces to offer a certain amount of resistance when the Italians
                                attempt to occupy the southern and southwestern provinces.</p>
                            <p>Although the Italians in order to impress the natives announced that
                                an army of 30,000 had occupied Addis Ababa I feel convinced from
                                personal observation that only about half that number actually
                                arrived. Since then the garrison has been reduced to less than 8,000
                                men which has given rise to anxiety—privately admitted by Italian
                                officers—lest the rainy season find them ill-prepared not only to
                                insure communications but to defend the city itself. It is an
                                incontestable fact that even now columns of less than 1,000 Italians
                                dare not move outside a radius of 5 miles from the capital.</p>
                            <p>The military considerations [aside?] I venture to submit that the
                                revocation of the President’s proclamation of October 5 at the
                                present <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0276"/>moment would,
                                because of the peculiarly confused situation in Europe, assume a
                                very definite political and diplomatic significance which the
                                Department would presumably wish to avoid. The Italian Government
                                would at once seize upon it as an indication that America desires to
                                give a lead in an attack upon the sanctionist front. It might
                                therefore be preferable if we waited a reasonable time after the
                                next meeting of the Council of the League, even though its decision
                                would of course have no bearing on our policy, the revocation of the
                                proclamation would then be much less Republicanized and less likely
                                to be construed in a political sense.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, for purely practical reasons, it would be to our
                                advantage not to display undue haste. There are already many
                                indications that Italy proposes to deal with all foreign interests
                                in Ethiopia in a very high-handed manner and that the principle of
                                the open door will not be respected either as regards concessions or
                                ordinary trade. Without in any way connecting the two questions we
                                could, I believe, very properly evince concern regarding the future
                                treatment of American interests at the hands of the Italians before
                                taking a step which cannot but be exceedingly pleasing to the
                                Italian Government.</p>
                            <p>I realize fully, of course, that the abandonment of the arms embargo
                                would in no sense imply recognition of the Italian annexation of
                                Ethiopia but I felt I should point out certain psychological factors
                                which may indirectly have a considerable influence on utilitarian
                                bargaining as may later become necessary or possible.</p>

                                foreign States”, as specified in the resolution of Congress: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“… one speaks of guerilla war or petty war when, after the
                                        defeat and the capture of the main part of the enemy forces,
                                        the occupation of the enemy territory, and the downfall of
                                        the enemy Government, the routed remnants or the defeated
                                        army carry on the contention by mere guerilla tactics.
                                        Although hopeless of success in the end, such petty war can
                                        go on for a long time, thus preventing the establishment of
                                        a <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0277"/>state of peace,
                                        in spite of the fact that regular war is over and the task
                                        of the army of occupation is no longer regular warfare. Now,
                                        the question whether such guerilla war is real war in the
                                        strict sense of the term in International Law must, I think,
                                        be answered in the negative, for two reasons. First, there
                                        are no longer the forces of the two States in the field,
                                        because the defeated belligerent State has ceased to exist
                                        through the military occupation of its territory, the
                                        downfall of its established Government, the capture of the
                                        main part and the routing of the remnant of its forces. And,
                                        secondly, there is no longer in progress a contention
                                        between armed forces. For although the guerilla bands are
                                        still fighting when attacked, or when attacking small bodies
                                        of enemy soldiers, they try to avoid a pitched battle, and
                                        content themselves with constantly harassing the victorious
                                        army, destroying bridges and railways, cutting off
                                        communications and supplies, attacking convoys, and the
                                        like, always in the hope that some event may occur which
                                        will induce the victorious army to withdraw. If, then,
                                        guerilla war is not real war, it is obvious that in strict
                                        law the victor need no longer treat the guerilla bands as a
                                        belligerent Power, and their captured members as soldiers.

                            <p>I spoke with Ambassador Bingham by long distance telephone at 11:55
                                this morning regarding his telegram 384 of July 31, one p.m., to the
                                effect that the Emperor of Ethiopia contemplates applying to the
                                Ethiopian Consul General in New York for permission to visit the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>I told the Ambassador that you desired him to make every appropriate
                                effort to dissuade the Emperor from seeking permission to visit the
                                United States at this time. I suggested that the Ambassador might
                                bring discreetly and informally to the attention of the Emperor that
                                the interest of the people in this country is now wholly centered
                                upon the national elections next November and that a visit from the
                                Emperor meanwhile would almost certainly receive scant attention and
                                would be devoid of any results he might hope to attain through his
                                visit.</p>
                            <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0279"/>
                            <p>I suggested that the Ambassador avoid any discussion of the
                                advisability of the Emperor visiting the United States after the
                                elections and stated that you would prefer to meet that issue if and
                                when it arises at a subsequent time.</p>
                            <p>I told the Ambassador I was sure he would realize the necessity of
                                carefully avoiding any publicity in carrying out your instructions
                                in the present instance.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador stated that he understood the situation fully and that
                                he was sure he could carry out your wishes in this matter without
                                difficulty and without publicity.</p>

                            <p>389. Because of reports I have heard (my 384, July 31, 1 p.m.) and
                                especially in view of a telephone conversation with Murray, I saw
                                Dr. Martin,<note n="69" xml:id="d214fn69">Dr. W. C. Martin,
                                    Ethiopian Minister in the United Kingdom.</note> representative
                                of Ethiopia this morning, he having requested an appointment with
                                me. Dr. Martin referred to the fact that the Emperor Haile Selassie
                                had been urged to go to the United States for the purpose of raising
                                money to enable the Ethiopians to hold on to that part of their
                                territory still under their control. I told <pb n="215"
                                    xml:id="pg_215" facs="0280"/>him that I thought it would be
                                unwise to undertake such a visit at this time in view of our pending
                                presidential election when the minds of our people generally would
                                be fixed largely on their domestic political situation to the
                                exclusion of probable interest in outside affairs of any kind. He
                                accepted this statement apparently in full but then raised the
                                question of going there himself to which I made the same answer and
                                received the impression from him that he would not again attempt to

                                Martin cannot necessarily control the situation with respect to the
                                Emperor, I also received the impression from him that the question
                                of a visit by Haile Selassie will probably not be raised at least
                                for some time to come.</p>

                                reference primarily to trade promotion activities during the period
                                prior to the revocation of the President’s proclamations of October
                                5, 1935, and February 29, 1936. Inasmuch as the specific conditions
                                which caused the President to issue these proclamations have ceased
                                to exist it is no longer believed necessary to withhold customary
                                protection, unless it is clearly apparent that a request for
                                assistance is made in connection with a transaction made in
                                violation of the spirit of the proclamations and subsequent
                                statements of the President and the Secretary, which called for the
                                limitation of trade to its normal proportions. In such cases or in
                                cases where the transaction was solely intended to take advantage of
                                the abnormal conditions then prevailing, the Department considers
                                that assistance should be refused on the ground that such trade was
                                undertaken entirely at the risk of the shipper. Cases involving
                                doubt should be referred to the Department for its decision.</p>

                                p.m., Dr. Martin sent me the following letter.</p>

                                    you again, as on further consideration it has occurred to me
                                    that under our present critical position it will not only be
                                    unwise but dangerous for me to postpone my visit to America till
                                    November as very likely we will have been executed before then
                                    unless the necessary financial help is secured before long. I
                                    therefore think that I must go as soon as possible and take my
                                    chance of securing at least a certain amount of financial
                                    assistance.</p>

                                    to go as soon as possible.</p>

                            <p>I requested Dr. Martin to call at the Embassy and he came on August
                                8th when every effort was made to dissuade him from his purpose. He
                                politely insisted, however, that it was imperatively necessary from
                                the Abyssinian point of view for him to make the endeavor to solicit
                                financial aid in the United States which he believed “certain
                                sympathetic persons” would be willing to extend. He frankly admitted
                                that any funds so collected would be used to continue armed struggle
                                against Italy. Dr. Martin was finally told that the question was one
                                which would have to be submitted to my Government. Later in the day
                                he telephoned to say that he hoped when his request was put before
                                the Department that I would say that in the event he should be
                                unable to go himself the Emperor’s daughter would apply for
                                permission to go in his place.</p>

                            <p>333. The Reverend William Sheafe Chase, Superintendent of the
                                International Reform Federation, Washington, D. C, called yesterday
                                to inform the Department that his London representative had invited
                                the Emperor of Ethiopia to visit the United States presumably in
                                connection with Dr. Chase’s activities favoring the calling of a
                                conference of the signatories of the Paris Anti-War Pact to consider
                                the Ethiopian situation. He inquired whether it was true, as he had
                                been informed by his London office, that the Emperor had been
                                refused permission to visit the United States.</p>
                            <p>He was told that the Emperor had not applied for a visa and that
                                consequently permission had not been refused. At the same time Dr.
                                Chase’s attention was drawn to the considerations outlined in the
                                third sentence of your 389, August 5, 7 p.m., and paragraph 1 of the
                                Department’s 320, September 1, 5 p.m.</p>
                            <p>Today a letter was received from Dr. Chase stating that he had cabled
                                his London representative to inform the Emperor that “his papers
                                would be visaed by the American Embassy.”</p>
                            <p>The foregoing is for your information and in no way alters the
                                Department’s 320, September 1, 5 p.m.</p>

                                the London representative of the Reverend William Chase, <pb n="218"
                                    xml:id="pg_218" facs="0283"/>called to see me yesterday and
                                referred to the telegram he had received from Dr. Chase to the
                                effect that he might inform the Emperor that “his papers would be
                                visaed by the American Embassy”. Mr. Gaston seemed to think that
                                such a message was one on which the Embassy could act. I made it
                                clear to him, however, that the Embassy was in no way concerned in
                                such a message and that action in the premises could only be taken
                                under instructions from my Government. I endeavored to point out to
                                him the futility of the Emperor’s making a visit to the United
                                States, particularly before the election, and he gave me to
                                understand that the Emperor would not make such an attempt before
                                the election.</p>

                                of propaganda. He has sent me a list of persons and associations in

                                the trip. It appears that the director of the group is William Leo

                            <p>134. The statement by Mussolini last night that “Ethiopia is Italian”
                                has concentrated attention on the juridical procedure which the
                                Italian Government may eventually adopt in order to consolidate its
                                occupation of Abyssinian territory.</p>
                            <p>During the past few days of the advance on Addis Ababa various
                                conjectures along this line have been circulating. Prior to the
                                departure of the Negus and the disappearance of the Abyssinian
                                Government the solution generally predicted was the negotiation of a
                                peace with some Abyssinian authority which would give Italy
                                practical control of the country. Following the latest development,
                                however, the attitude has been reflected even in the press that
                                Ethiopia as a state has now ceased to exist; that therefore there
                                can be no negotiations and that Italy’s military occupation amounts
                                to political possession subject only to the specific appeasing of
                                other nations. On this assumption it has been suggested that the
                                flight of the Negus might be considered as tantamount to abdication
                                and that the organization of Abyssinia on the model of British India
                                might be contemplated with the King of Italy assuming the title of
                                Emperor of Abyssinia and the local government in the hands of the
                                various rases. Another procedure suggested has been that of actual
                                annexation with the colonies of Eritrea and Somaliland extended to
                                embrace the entire Ethiopian <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0285"
                                />territory. In some circles the Duce’s speech<note n="74"
                                    xml:id="d223fn74">Speech announcing the entry of Italian troops
                                    into Addis Ababa.</note> of last night is regarded on first
                                analysis as leaning toward this plan although his general reference
                                might cover other procedures. The suggestion has also been made that
                                Mussolini might propose the establishment of a system of government
                                similar to that maintained by the French in Morocco and in this
                                connection it might be recalled that in the initial stages of the
                                conflict the Duce drew an analogy between the Italian enterprise in
                                Abyssinia and the French occupation of Morocco.</p>
                            <p>The question immediately arises as to the relation to League action
                                of any plan that may be adopted. The theory has been advanced as the
                                League can only function at the request of a member state and as
                                Ethiopia is no longer a state the League can drop the matter without
                                any decision by the Council, Assembly or Secretariat.</p>
                            <p>This simple solution appears to be confined to Italian unofficial
                                circles.</p>
                            <p>The French Ambassador on the other hand told me yesterday morning
                                that he considered that a solution of the Abyssinian conflict from
                                the international standpoint was more difficult now than at any time
                                since the commencement of hostilities, that terms which might have
                                been agreed to in the latter part of last year, or even in March of
                                this year when direct negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia
                                failed, no longer seemed possible and that it was clear that Italian
                                aims had grown with the conquest of territory. The Ambassador said
                                that from the League standpoint a negotiated peace even with a
                                puppet native government in Abyssinia would be more acceptable but
                                there appeared now to be no material out of which such a government
                                could be formed. Any other plan would offer serious difficulties
                                although strenuous efforts were being made by France to aid in
                                arriving at some solution which would terminate the conflict.
                                According to the French view some form of cooperation between
                                England and Italy was essential to confront the problems of
                                reorganization in Europe and to that end France was urging
                                moderation on the part of the Duce and a more favorable attitude
                                toward Italy on the part of the British Government and it was hoped
                                that these efforts would result in some favorable results in Geneva.
                                The British Ambassador in a conversation today did not give the
                                impression that he considered that the events of the last few days
                                had in themselves rendered a solution appreciably more difficult. He
                                agreed that some form of negotiated peace would have rendered easier
                                the work of the League but that there now seemed no possibility of
                                such a development and said that some proposal whereby the welfare
                                of the native population might be safeguarded on the basis of the
                                principles laid down in article 22 of the Covenant <pb n="221"
                                    xml:id="pg_221" facs="0286"/>would go far toward relieving
                                British public opinion. British interests in Abyssinia, he added,
                                aside from the objection to the recruiting of a black Italian army
                                there, were confined to the Lake Tana region and certain grazing
                                rights and those interests were amply provided for in existing
                                treaties and agreements. As to the formula through which these
                                considerations would be given effect in Geneva, the British, as well
                                as the French Ambassador, offered no concrete suggestions and they
                                as well as others are inclined to the idea that events have moved
                                with such rapidity that the Italians themselves may not yet have
                                reached a concrete plan. It is felt, however, that some declaration
                                will have to be made by the Italian representatives in Geneva on May
                                11, and from certain indications it does not appear improbable that
                                a definition by the Italian Government of the juridical aspects of
                                the future status of Abyssinia might be forthcoming before that
                                date.</p>
                            <p>As regards possible developments relating to sanctions a thesis has
                                been advanced in Italian unofficial circles that on the assumption
                                that the measures were adopted by individual states on their own
                                responsibility each country may determine on its own initiative the
                                future of those measures and that consequently this particular
                                matter may be handled outside the League. The British Ambassador in
                                discussing this question said that it would be impossible to extend
                                the sanctions at Geneva as the French Government whose days were
                                numbered, could not go beyond the measures already taken, and the
                                British Ambassador likewise did not foresee any such move.</p>
                            <p>In conversations with members of the Foreign Office the usual reserve
                                is encountered as to the actual course of the Duce’s policy in the
                                near future. They reiterate the view that the war is over and that
                                the emphasis must now be on peace. Suvich<note n="75"
                                    xml:id="d223fn75">Fulvio Suvich, Italian Under Secretary of
                                    State for Foreign Affairs.</note> in a brief conversation today
                                reflected a certain optimism as regards future developments although
                                in answer minor officials showed that they were mindful of the
                                difficulties ahead. I detected a preoccupation among the latter as
                                to the attitude of France not only in connection with the policy of
                                the future government there but especially in regard to a possible
                                conflict of Italian and French interests in Abyssinia itself. This
                                preoccupation seems to be overshadowing in their minds the
                                Italo-British tension and to indicate a recrudescence of the
                                anti-French attitude which colored Italian-French relations before
                                the Laval<note n="76" xml:id="d223fn76">Pierre Laval, former French

                                an approach to the pro-British attitude adopted by the Italian
                                Government prior to the Abyssinian conflict. This possible change of
                                attitude, however, is detected only in limited official circles and
                                is not reflected in general public opinion here.</p>

                            <p>If Italy carries out to a logical conclusion the statement in
                                Mussolini’s speech of May 5 that “Ethiopia is Italian”, our first
                                question will be whether we should accept unqualifiedly the new
                                order of things and readjust our international relations
                                accordingly, or whether we should await the action of other
                                countries more directly and materially concerned. Unless the
                                Ethiopians under some new form of leadership shall continue the
                                struggle (which does not at the present moment seem likely), leaving
                                the possible eventual outcome in an unsettled state, we shall
                                probably be under the necessity of treating with Italy as the
                                sovereign power in Ethiopia. While it is not necessary to come to
                                any immediate decision on the course to be followed, we should be
                                prepared to act advisedly at any time that action seems to be
                                required.</p>
                            <p>It is more than likely that the first question requiring attention
                                will have to do with our diplomatic representation in Ethiopia. The
                                Italian Government will undoubtedly make a move sooner or later to
                                terminate the foreign missions in Addis Ababa.</p>

                            <p>If Italy actually takes over Ethiopia, I do not think that we could

                                jurisdiction in Ethiopia if the Italian Government objected, which
                                it undoubtedly will do.</p>
                            <p>In 1905, when Japan and Korea entered into an agreement by which
                                Japan was given control and direction of the external relations of
                                Korea, Japan undertook to see to the execution of the treaties
                                existing between Korea and other countries and Korea undertook not
                                    <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0288"/>to conclude any
                                additional treaties or agreements, except through the medium of the
                                Government of Japan. The agreement provided that Japan should be
                                represented at the court of the Emperor of Korea by a resident
                                general who should take charge of and direct matters relating to
                                diplomatic affairs. When that agreement was communicated to this
                                Government by the Japanese Legation at Washington, the Department in
                                a note of November 24, 1905, to the Japanese Minister, stated that
                                it had on that day directed by telegraph the withdrawal of the
                                American Mission to Korea, and had given instructions that the
                                representation of the United States in diplomatic matters and
                                relations with Korea would thereafter be conducted directly with the
                                Japanese Legation at Washington, or through the American Legation at
                                Tokyo. (1905 <hi rend="italic">For. Rel</hi>. pp. 612–614).</p>
                            <p>Later, on August 22, 1910, Japan and Korea concluded a treaty by
                                which the Emperor of Korea ceded all rights of sovereignty over the
                                whole of Korea to Japan. At the time this treaty was concluded,
                                Japan made a declaration with reference to matters relating to
                                foreigners and foreign trade in Korea. Among other things the
                                declaration stated that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Treaties hitherto concluded by Korea with foreign powers
                                        ceasing to be operative, Japan’s existing treaties will, so
                                        far as practicable, be applied to Korea. Foreigners resident
                                        in Korea will, so far as conditions permit, enjoy the same

                                At the same time assurances were given by France that the

                                formal annexation of the Island as a French colony, the treaties

                            <p>Other instances could be cited, but these will suffice to show that,
                                generally speaking, when a country is absorbed by another country,
                                whether by treaty or by force of arms, treaties between the annexed
                                country and third powers cease to exist, and the territory of the

                                has been established by Italian authorities, and that Legation
                                officials will be allowed, “pending further disposition regarding

                                but a temporary measure and may be changed at any time. A military
                                occupant, especially one who has conquered and subjugated a country,
                                has supreme power over the territory occupied, and, to all intents
                                and purposes, is the sovereign during the period of occupation. The
                                belligerent military occupant, for example, possesses an
                                unquestioned right to regulate all intercourse between the territory
                                under his control and the outside world. The situation in Ethiopia
                                is different in some respects from that obtaining in Belgium during
                                the World War. In that case Germany was in the position <pb n="225"
                                    xml:id="pg_225" facs="0290"/>of a military invader, as
                                distinguished from a conqueror, as is the case of Italy in Ethiopia,
                                yet, in the case of Belgium, the German Government announced in
                                November, 1914, that exequaturs of neutral consular officers in
                                Belgium would be regarded as having expired. Minister Whitlock,
                                however, remained in Brussels and continued to enjoy diplomatic
                                privileges and immunities until the severance of diplomatic
                                relations between the United States and Germany (February 3, 1917)
                                when the German authorities withdrew his diplomatic privileges.
                                Nevertheless, Mr. Whitlock remained in Brussels until the end of
                                March 1917, when he and other American officials in Belgium were
                                ordered by this Government to withdraw.</p>
                            <p>For the time being action by this Government should await further
                                announcements on the part of Italy.</p>

                                come up for decision possibly within three or four days hence. In
                                the most unofficial and individual manner, I suggested that it would
                                be exceedingly important if the Ambassador could, in the same
                                informal way, sound out his Government as to what it had in mind
                                with respect to the interpretation and application of the Argentine
                                Peace Pact to the forcible invasion and seizure of Ethiopia by
                                Italy.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador said that the Italian situation in his country, to
                                which this question would call attention, would be most serious;
                                that there were one million native-born Italians in Argentina and
                                they were a great factor in that country. I reminded him that of
                                course we had a similar situation in this country, but said that
                                great peace champions like our two nations and our two governments,
                                who are accustomed to proclaim the sanctity of treaties and to
                                denounce violaters of treaties, are in no situation to turn and walk
                                away from <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0291"/>the plain letter,
                                as well as the spirit and policy, of the peace obligation to which
                                they are signatories without saying or doing anything; and that it
                                is correspondingly important that the Argentine Government—the
                                author of this peace pact, its sponsor and its depository—may
                                undoubtedly have something special or definite in mind as to how to
                                deal with the forthcoming Italo-Ethiopian situation as applied from
                                the standpoint of a signatory of the Argentine Peace Pact.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador again expressed himself as feeling that the matter
                                would be quite difficult. He finally stated, however, that he would
                                immediately think over all its phases and see what he could do in
                                this respect and advise me later.</p>

                            <p>144. Foreign Office telephoned me yesterday afternoon that if I
                                wished to view the ceremony at the Palazzo Venezia in the evening a
                                window would be reserved in the Palace. The same invitation was
                                extended to all chiefs of mission of non-sanctionist countries and
                                War Ministry invited corresponding Military, Naval and Air Attachés
                                and certain foreign military missions in Rome to attend and as I
                                considered it advisable for me to be at the chancery while the
                                announcements were being made I inquired at the Foreign Office as to
                                the nature of the invitation and upon being informed that it was not
                                official I explained the circumstances that might prevent me from
                                attending and I was not present at the ceremony announcing the
                                Empire. The Military and Naval Attachés to the Embassy were at the
                                Palazzo Venezia.</p>
                            <p>As the Italian press publishes prominently today a list of the chiefs
                                of mission attending the ceremony and the fact that they were
                                received by Mussolini afterwards I am sending the foregoing for the
                                Department’s information.</p>

                            <p>147. Insofar as can be ascertained at present the status of Ethiopia
                                which the Italian Government regards as having been established by
                                the decree approved Saturday night (my 143, May 9, midnight<note
                                    n="88" xml:id="d228fn88">Not printed.</note>) is not clearly
                                defined even in the minds of Italian officials themselves. They
                                declare that from their point of view the Empire of Ethiopia has
                                ceased to exist and that the territories and peoples of the Empire
                                have been placed under Italian sovereignty and in this connection
                                the doctrine of “debellatio” is mentioned. It is on the matter of
                                the juridical status of the territory, however, and the significance
                                thereof where uncertainty seems to exist. It is pointed out that
                                this is not a clear case of annexation nor has a colony been formed
                                but an entity has been set up of which the exact nature and relation
                                to the Kingdom of Italy will have to be defined by subsequent
                                administration acts. The analogy of Great Britain and India is
                                alluded to and in certain <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0293"
                                />unofficial circles reference is made as to the possibility of
                                invoking the analogy in order to facilitate League action. More
                                definite explanations are not yet available.</p>
                            <p>In the course of a conversation at the Foreign Office I was informed
                                of the telegram sent to Italian missions abroad instructing that the
                                respective governments be handed copies of the Royal Decree approved
                                May 9th with certain oral explanations. I gathered that, contrary to
                                the conjectures circulating in diplomatic circles, there is no
                                thought of attempting to obtain any “recognition” on the part of
                                foreign states of the situation created, but a responsible official
                                of the Ministry volunteered the statement that it was hoped that
                                “friendly governments would take cognizance of the situation”
                                described in the Royal Decree. Whether, however, foreign governments
                                may be confronted with some special circumstance involving a
                                decision as to the recognition of the title of Emperor conferred on
                                the King of Italy has apparently been given little thought as yet at
                                the Ministry.</p>
                            <p>Suvich this morning told me that from their reports the reactions in
                                England and France were not very gratifying. He expressed great
                                interest in the views that might be expressed in the United States
                                and spoke with enthusiasm of the recent statement<note n="89"
                                    xml:id="d228fn89">See despatch No. 1685, May 15, from The Chargé

                                Ambassador Long which has been published here. Mussolini also, at
                                the Palazzo Venezia on Saturday evening, conveyed to the Military
                                Attaché to this Embassy his appreciation of the Ambassador’s
                                statement and I have learned that he thanked the representatives of
                                non-sanctionist governments whom he received on that occasion (see
                                my 144, May 10, 10 a.m.) for the attitude of their governments
                                during the conflict.</p>
                            <p>In general the members of the Italian Government and the people are
                                at present outspoken in protestations of friendship for the United
                                States and are eagerly awaiting some indication of America’s
                                attitude. They naturally hope that this attitude will be favorable.
                                The neutral policy of the United States Government is commended
                                editorially and appreciated in Italy and there is the further hope
                                here that the development of that policy in the face of recent
                                events will not render more difficult the efforts towards the
                                settlement of a conflict which, irrespective of considerations of
                                justice in the cause itself, Italy is now attempting to regularize
                                and eliminate as a menace to world peace. I am convinced, however,
                                that whenever it may be found necessary or advisable for the United
                                States to disclose an attitude, and whatever that attitude may be or
                                whether it is openly expressed or conveyed by implication, it cannot
                                but be recognized here that the Government of the United States in
                                reaching its decisions is adopting its own independent course of
                                action irrespective of the policies of other governments.</p>

                            <p>The Italian Ambassador called on his own initiative and stated that
                                his Government had instructed him to notify me in accordance with a
                                memorandum, quoted below,<note n="91" xml:id="d230fn91">Memorandum
                                    dated May 11, 1936, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> which
                                the Ambassador then proceeded to hand to me.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador said that his Government had further instructed him to
                                make certain oral explanations relative to the speedy and, what I
                                inferred from the language of the Ambassador to be, the premature
                                action of the Italian Government in proclaiming the annexation of
                                Ethiopia with the Italian King as Emperor of that country. The idea
                                he sought to convey was that a state of more or less anarchy and
                                looting, with killing and injuring of people, had been existing in
                                Ethiopia after the departure of the Ethiopian Government and before
                                the arrival of Italian troops in Addis Ababa and certain other
                                centers of population. There was not much substance to his
                                explanation. He branched off a little further in this general
                                direction, but in a broader <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0295"
                                />way, with some comment relative to the manner in which Italy at
                                this stage is misunderstood both at Geneva and elsewhere in the
                                world; and that in due course the motives of Italy and the many
                                special circumstances which are not generally understood and known
                                at present will become known to other nations and Italy then will
                                not be subjected to the same viewpoint by others that she now is to
                                a more or less extent.</p>
                            <p>I simply thanked the Ambassador when he handed me the written
                                memorandum and also when he concluded his somewhat rambling and
                                scattering oral statement.</p>
                            <p>He then remarked that his Government realized it was too early for
                                consideration to be given to these matters by us or others; that he
                                understood perfectly that I was not expected to offer any comment at
                                this stage. I again thanked him for what he was saying and indicated
                                that I understood perfectly the idea he was expressing—the fact that
                                no comment was expected at this time.</p>

                            <p>The Italian Ambassador told me that he had just left with the
                                Secretary, under instructions, formal notification of the annexation
                                of Ethiopia; that he had asked for no comments and that the
                                Secretary had made none; he went on to say that the annexation was
                                by far the best solution of the problem; that he felt, in due
                                course, Geneva would recognize the facts as they existed; the
                                Italian Government had been very much surprised as [<hi
                                    rend="italic">at</hi>] the degree of pacification which had
                                already been accomplished in Ethiopia; there had been stouter
                                resistance expected from the local tribes; the subservient tribes,
                                which occupied an inferior position to the “Ethiopian war lords”
                                had, in fact, all of them accepted the Italian administration of the
                                country; 200,000 of the Italian army had already agreed to remain in
                                the country and cultivate the land in the vicinity of Aduwa and more
                                undoubtedly would follow their lead.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador asked me what position the United States would take in
                                the circumstances and he proceeded to give his own ideas as to what
                                this attitude would be; that the United States, not being one of the
                                powers more immediately concerned in that part of the world, would
                                await the action of the more interested governments before reaching
                                any conclusion, etc. etc.</p>
                            <p>I said that, in my opinion, we were not ready even to go as far as
                                this; that, in fact, we had not yet decided what course we were
                                ready to <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0296"/>pursue; that the
                                situation was still, as far as we were concerned, in a state of flux
                                and that this Government had not determined the course which we
                                would adopt.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador concluded his remarks by a reference to the
                                adjournment at Geneva and the fact that the next regular meeting of
                                the League Council would be in January [<hi rend="italic"
                                >June?</hi>] when he assumed that the attitude of the nations with
                                respect to Abyssinia would again be the subject of discussion.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Yoshizawa read aloud in translation a telegram which, he said,
                                had been received this morning by the Japanese Embassy from the
                                Foreign Office at Tokyo. The telegram read substantially as follows:
                                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The Italian Ambassador called on the Vice Minister for
                                        Foreign Affairs and read to him the recent Italian decree
                                        extending Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia. The Italian
                                        Ambassador then observed that he assumed that the Japanese
                                        Government recognized the sovereignty of Italy over
                                        Ethiopia. The Vice Minister replied that the matter would be
                                        taken under advisement by the Japanese Government.</p>
                                    <p>The Embassy is directed to inquire as soon as practicable at
                                        the Department of State in regard to the attitude in the
                                        premises of the American Government, and to expedite its
                                        reply.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Yoshizawa asked Mr. Dooman whom he could call upon to make the
                                inquiry which the Embassy had been directed by the Japanese
                                Government to make. Mr. Dooman replied that, so far as he knew, no
                                decision in the matter had been taken by the American Government,
                                but that he was not at all conversant with the details. He said to
                                Mr. Yoshizawa that he would endeavor to ascertain the officer in the
                                Department upon whom Mr. Yoshizawa could most appropriately call in
                                connection with the situation in Ethiopia. Mr. Yoshizawa called
                                attention to the urgency of the matter and expressed the hope that
                                Mr. Dooman would communicate with him in sufficient time for Mr.
                                Yoshizawa to call at the Department again during the course of the
                                day. Mr. Dooman stated that he would endeavor to reply as soon as
                                possible.</p>
                            <p>As Mr. Yoshizawa rose to leave, he said with a smile that he assumed

                            <p>The Chinese Ambassador called, under instructions, to inquire what
                                action this Government proposed to take in reply to the Italian
                                notification of the annexation of Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador admitted that the interest of his Government was
                                somewhat academic because of the fact that China had no material
                                interest in Ethiopia; nevertheless, his Government was anxious to
                                ascertain the views of the United States.</p>
                            <p>I replied that we had not, as yet, reached any decision with respect
                                to this matter; we were still studying all the aspects of it, in
                                Ethiopia itself, as well as the attitudes of other governments which
                                have more immediate responsibilities in that part of the world; the
                                situation was, as he would understand, still in a state of flux; we
                                did not feel that any particular haste was required with regard to
                                our action and that, therefore, we were proceeding to gather
                                together all the information available on the entire subject.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington</hi>, May 8th p.m.—The American
                                    Ambassador to Rome, Long, has granted an interview to the
                                    Universal Service in which he said he was convinced of the rapid
                                    and complete pacification of Ethiopia by Italian soldiers and
                                    colonists.</p>
                                <p>After affirming that the fertile soil of the Ethiopian highlands
                                    would give Italy valuable crops, Long said that his three years
                                    in Rome had convinced him that Italy had absolute need of
                                    colonies.</p>
                                <p>As to Italo-American relations, Long said: “The longstanding
                                    friendship between the two countries has been cemented by
                                    American neutrality in the Ethiopian affair. Italian cordiality
                                    toward the United States is not merely the expression of
                                    official circles but is also a matter of feeling.”</p>

                                        >Echo</hi> publishes an interview granted to its American
                                    correspondent by the American Ambassador to Rome, Breckinridge
                                    Long, at present in the United States.</p>
                                <p>The Ambassador expressed himself in terms of the highest
                                    recognition for the courage demonstrated by the Italian people
                                    toward the war and sanctions.</p>
                                <p>“Life in Italy,” he said, “has changed much less than people
                                    insist on believing in various places abroad. The spirit of the
                                    country has not been shaken in the slightest. Even Mussolini
                                    personally has <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0301"/>never
                                    been in the least affected by the tension of the international
                                    situation. Mussolini never doubted that he would issue forth
                                    victorious, and he has won all along the line.</p>
                                <p>“Not only is the campaign in Abyssinia virtually over, but the
                                    diplomatic struggle at Geneva is decided. Fascism has enforced
                                    its will. There are no factors of any kind that can break that
                                    will. This victory has the value of a new guarantee for peace in
                                    Europe.</p>
                                <p>“Four months ago it indeed seemed that there were dangers of war
                                    everywhere. Now, however, the situation is cleared up and a
                                    relaxation of tension has therefore taken place. In my opinion
                                    there can no longer be any immediate possibility of war now that
                                    Italy can devote her full attention to the European
                                    situation.”</p>
                                <p>The Ambassador said that there could be no doubt as to Italian
                                    sympathies for Austria, and the correspondent further receives
                                    from the conversation the impression that even American
                                    diplomacy is in a position to appreciate the importance of the
                                    problem of Austrian independence.</p>

                            <p>The Counselor of the Italian Embassy came in this morning and said
                                that he had been sent by the Ambassador to talk to me in a very
                                frank and confidential manner about the situation in connection with
                                the Italian occupation of Ethiopia and the decree of May 9
                                proclaiming the annexation of Ethiopia. He said that he would take
                                the liberty of discussing the matter with me, although he realized
                                that it might be difficult or even impossible for me to answer some
                                of the questions he might put to me. He said he would understand
                                perfectly if I were not able to answer him on any of the points he
                                brought up.</p>
                            <p>He said that the Italian Government had received from the Canadian
                                Government a simple acknowledgment of the Italian communication of
                                the decree of May 9 and that the reply of the Argentine <pb n="237"
                                    xml:id="pg_237" facs="0302"/>Government to this communication
                                was in the form of an acknowledgment and a statement that the
                                Argentine Government made a reservation with respect to the attitude
                                it would adopt toward the annexation of Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>Rossi Longhi went on to say that the Italian Government had heard
                                that the Government of Colombia had suggested to the American
                                governments, including the United States, that all the American
                                governments inform the Italian Government in reply to its
                                notification of the decree of May 9th that in conformity with
                                Article 2 of the Anti-War Treaty of October, 1933, the American
                                governments would not recognize the taking over of Ethiopia by
                                Italy. He said the Italian Government had also been informed that
                                the Governments of Brazil and Peru had indicated to the Colombian
                                Government that they were not prepared to take action along the
                                lines suggested by Colombia and that the reply of the Government of
                                Guatemala to the Government of Colombia, while indicating a
                                disinclination to accede to the Colombian suggestion, was a rather
                                more lengthy reply than those of Peru and Brazil.</p>
                            <p>The Counselor then asked me whether I could give him any information
                                as to what the attitude of this Government would be toward the
                                suggestion of the Colombian Government. I said that I was not
                                prepared to give him any information with regard to the American
                                attitude toward the recent developments in Ethiopia. I said that we
                                had received inquiries from other governments as to what the
                                attitude of this Government would be toward the situation and that
                                in response to such inquiries we had stated that we were not
                                prepared to give any expression of our views at this time; that we
                                were receiving information continually and observing all the
                                developments in connection with the situation, but that we were not
                                in any position to give any expression whatever on the subject.</p>
                            <p>Rossi Longhi asked if that had been our reply to the Colombian
                                Government. I said that our replies to any inquiries on the subject
                                were uniformly in the sense as I had given it above.</p>
                            <p>The Counselor then asked if I could tell him anything about the
                                Presidential Proclamation<note n="95" xml:id="d241fn95">See <ref
                                        target="#pg_192">pp. 192</ref> ff.</note> and smilingly
                                remarked that “the war is over.” I told him I had nothing whatever
                                to say on that subject. He then went on to say that the Italian
                                Government felt that the situation as far as concerned the positions
                                of the various European governments and their attitudes toward Italy
                                had not become less favorable since the last meeting of the League
                                Council, though it might not be correct to say that their attitudes
                                were more favorable. The Italian Government hoped, however, that
                                with the passing of a few weeks before the next meeting of the
                                Council on June 16th the attitude of the <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238"
                                    facs="0303"/>sanctionist Powers might improve and the Government
                                felt that any action taken by the American States along the lines
                                suggested by Colombia would only make the situation more difficult
                                with particular regard to the effect that such action might have on
                                the question of sanctions. I gathered that the Italian Government
                                was most anxious that no action unfavorable to the Italian thesis be
                                taken by the American States which might have a detrimental
                                influence on its cause at Geneva.</p>
                            <p>Rossi Longhi, before leaving, suggested that he might come in from
                                time to time to discuss these matters with me and asked me if I
                                would be willing to allow him to keep in touch with me in that way
                                in a frank and confidential discussion of this situation as it
                                develops. I told him that I would be very glad to see him at any
                                time and to have any information he might wish to give us.</p>

                            <p>72. Your 128, May 21, 11 a.m. This Government has received a note in
                                the same sense from the Italian Government but has refrained from
                                making any reply for the time being.</p>
                            <p>Please inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that I appreciate his
                                friendly courtesy in addressing this inquiry to this Government. You
                                may further say that while this Government is, of course, mindful of
                                all of its responsibilities and contractual obligations, it is
                                limiting itself at this time to a careful study of the situation in
                                order that the policy of this Government may be determined only
                                after all pertinent facts have been ascertained with complete
                                accuracy. For the time being, consequently, this Government will
                                continue to observe developments. In conveying the foregoing to the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs, you may further state that this
                                Government will be glad of the opportunity of consulting further
                                with the Brazilian Government at a later date concerning this highly
                                important question.</p>

                            <p>382. Decree issued by Governor General but text of which I have not
                                yet received provides that in civil and criminal cases Italian

                                duties”, come under Italian law. In criminal cases they are tried by
                                Italian judges and appeal lies to Court of Appeals in Rome.</p>
                            <p>Eritreans, Italian Somalis, and Libyans are subject to laws of their
                                respective colonies. In penal cases they are tried by Civil Governor
                                of Addis Ababa.</p>
                            <p>Ethiopian natives are tried according to prevailing local customs and
                                by existing magistrates except that native Moslems are tried by
                                Cadis and Ulemas who apply Sheri laws.</p>
                            <p>Whites who acquired Ethiopian nationality (for example Armenians,

                                the information which Mr. Engert sends us, we can consider at a
                                later date the advisability of asking our Embassies in Paris and
                                London to ascertain what the French and British Governments propose
                                to do in this matter.</p>

                            <p>The attached memorandum<note n="1" xml:id="d247fn1">Not
                                    printed.</note> discusses the attitude of the United States with
                                respect to the termination of its extraterritorial jurisdiction in
                                Eastern countries which have been annexed by, or placed under the
                                protection of, great Powers.</p>
                            <p>It appears that in those cases where territory has been annexed
                                outright, as in the case of Madagascar, Tripoli and Korea, we have
                                abandoned our extraterritorial jurisdiction once we have been
                                assured that the annexing Power has established proper courts or
                                extended <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0306"/>our treaty rights
                                to the new territory. On the other hand, in those cases where the
                                territory has merely come under the protection of a great Power, we
                                have as a general rule continued to exercise our extraterritorial
                                rights and have insisted upon a preservation of those rights until
                                we surrendered them by treaty. Thus we continued to exercise our
                                extraterritorial jurisdiction in Tunis long after that country
                                became a French Protectorate and only surrendered our jurisdiction
                                by treaty in 1904.<note n="2" xml:id="d247fn2">Treaty between the

                                    >611</ref>.</note> Mr. Adee was careful, in replying to the
                                request of the Italian Chargé d’Affaires at Washington that we
                                address him a note “recognizing” the annexation, to explain that
                                “the United States did not undertake to form a judgment looking to
                                the recognition of <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> sovereignty” over
                                annexed territories; that we “simply conformed to <hi rend="italic"
                                    >de facto</hi> conditions”. Shortly thereafter, upon receiving
                                notice from Italy that extraterritorial jurisdiction in Tripoli had
                                been terminated, we instructed our diplomatic and consular officers
                                to “conform to the legal situation thus established in Libya”.</p>
                            <p>It might be argued, therefore, that our failure to protest the recent
                                Italian decree extending Italian jurisdiction over American
                                nationals (and other foreigners in Ethiopia) or its application to
                                American nationals would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> constitute <hi
                                    rend="italic">de jure</hi> recognition of the Italian annexation
                                of Ethiopia. However, our failure to protest might be interpreted as
                                a recognition of the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> conditions in
                                Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>From a purely practical point of view, and considering solely the
                                question of the administration of justice to our nationals in
                                Ethiopia, it is hardly to be doubted that Italian tribunals would be
                                superior to those before which our nationals in Ethiopia have come
                                hitherto.</p>
                            <p>In general, it may be said that no final decision can be made with
                                respect to the question of our extraterritorial jurisdiction in
                                Ethiopia until such time as a decision has been made with respect to
                                our recognition of the Italian annexation. In the event such
                                recognition takes place, it is assumed that a final termination of
                                our extraterritorial rights would follow automatically.</p>

                            <p>269. The Chargé d’Affaires at Rome on June 4, 1936, reported<note
                                    n="5" xml:id="d248fn5">Telegram No. 193, June 4, 5 p.m.; not
                                    printed.</note> a strictly confidential conversation with one of
                                his colleagues who had had a discussion with Suvich. According to
                                this source the Italians have not regarded the question of the
                                recognition of Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia as of immediate
                                importance and the impression was gained that the Italian Government
                                had no intention at the time being to confront other Powers with
                                necessity of making a declaration on this point. Apparently Italy
                                was willing to permit the situation to continue for 6 months or more
                                on the present basis, in the thought that <hi rend="italic">de
                                    facto</hi> recognition might be established at the end of that
                                time and that this might be followed in about a year by <hi
                                    rend="italic">de jure</hi> recognition. The most obvious manner
                                in which the question of recognition of Italian sovereignty over
                                Ethiopia might be raised would be through the request by a foreign
                                government for an exequatur for a consular officer in Ethiopia and
                                possibly by the use of the title of Emperor in addressing letters of
                                credence or other diplomatic documents to the King of Italy.
                                Accordingly the question of whether the point would be raised might
                                depend on some step taken by a foreign government rather than
                                because of a demand by the Italian authorities which would have the
                                effect of confronting other Powers with the necessity of a decision
                                on the question of recognition.</p>

                                “Emperor of Ethiopia” to that of the King of Italy. My informal
                                expression of opinion to the Ambassador was that, with respect to
                                the appointment of a new Ambassador here at the present time, we
                                were not in a position to give consideration either favorably or

                                receiving his approval, I sent for the Italian Ambassador this
                                afternoon.</p>
                            <p>On entering the room the Ambassador told me that he regretted that he
                                had no reply to the question which I asked him two weeks ago in
                                regard to the question of the credentials of a new ambassador to
                                Rome as a result of the new title of the King. I said that this was
                                a matter concerning which I should like to make a further
                                suggestion, which seemed necessary in view of the fact that his
                                Government had just asked for the <hi rend="italic">agrément</hi> of
                                Mr. Suvich as Ambassador to the United States and because of the
                                fact that announcement of this fact had already been made in
                                Rome.</p>
                            <p>I told Mr. Rosso that I had already advised the President of his
                                (Rosso’s) transfer and that the President had expressed very deep
                                regret, a sentiment which we all shared. However, we now had to
                                consider simultaneously the question of accrediting a new ambassador
                                to Rome and a new Italian Ambassador to Washington; it was evident,
                                in view of the two weeks delay in answering our first question, that
                                the Italian Government was seriously embarrassed. The suggestion,
                                therefore, which I wished to make was with a view to removing all
                                embarrassment on both sides and was to the effect that this
                                Government would accredit the new American Ambassador to “His
                                Majesty the King of Italy, etc. etc.” or to “His Majesty the King of
                                Italy and possessions beyond the seas”. Mr. Rosso seemed to think
                                that this suggestion might meet the situation and promised to
                                telegraph at once to Rome for an expression of their views. I urged
                                no further delay because I did not want it to appear that we were
                                holding up on the Italian request for the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >agrément</hi> for Mr. Suvich.</p>

                                credence has recently been discussed in diplomatic circles here with

                                Egyptian Minister and the belief has been generally expressed in
                                those circles that the use of the two titles would be required by
                                the Italian authorities. In the last day or two Foreign Office
                                officials have brought up this matter in informal conversation and
                                have said that they are trying to find some solution. They maintain
                                that there is no intention to raise in this way the question of the
                                recognition of Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia but that the decree

                                apply in the case of the appointment of foreign representatives but
                                this was merely an individual opinion expressed in the course of

                            <p>69. Your 214, June 16, 7 p.m. In addition to the question of the
                                appointment of Suvich as Ambassador here, we have been discussing
                                with the Italian Ambassador the matter of the appointment of a new
                                Ambassador at Rome when such an appointment should become necessary.
                                Please discuss both these questions with the Foreign Office
                                informally along the following lines:</p>
                            <p>Endeavor to confirm your understanding that there will be no
                                objection on the part of the Italian Government to the accrediting
                                of a new Ambassador by the President to the King of Italy when the
                                post at Rome becomes vacant.</p>
                            <p>You may further say that there would be no objection to receiving an
                                Ambassador accredited to the President by the King of Italy with the
                                addition of any other titles provided for by Italian law provided it
                                is understood that in accepting letters of credence in any new form
                                this Government is not giving any consideration whatever either
                                favorably or unfavorably to any new questions involved in such an
                                appointment.</p>
                            <p>Please expedite your report on these questions.</p>

                            <p>217. My 216, June 18, noon.<note n="9" xml:id="d253fn9">Not
                                    printed.</note> I discussed at the Foreign Office this afternoon
                                the matter of the use of titles in the case of letters of credence
                                along the lines of the Department’s 69, June 17, 2 p.m. and was told
                                that although the matter was being studied no decision had yet been
                                reached. It was suggested, however, that pending a decision as to a
                                solution the <hi rend="italic">agrément</hi> of Suvich be granted by
                                the American Government and I was told that the Italian Government
                                for its part would accord the <hi rend="italic">agrément</hi> of a
                                new Ambassador to Rome when such an appointment should become
                                necessary. In this connection I was told that the Soviet Government
                                had given its approval of Rosso’s appointment to Moscow on this
                                basis. I was also assured that the Italian Government had no
                                intention of involving a question of recognition of Italian
                                sovereignty over Ethiopia in the matter of the addition of the title
                                of Emperor to that of King of Italy in letters of credence.</p>
                            <p>I was given no indication of the nature of the solution to be reached
                                and was unable to obtain any definite statement as to whether
                                letters of credence addressed to the King of Italy only would be
                                accepted. I was told that the same question was involved and being
                                studied in the case of the appointment of a new Chilean Ambassador
                                and Egyptian Minister whose letters were in the above form. On the
                                other hand, the letters of the new Austrian Minister who has just
                                arrived are addressed to King and Emperor.</p>

                            <p>70. Your 217, June 18, 7 p.m. On June 1 we informed the Italian
                                Ambassador here that the President was considering the appointment
                                of a new Ambassador to Rome and that we desired information as to
                                whether any question would be raised if his letters of credence were
                                in exactly the same form as those of the present Ambassador, namely,
                                addressed to the King of Italy. Since informally presenting this
                                question to Rosso, the Italian Government has asked for the <hi

                                is no intention on the part of the Italian Government to involve any
                                question of recognition of sovereignty over Ethiopia in the matter
                                of an additional title of the King of Italy, we would prefer to have
                                the question of the form of the President’s letter of credence of a
                                new Ambassador decided before giving final consideration to the <hi

                            <p>221. My 217, June 18, 7 p.m., and Department’s 70, June 19, 3 p.m. I
                                understand from Foreign Office that the Italian Government will
                                accept letters of credence addressed to the “King of Italy” but
                                proposes to add the title “Emperor of Ethiopia” in the credentials
                                of Italian representatives. This latter formula it is said has been
                                accepted by the Polish and Soviet Governments in the case of the
                                credentials of the new Italian Ambassadors to those countries. I
                                have been in constant communication with the Foreign Office in
                                regard to this matter and have an appointment there this afternoon
                                when I expect to receive a definite statement.</p>

                            <p>284. In connection with the appointment of a new Italian Ambassador
                                here and the possible appointment of a new American Ambassador at
                                Rome when that post might become vacant, the question has arisen as
                                to the use of the King of Italy’s titles in letters of credence.
                                This matter has been discussed both with the Italian Ambassador here
                                and with the Foreign Office at Rome. It was pointed out to the
                                Ambassador that there would be no objection to receiving an
                                Ambassador accredited to the President by the King of Italy with the
                                addition of any other titles provided for by Italian law, provided
                                    <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0312"/>it was understood that
                                in accepting such letters of credence in any new form this
                                Government was not giving any consideration whatever, either
                                favorably or unfavorably, to any new question involved in such
                                appointment.</p>
                            <p>The American Chargé d’Affaires at Rome learned from the Foreign
                                Office on June 20 that the Italian Government would accept letters
                                of credence addressed to the “King of Italy”, but that it proposes
                                to add the title “Emperor of Ethiopia” in the credentials of Italian
                                diplomatic representatives to foreign countries. The Chargé
                                d’Affaires was told at the same time that the latter term would not
                                be given an interpretation involving considerations affecting the
                                questions of recognition. On June 22 the Chargé d’Affaires reported
                                that letters of credence presented to the King on the preceding day
                                by the new Turkish, Austrian, Egyptian and Haitian Ministers had
                                been addressed to “His Majesty Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy”
                                but that he was informed the letters had been accepted in the name
                                of the King and Emperor.</p>
                            <p>The President yesterday signified his approval of the appointment of
                                Signor Suvich as the new Italian Ambassador at Washington. It will
                                be clear from the above paragraphs that this <hi rend="italic"
                                    >agrément</hi> involves in no way the question of recognition of
                                Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia.</p>

                                course expects to return and the Italian Government has apparently
                                refused to permit any diplomatic officer to enter into Ethiopia for

                            <p>99. In connection with the announcement made last week that the
                                German Government had reduced its representation at Addis Ababa from
                                a legation to a consulate general, several American newspapers
                                reported that this action was equivalent to official recognition of
                                the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> situation in Ethiopia. The <hi
                                    rend="italic">New York Evening Post</hi>, however, published a
                                report emanating from Berlin and categorically denying that the
                                German action was open to such interpretation.</p>
                            <p>Any information you can discreetly obtain regarding the significance
                                of the German action, particularly as to whether it was intended to
                                constitute recognition of the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                                situation in Ethiopia will be appreciated.</p>

                                Office indicated as one of the bases for this action Eden’s
                                statement in the House of Commons a short time ago that Abyssinian
                                Government no longer existed. This agreed with the actual facts
                                which the German Government consider it simpler to recognize as
                                facilitating the better protection of German commercial interests in
                                Abyssinia. Action involved no <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi>
                                from Italy.</p>
                            <p>See paragraph 6 my 219, July 15, 1 p.m.<note n="12" xml:id="d259fn12"

                            <p>Foreign Office further told me in confidence that it was quite
                                prepared to recognize the situation in Ethiopia <hi rend="italic">de
                                    jure</hi> and had so intimated to the Italian Government some
                                weeks ago. Mussolini however had not felt there was any pressing
                                necessity for <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> recognition and the
                                Germans had naturally let the matter drop. They were however
                                prepared to accord <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> recognition if and
                                when desirable. Foreign Office added that as a matter of fact when
                                the necessary law was passed in Germany for the creation of a
                                Consulate General at Addis Ababa, which would be shortly, the
                                exequatur would to all <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0314"

                                recognition. Commenting briefly on question of nonrecognition of
                                Manchukuo Foreign Office felt that the two situations were not
                                comparable. For one thing China still existed as a government
                                whereas Abyssinia did not. Therefore no implications of recognition
                                of Manchukuo arise from the Abyssinian matter.</p>

                            <p>Various ministers have called here to inquire as to the circumstances
                                of our recent exchange of new ambassadors with Italy—specifically
                                whether, in making this exchange, we referred to the King of Italy
                                as “Emperor of Ethiopia”.</p>
                            <p>We have replied, orally in every instance, that the exchange of new
                                ambassadors and their letters of credence changed in no way the
                                relations between the United States and Italy, and that no new
                                questions arose as a result thereof. We have informed them that Mr.
                                Phillips’ letters of credence were addressed to the “King of Italy”
                                and that Mr. Suvich’s letters to the President were from the “King
                                of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia”. But this, we emphasized,
                                constituted no change in the relations between the two
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>We have not informed these ministers who have called of the agreement
                                with the Italian Government whereby no question of recognizing
                                Italian dominion over Ethiopia would arise as a consequence of the
                                action in exchanging ambassadors. We have not made any written
                                communication to any government in connection with this matter.</p>

                            <p>The Italian Ambassador called on me by appointment on October 30 in
                                the following connection:</p>
                            <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0315"/>
                            <p>Mr. Suvich said that at the time of Germany’s recognition of Italian
                                conquest of Ethiopia he had noticed certain comment in the American
                                press to the effect that Germany’s action need not and would not
                                constitute in any way a precedent for similar action by this
                                Government. The press comment went on to say, however, that
                                Latin-American countries would undoubtedly be guided by the
                                viewpoint in this matter of the American Government.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador desired to inquire informally whether any
                                “understanding” existed between this Government and the governments
                                of Latin-America with respect to the recognition of the Italian
                                conquest. He added that his Government hoped that a question of this
                                kind would be decided independently by the various countries of this
                                hemisphere.</p>
                            <p>In reply I remarked to the Ambassador that speculation by news
                                writers in the American press should not of course be taken as
                                necessarily reflecting authoritative opinion. Furthermore, that the
                                press report itself appears to have commented only on the alleged
                                viewpoint of Latin-American countries in this matter and did not
                                purport to interpret this Government’s views. As regards any
                                “understanding” on this subject between this Government and other
                                governments of Latin-America, referred to by the Ambassador, I
                                stated that I was not aware of any such development and was sure
                                that none existed.</p>

                            <p>63. In strictest confidence Ministry of Foreign Affairs has
                                communicated to me orally and informally that it apprehends that new
                                Italian Minister now on the way to San José may present credentials
                                implying the imperial sovereignty of the King of Italy over
                                Abyssinia. The Costa Rican Government would be greatly aided in
                                meeting such eventuality if it had intimation whether and how we
                                have met it and if we have not met it how it might be met assuming

                            <p>46. Tour 63, November 2, 12 noon. In reply to various inquiries from
                                resident diplomatic representatives in connection with recent
                                exchange of Ambassadors with Italy Department has stated orally that
                                Ambassador Phillips’ letter of credence was addressed only to “King
                                of Italy” while that of Ambassador Suvich was from “King of Italy
                                and Emperor of Ethiopia”. Department has emphasized that the
                                latter’s reception does not raise any new question concerning the
                                relationship between the United States and Italy. No written
                                communication has been made by the Department to any Government in
                                connection with the foregoing.</p>
                            <p>You may communicate the above orally to the Minister for Foreign

                            <p>512. The British Ambassador called today evidently for the purpose of
                                asking for information with respect to a change of personnel in
                                Addis Ababa presumably basing his inquiry upon a press report from
                                Washington published here to the effect that Hughes is being
                                transferred to Addis Ababa as Consul General.<note n="14"

                                    ff.</note> Upon being informed of the Department’s views he
                                proceeded to tell me the situation with regard to British
                                representation there. He said that all the smaller powers in Europe
                                were pressing the British Government to come to some sort of an
                                understanding with Italy concerning Ethiopia in the interests of
                                general European peace and that his Government have now under
                                consideration a change from diplomatic to purely consular
                                representation. In his opinion this might well occur before the end
                                of the present year. He added that discussions were being carried on
                                now between London and Paris with this in view.</p>

                                    Ambassador in Italy.</note> said that while any step taken by
                                the British Government would undoubtedly be qualified by a statement
                                that it did not constitute “de jure” recognition it would
                                nevertheless amount to <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0317"/>“de
                                facto” recognition. He admitted that he had discussed the matter
                                with Count Ciano and that he had made it very clear that the British
                                decision bore no relations whatsoever to the conversations now being
                                carried on with respect to a Mediterranean accord.<note n="16"

                                probable addition might be the inclusion of a reference to the

                            <p>On December 21st His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome communicated to the
                                Italian Government the decision of His Majesty’s Government in the
                                United Kingdom to withdraw the British Legation at Addis Ababa and
                                to substitute for it a Consulate-General. At the same time he asked
                                for assurances from the Italian Government that British consular
                                officers in Abyssinia would be accorded all customary privileges
                                including that of communicating freely (e. g. in cypher) with their
                                government and with each other, consulate bags being exempted from
                                customs and all other examination. This was agreed <pb n="253"
                                    xml:id="pg_253" facs="0318"/>to. Sir Eric Drummond also asked
                                that the new British Consulate-General at Addis Ababa and the
                                Consulate at Harrar should continue to use their wireless sets for
                                reception purposes. To this Count Ciano agreed, subject to a
                                reservation of the Italian right to reexamine the question in the
                                future, when for instance other questions relating to Abyssinia
                                might be under discussion, or when improved conditions in the
                                country justified such reconsideration.</p>
                            <p>Sir Eric Drummond explained that His Majesty’s Government in the
                                United Kingdom had been proceeding on the assumption that exequaturs
                                would be both necessary and desirable to confirm the status of the
                                Consuls, and consequently they intended to apply to the Italian
                                Government therefor, though on the distinct understanding that such
                                action would not be interpreted as <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi>
                                recognition of the Italian annexation of Abyssinia. Count Ciano
                                answered that he fully appreciated His Majesty’s Government’s
                                reserve, and assured Sir Eric Drummond that the question of <hi
                                    rend="italic">de jure</hi> recognition would not arise.</p>
                            <p>In adopting the view that the application for exequaturs would not
                                involve <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> recognition of the Italian
                                annexation of Abyssinia His Majesty’s Government were influenced
                                    (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) by the precedent of neutral consuls
                                who, it is stated, during the German occupation of Belgium were
                                granted exequaturs by the German Government without this presumably
                                committing their government to anything more than recognition of the
                                Germans as in <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> control of the country
                                and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) by the fact that in an unofficial
                                conversation last July the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs told
                                His Majesty’s Chargé d’Affaires at Rome that he could give an
                                assurance that the reduction of the Legation would not be regarded
                                by the Italian Government or press as involving recognition.
                                Furthermore, with regard to the recent agreement between Italy and
                                Japan, resulting in the reduction of the Japanese Legation at Addis
                                Ababa to a Consulate-General, His Majesty’s Government’s latest
                                information indicates, notwithstanding Italian press comment to the
                                contrary, that this is not held by the Japanese to imply <hi
                                    rend="italic">de jure</hi> recognition of the new Empire on the
                                part of Japan. Finally when the Greek Minister at Rome recently
                                communicated to the Italian Government the decision of the Greek
                                Government to establish a Consulate-General at Addis Ababa, and
                                asked for an exequatur for the Consul-General, the Italian
                                Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs told him that “this
                                action constituted a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> recognition of
                                Italian occupation”. Since then His Majesty’s Government have learnt
                                that the Greek Government contemplate going one step further and
                                recognising the Italian conquest of Abyssinia.</p>
                            <p>It is realised that the action which has now been taken by His
                                Majesty’s Government involves <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                                recognition of the Italian Government as the government of the parts
                                of Abyssinia which they control, but this is no more than the
                                recognition of facts which <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0319"
                                />indisputably exist, and His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State
                                for Foreign Affairs would be prepared to state both to the Italian
                                Government and, if necessary, in the House of Commons, that such is
                                the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. It is appreciated too that
                                in practice the distinction between such recognition and <hi
                                    rend="italic">de jure</hi> recognition is small, though for
                                political reasons it may still be desirable to retain it.</p>

                            <p>263. Situation in the city evidently rapidly getting out of hand.
                                Police protection has broken down and most shops have been looted.
                                Much firing on all sides and although no specifically anti-foreign
                                demonstrations circulation in streets extremely hazardous. The
                                authorities seem to have distributed large quantities of rifles and
                                ammunition with the idea that Addis Ababa would be defended but when
                                the Government disappeared these arms became a menace in the hands
                                of irresponsible persons.</p>

                            <p>265. Center of town is now burning fiercely including Post Office.
                                Deafening noise from incessant firing even in immediate vicinity of
                                Legation but no shots fired into our compound. Some danger from
                                ricochet bullets of which three hit our buildings and we are keeping
                                under cover as much as possible.</p>
                            <p>Vice Consul Cramp’s house was sacked while he was at the Legation and
                                he has lost practically everything. Fate of Vice Consul Hunter’s
                                belongings not yet known. Both now staying at Legation.</p>
                            <p>Thirty Greeks and six Russians, men, women and children, have just
                                sought refuge in this Legation and I am sheltering and feeding them
                                temporarily as they could not safely reach any of the other

                            <p>267. Fire is spreading but fortunately not in direction of Legation.
                                Thousands of natives have all day long been quietly evacuating the
                                city. It would appear that most of the damage was done by
                                comparatively few rowdy elements who could easily have been held in
                                check by a small police force in the beginning.</p>
                            <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0321"/>
                            <p>It is almost inevitable that a report should be circulating that the
                                Ethiopian Government had decided to destroy the capital rather than
                                turn it over to the Italians but I do not credit it.</p>
                            <p>Shall send no further bulletins until tomorrow morning unless the

                            <p>274. My messenger has just returned from Sudan Interior Mission at
                                Furi and reports everybody well and safe. There seems to have been a
                                little anxiety for a while but nothing serious happened.</p>
                            <p>Although messenger was unable to get through to American Mission
                                Gullali because of heavy firing, I believe I would have heard if
                                they were in trouble as the mission is comparatively near the
                                Legation. However, the fact that he could not get through and that
                                just then an Abyssinian child was shot down near our front gate and
                                a mob was reported to be approaching made it seem wise to send
                                message to British Legation to send trucks at least for evacuation
                                of Greeks and Russians, 4 Armenian girls and some 15 British Somalis
                                who had joined them since yesterday. This was done and I believe
                                they reached British Legation safely thus relieving my mind of a
                                great burden as our food supplies were totally insufficient for such
                                large numbers and I could not have afforded them real protection in
                                case of serious trouble.</p>

                            <p>276. British Legation very kindly sent not only three trucks but
                                Consul Hope Gill, Military Attaché Taylor, and Captain Keene in
                                command of 15 Sikhs of their Legation Guard. After obtaining from
                                them latest information regarding general situation I decided to
                                evacuate women and children only.</p>
                            <p>Following therefore left 1 p.m. for British Legation in two trucks
                                escorted by the Sikhs: Misses Dommermuth, French, and Shippey with
                                an adopted child; my two children and their governess; Clerk Fidele,
                                British subject, wife and two children; family of our Amharic
                                scribe, Ato Yohanness; and Weeks, colored American. Mrs. Engert
                                desired to remain at the Legation to encourage other native servants
                                whose family live in the compound and I consented.</p>
                            <p>With Cramp, Hunter, and our four radiomen, all of whom have shown
                                admirable courage and coolness, I expect to be able to hold the
                                Legation against anything but an organized attack from different
                                directions. Following Americans are also assisting: Spencer, Ames,
                                and Du Berrier, as well as Clerk, Hartman, a white Russian,
                                Angelopoulos, Greek, representing International News, and a
                                Czechoslovakian in my employ. Among us we have 9 rifles, 2 shotguns,
                                and 10 revolvers with fair amount of ammunition. I feel very
                                strongly, and my companions agree with me, that we should not
                                abandon the Legation and radio station without determined effort to
                                hold them as they would certainly be pillaged and burnt after our
                                departure.</p>
                            <p>Should situation become much worse, which I do not anticipate, the
                                Department may depend on my withdrawing before it is too late. The
                                British have left us a truck for that purpose.</p>
                            <p>Several fresh fires have started in town but the Legation is not
                                threatened by them. Shooting has been less intense during last hour
                                or so.</p>
                            <p>Shall report again in the morning via Cavite.</p>

                            <p>279. First definite attempt to gain access to the Legation was made
                                by a band of marauders this morning. Between 8:45 and 9 a.m. they
                                suddenly attacked our two widely separated back gates with heavy <pb
                                    n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0324"/>rifle fire from behind
                                trees and fences, peppering with bullets back yards where Mrs.
                                Engert and Spencer happened to be standing at the moment.
                                Unfortunately as the early morning had been comparatively quiet,
                                Cramp had volunteered to go by car to Seventh Day Adventist hospital
                                some 2 miles from here to see if he could be of assistance and also
                                to have an infected hand of radioman Anslo attended to. In view of
                                somewhat hazardous nature of journey he took with him Chief Radioman
                                Tanner, my chauffeur, my two native Legation guards and five rifles.
                                And as two newspapermen and Du Berrier had left at 6 a.m. to try
                                locate Italians, we were a rather depleted garrison. It is extremely
                                likely that bandits had been watching departures since last night
                                and concluded place had been practically evacuated.</p>
                            <p>However, thanks to loyalty of our native servants including cooks who
                                at once rushed to defend gates with only a few revolvers, spears and
                                swords until the rest of us arrived with pistols and shotguns, we
                                made much greater show of numbers than attackers expected. After
                                brisk exchange of shots in course of which at least one bandit was
                                either killed or wounded they were driven off.</p>
                            <p>I cannot speak too highly of my comrades who grasped at once the
                                importance of energetic action. Pitts, Cavannah and Hunter, without
                                waiting for orders, rushed fearlessly to take up strategic positions
                                while Hartman and Spencer showed fine sense of discipline and
                                cooperation. Whole incident proves again that a few armed white men
                                can easily hold their own provided opponents are not in overwhelming
                                numbers. I am particularly encouraged by attitude of our native help
                                mentioned above which I confess I had not expected in an
                                emergency.</p>

                            <p>282. Two messengers I sent to British Legation today could not get
                                through. As communication with that Legation is essential if we are
                                to remain here please communicate immediately via London my request
                                to Sir Sidney Barton, British Minister here, that he get in touch
                                with me. Kindly state also that with the assistance of a few Sikhs
                                and one Lewis gun we could hold this Legation if Italians arrive
                                within few days. I feel it would be a great pity to be obliged to
                                abandon it and radio to certain destruction after holding it for 3
                                strenuous days. Please acknowledge receipt.</p>

                            <p>Immediately upon receipt of Mr. Engert’s telegram No. 282 of May 4, 3
                                p.m., I put in a long distance call for Ambassador Bingham in London
                                and read to him (at 10:30 a.m.) Mr. Engert’s telegram.</p>
                            <p>I requested the Ambassador to communicate Mr. Engert’s message at
                                once by telephone to the Foreign Office and stated that I would hold
                                the long distance wire until he could give me their reply.</p>
                            <p>Long distance communications were meanwhile broken and the Ambassador
                                was not able to reach me again until 11:15 a.m. He then informed me
                                that he had gotten into immediate telephone communication with the
                                British Permanent Under Secretary, Sir Robert Vansittart, who
                                informed him that the British Government had received no
                                communications thus far today from Sir Sidney Barton, the British
                                Minister at Addis Ababa. Sir Robert stated, however, that an
                                immediate effort would be made to communicate Mr. Engert’s message
                                to Sir Sidney by radio and that he would inform the Ambassador at
                                once of the results.</p>
                            <p>I then read to the Ambassador Mr. Engert’s later telegram No. 283 of
                                May 4, 5 p.m., and asked him to communicate it at once to Sir Robert
                                for communication by radio to Sir Sidney Barton.</p>
                            <p>I requested the Ambassador to keep us advised, by the quickest means,
                                of any further information that he might receive from the British
                                Government. This the Ambassador promised to do.</p>

                            <p>285. British Legation was apparently unable to get in touch with us.
                                Feel confident we can at least hold out until tomorrow as the
                                situation has not changed for the worse since this afternoon. Owing
                                to rain perhaps even slightly improved. Government buildings of old

                                defence of the American Legation which is 5 miles away and outside
                                any defence scheme and the British Legation has already had to send
                                a detachment of their guard to protect the Belgian Legation whose
                                occupation by the rioters would endanger the British Legation. The
                                British Legation has barely enough to ensure the defence for 1200
                                refugees of whom very few can be used as volunteers. The American
                                Legation was visited by an armed convoy from the British Legation
                                last night and offered evacuation which was refused except for their
                                women.</p>

                                take advantage of the opportunity afforded you.</p>

                                factor and you should have no hesitancy in leaving as soon as the

                            <p>125. Department’s No. 37, May 4. I have just called by appointment on
                                the Director for Political Affairs at the Foreign Office and have
                                requested information as to the steps which the Royal Government is
                                adopting to meet its responsibility to protect the lives of
                                foreigners in Addis Ababa and as to when the Italian forces may be
                                expected to reach Addis Ababa in order to render such protection. In
                                making this inquiry I emphasized the fact that I was requesting
                                information solely as to whether the Italian authorities were
                                prepared to meet the responsibilities which they are called upon to
                                discharge as a result of the situation which they have created.</p>
                            <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0330"/>
                            <p>I was informed that Italian troops were hastening the occupation of
                                Addis Ababa and that as soon as the city was occupied all possible
                                measures would be taken to protect the lives and property of
                                foreigners in accordance with the rules of war. I was also told that
                                exact information as to when the Italian troops might be expected to
                                enter the city was not known but that it was believed to be only a
                                question of hours and that in the meanwhile Italian aeroplanes were
                                flying over the city in order to dispel bands of marauders and to
                                render all possible protection to foreigners.</p>
                            <p>I desire to add that when in the course of the conversation I
                                referred to the situation in Addis Ababa as a consequence of the
                                disappearance of the Ethiopian Government as a result of the Italian
                                military advance, the Foreign Office official countered with the
                                statement that the Italians had not attacked Addis Ababa and that
                                the rioting there could have been prevented if the Negus in
                                departing had left a police force to preserve order in the city. I
                                gathered the impression therefore that, although the Italian
                                Government will take all possible steps to protect the lives of
                                foreigners in Addis Ababa, there is a probability that it would not
                                admit the responsibility for the creation of the situation of danger
                                itself prevailing there. If, therefore, this point should be further
                                clarified please instruct. I am seeing Suvich on another matter at
                                6:30 this afternoon.</p>

                            <p>292. Suddenly at about 10:20 p.m., the Legation was fired upon from
                                behind the fences on the northern side. The entire quarter began a
                                continuous firing and the Legation personnel concentrated a heavy
                                return fire on the side of the attack. After about 5 minutes the
                                attackers retired.</p>
                            <p>As it would appear that the Italian troops have not occupied this
                                side of the town and are probably more than a mile away in its
                                center, I have decided to request an armed guard for the Legation
                                for the night and am sending a car heavily armed to the city

                                excellent source that Italian authorities have requested the

                                this request would probably be acceded to since Italian authorities
                                have undertaken to preserve order in Addis Ababa. It is added that
                                as soon as British Minister is convinced that proper protection is
                                being given to British interests, the British diplomatic mission
                                would presumably be replaced by a consular office.</p>

                                from my interview is that the Italians are exceedingly nervous

                                Addis Ababa during the rainy season. Communications with Dessie have
                                largely been impossible for a week and the railway is by no means

                            <p>476. Your 308, July 14. The Department’s thoughtfulness is much
                                appreciated. I had naturally already made a close study of the
                                situation but found it so obscure that definite conclusions seemed
                                difficult. However, the following is my considered opinion in the
                                light of the information available to me at the present moment: <list>
                                    <label>(1)</label>
                                    <item>About 2 or 3 weeks ago the Italians felt decidedly alarmed
                                        lest their comparatively small garrison in Addis Ababa be
                                        completely invested. Had an Ethiopian force of say 10,000

                                        would have had to be abandoned and with the railway cut it
                                        might well have ended in disaster. Not much protection could
                                        under such circumstances have been expected from the
                                        Italians.</item>

                                    <item>The realization of the danger has had a salutary effect
                                        upon the Italian rulers. They are now believed to have a

                                        against villages within 50 miles of the section which had
                                        been cut are expected to have a deterrent effect. Local
                                        garrison is gradually to be increased to a full division and
                                        artillery has been placed on neighboring hills. Several
                                        relatively clear days have permitted aerial reconnaissance
                                        which is said to have reported absence of any large bodies

                                        of 60 French soldiers—would be quite willing to receive and
                                        protect any Americans who can get there unaided, this
                                        particular problem would now be largely one of
                                        transportation. The Department will recall that the British
                                        not only brought several trucks every time they came to this
                                        Legation during the last troubles but even left one for us
                                        to use independently. I, therefore, beg to suggest that I be
                                        authorized to hire a truck for the duration of the present
                                        emergency or even to purchase an inexpensive second hand one
                                        should none be available for hire. I consider this more
                                        important than additional guards or arms.</item>

                                        advisable to try to obtain an option on renting the Belgian
                                        Legation which now stands empty. We only have a month to
                                        month lease on our present premises and as the owners are a
                                        semi-governmental institution, the Italians may bring
                                        pressure on them to terminate it. Belgian Legation is very
                                        desirable property and, being next on the border to the
                                        British Legation, forms part of the British defense system
                                        and could thus afford protection to the entire American
                                        colony. Belgian Chargé des Affaires lives in town and tells
                                        me his Government would probably have no objection to
                                        subletting to us temporarily but he does not know precisely
                                        what arrangements it has with the Russian Government which
                                        is the owner. I feel it would be worthwhile making informal
                                        inquiries through our Embassy in Brussels and we could, of
                                        course, assure the Belgian Government that in an emergency
                                        we should be glad to give shelter to the few Belgian
                                        subjects who are here.</item>

                                        which in turn would render my relations with Graziani more

                                <item>In short, the Department is desirous of taking every possible
                                    precaution with a view to preventing the Legation staff and
                                    American nationals in Addis Ababa from again being subjected to
                                    such a situation as occurred early in May. To this end the
                                    question of subletting the Belgian Legation has been taken up at
                                    Brussels. Pending the receipt of a reply of which you will be
                                    advised please telegraph the earliest date on which you could
                                    cancel the lease on the present Legation.</item>

                            <p>56. Department’s 24, July 20, 6 p.m. Belgian Foreign Office has
                                informed me that the Belgian Government regrets that it is not in a
                                position to sublease its legation quarters at Addis Ababa. This
                                property belonged to the Czarist Government of Russia and was
                                confiscated by the Ethiopian Government after the Bolshevik
                                revolution. The Belgian Government rents the property from the Negus
                                and its present 3–year lease which expires on January 1, 1938,
                                contains a clause allowing the Negus to cancel it at any time upon 3
                                months’ notice. This clause was introduced in view of the
                                possibility of a recognition of the Soviet Government by Ethiopia.
                                In view of the above facts Belgian Foreign Office states that it
                                would be impossible both from a technical and legal standpoint to
                                sublease the property and it would also be awkward for the Belgian
                                Government from a political point of view because its subleasing of
                                the property would probably be construed as an acquiescence in the
                                Italian desire regarding the withdrawal of foreign missions from
                                Ethiopia. The Belgian Government does not wish to appear to be the
                                first government to take such action.</p>

                            <p>27. Your 56, July 22, 6 p.m. Please discuss this matter again with
                                the Foreign Office and urge reconsideration in the light of the
                                following information.</p>
                            <p>The present American Legation is situated in a different quarter of
                                the city from other foreign legations and is in a particularly
                                exposed position. Our information indicates that during the present
                                rainy season there may be a recrudescence of attacks on foreigners
                                with resulting danger to the staff of our Legation and American
                                nationals in general. The Belgian Legation, which is now unoccupied,
                                is located next to the British Legation and within the defense
                                system of the latter. Accordingly if the Belgian Government does not
                                feel justified in considering subleasing for an extended term, which
                                the Department would prefer, it might be willing to sublease for a
                                period of 3 months by which time the rains will have ceased and the
                                protection of foreigners become less difficult.</p>
                            <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0340"/>
                            <p>Use your best endeavors to persuade the Foreign Office that such a
                                temporary lease would not raise the difficulties which were
                                envisaged in your telegram under reference.</p>

                            <p>497. Rifle fire in the neighborhood of the Legation started at about
                                11 a.m. and a few minutes later a stray bullet came through the roof
                                of our Chancery and lodged in the wall behind clerk Fidele’s chair.
                                Had he been sitting at his desk at that moment he would almost
                                certainly have been hit.</p>
                            <p>Firing in the immediate vicinity of this Legation seems totally
                                unnecessary and I am making urgent representations to the
                                authorities to put a stop to it.</p>
                            <p>There is no indication of an organized large scale attack on the city
                                and the sporadic outbreaks here and there could easily be dealt with
                                if the Italians did not lose their heads so easily.</p>

                                despite use of artillery, Italians have been unable to dislodge
                                Abyssinian force of some 2,000 men who are said to be
                                surrounded.</p>
                            <p>As both Legations are entirely exposed to stray shots I am convinced

                            <p>501. Italian authorities inform me that the Ethiopian bands which
                                yesterday and the day before attacked the city have been
                                successfully beaten off with a loss of about a thousand in killed
                                and wounded. Local population remained calm and did not assist the
                                enemy but Coptic Bishop Petros was found guilty of complicity and
                                was publicly executed yesterday afternoon. I am assured that the
                                city is no longer in any danger and that all necessary measures have
                                been taken for the adequate protection of this Legation and of the
                                American institutions.</p>

                                July 21, 5 p.m.</p>
                            <p>On the assumption that the danger described in your 499, July 29, 3
                                p.m. no longer exists, I feel strongly that you should move into
                                Belgian Legation at earliest possible moment and as soon as
                                necessary <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0342"/>arrangements can
                                be made. In this connection I again stress the fact that the safety
                                of the Legation personnel and of American nationals must take
                                precedence over all other considerations. For that reason I require
                                your recommendations urgently while you still have confidential
                                means of communication which presumably may be terminated without
                                notice.</p>
                            <p>If you move to Belgian Legation will you still need funds referred to
                                in paragraphs 7 and 12 of your 476, July 16, 9 a.m.?</p>

                                <item>As the Italian story by no means gives the entire picture, I
                                    am still of the opinion that the Belgian Legation would at the
                                    present moment offer no advantage over ours. A Sikh guardsman
                                    recently received stray bullet through his hand in the British
                                    Legation compound. So long as fighting continues all foreigners
                                    are in danger but our Legation is just now less exposed than
                                    others.</item>

                                <item>Move to the Belgian Legation would be advisable chiefly if
                                    natives in the city should rise against the Italians. Events of
                                    the last few days indicate that if that should occur it is now
                                    much less likely to succeed. But fighting on the outskirts may
                                    intermittently take place throughout the rainy season.</item>

                            <p>508. Referring to the first paragraph of the Department’s 316, July
                                21, 5 p.m., the French Minister has announced to me that the
                                Governor of French Somaliland finds himself in an embarrassing
                                position. He is not by law empowered to allow any arms to be shipped
                                to Ethiopia unless authorization of “Ethiopian Government” has first
                                been obtained. Permit by Italian authorities in occupation cannot be
                                substituted and he has consistently refused all requests for transit
                                of arms and munitions from every source. He fears that if he made
                                one exception he would have to make others as the Italians have
                                repeatedly asked for special consideration as regards shotguns,
                                revolvers, etc., of a non-military character but he has declined in
                                every instance.</p>
                            <p>As the French Minister could offer no suggestion regarding a way out
                                of the difficulty, it is possible that if our Embassy in Paris took
                                the matter up, the French Government may discover some technical
                                point under which the shipment could in our judgment be permitted to
                                go forward.</p>

                                    and it is counting in this situation on your assurance that all
                                    unnecessary risks will be avoided.</item>

                            <p>295. (1) Last March the Department shipped 6 rifles, 6 pistols and
                                600 rounds of ammunition, together with gas masks, saddles, etc.,
                                for use by our Legation at Addis Ababa. It now appears that this
                                shipment has been held at Djibouti by the French authorities for
                                several months.</p>
                            <p>(2) As the Department is most anxious to provide the Legation at
                                Addis Ababa with means of self-protection in case of need you should
                                make urgent representations to the French Government for the
                                issuance of orders which will facilitate the immediate forwarding of
                                the shipment to Engert.</p>
                            <p>(3) For your confidential information, the French Minister at Addis
                                Ababa has explained the delay as follows:</p>
                            <p>The Governor of French Somaliland is not by law empowered to allow
                                any arms to be shipped to Ethiopia unless authorization of
                                “Ethiopian Government” has first been obtained. Permit by Italian
                                authorities in occupation cannot be substituted and the Governor has
                                consistently refused all requests for transit of arms and munitions
                                from every source. The Governor fears that if he made one exception
                                he would have to make others as the Italians have repeatedly asked
                                for special consideration as regards shotguns, revolvers, etc., of a
                                non-military character, but he has declined in every instance.</p>
                            <p>(4) The Department assumes that the difficulty cited by the Governor
                                of French Somaliland relates to the treaty of August 21, 1930,<note

                                As this agreement specifies that its purpose is to “insure an
                                effective supervision over the trade in arms and munitions” for the
                                “preservation of internal order”, the Department is of the opinion
                                that its provisions should not be applied to arms destined for the
                                defense of the American Legation against possible internal
                                disturbances. The Department is strengthened in this view by the
                                exemptions provided in Article 15 in favor of arms dispatched to the
                                forces of the signatory powers wherever located. If necessary you
                                may bring the contents of this paragraph to the attention of the

                                will soon attack the city from the south while Aberra and Imru will
                                renew their attacks from the west and northeast.</p>

                                conditions Italians soaring planes from Diredawa continue to
                                reconnoiter and bomb environs of Addis Ababa. Two of them recently
                                were either brought down by rifle fire or crashed accidentally
                                killing their 13 occupants.</p>
                            <p>The local situation is quiet and the Italians have erected numerous
                                stone parapets with barbed wire throughout the city to guard against
                                a possible native uprising. I have asked for and received 10 Italian
                                rifles and ammunition but shall not request machine guns until I
                                feel the situation warrants having an Italian guard quartered in our

                            <p>536. I have been officially informed that a band of some 1500
                                Ethiopians attacked the local aerodrome night before last but were
                                defeated. Ethiopian casualties were about 200 while the Italian
                                native troops lost 15 killed and about 40 wounded.</p>

                            <p>538. According to reliable information received this morning Italian
                                losses in the fighting on August 26 and 27 were far more serious
                                than what is the general impression in my 533 and 536 August 28.
                                Sudan Interior Mission which was relatively near scene of action
                                learned from an Italian Askari that a force of over 300 Askaris was
                                ambushed some 5 miles from the airfield and was completely
                                annihilated. Another small force which went to its assistance lost
                                nearly half of its men before it could extricate itself.</p>
                            <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0347"/>
                            <p>I am told that by way of retaliation bombing planes have been
                                instructed to wipe out all villages within 30 miles of the
                                aerodrome.</p>
                            <p>I have warned the members of the Sudan Interior Mission of the danger
                                but they prefer to stay where they are. I have, therefore, again
                                requested Italian Headquarters to do everything possible for their
                                protection and this has been promised.</p>

                            <p>350. The following is a paraphrase of a confidential telegram of
                                September 9, 1936, from the Embassy at London:<note n="43"
                                    xml:id="d327fn43">Not printed.</note>
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>It is stated by the Foreign Office that after the most
                                        careful consideration and interchange of views with Captain
                                        Erskine, the British Consul at Gore, the British High
                                        Commissioner in Egypt and the authorities in the Sudan, a
                                        decision has been reached to evacuate Captain Erskine to
                                        Gambela where for the time being he will set up his
                                        Consulate, the British having a Sudanese guard stationed at
                                        that place and having effective control of this region. The
                                        British reached this decision in spite of the disadvantages
                                        of withdrawing the British Consul from Gore since he has a
                                        certain amount of influence with the local native leaders
                                        and is the only reliable source of information. However,
                                        they believe that if Captain Erskine remains at Gore any
                                        longer he may be cut off from any chance later of escaping
                                        to Gambela and his life would be seriously endangered. It is
                                        realized by the British that any possibility of reliable
                                        communication with the foreigners, including Americans, in
                                        the Cambato district will no longer exist when the Consulate
                                        at Gore is closed. Prior to reaching the decision to
                                        withdraw Captain Erskine the British had carefully examined
                                        the possibility of his immediate evacuation by air in a
                                        moment of crisis, but on the basis of what they believe to
                                        be expert information, they have been compelled to the
                                        conclusion that it would be entirely impracticable to
                                        evacuate him by air from Gore. The British therefore are not
                                        willing to let Captain Erskine remain at Gore in danger of
                                        his life merely for the purpose of obtaining precarious
                                        information when conditions of chaos outside of Gore make it
                                        impossible for him to render to the foreigners in that area
                                        any effective assistance.</p>
                                    <p>It was further indicated by the Foreign Office that their
                                        information is to the effect that conditions are appalling
                                        generally in Western Ethiopia, there being no effective
                                        control of any description or semblance of government. The
                                        British for months have been urging that their remaining
                                        nationals depart. Little doubt exists that the personal
                                        security of the scattered foreign missionaries, merchants
                                        and <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0348"/>others is in
                                        great jeopardy and, except for a realistic understanding of
                                        the dangers to which they are exposed and which it appears
                                        they will have to meet as best they can, there is nothing
                                        they can depend upon.</p>

                            <p>555. I have conferred with my British colleague regarding the
                                contents of the Department’s 350, September 11, 6 p.m. He tells me
                                he has urged his Government to keep Erskine at Gore for at least
                                another month or 6 weeks to permit British subjects in Jimma to
                                reach Gore before his withdrawal provided travel in that direction
                                is possible.</p>
                            <p>Please see my 552, and 553 September 13th.<note n="46"

                                to Jimma and Soddu explaining the situation and urging Americans to
                                leave if they do not consider the journey too hazardous. It is
                                possible that the Americans in Jimma may decide to depart if and

                                traders a sufficiently large armed caravan could probably be formed
                                to offer resistance to marauding bands. It is not yet clear whether
                                the route to Addis Ababa or to Gore is at present the less
                                dangerous.</p>
                            <p>As regards the missionaries at Soddu and nearby districts I doubt

                            <p>Evacuation to Kenya seems out of the question. Besides, the British

                            <p>356. Department’s 350, September 11, 6 p.m. The following is a
                                paraphrase of a telegram of September 14, 1936, from the Ambassador
                                at London:<note n="49" xml:id="d329fn49">Not printed.</note>
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>It is stated by the Foreign Office that inasmuch as Captain
                                        Erskine is the only white foreign official in southwestern
                                        Ethiopia he has assumed the protection of all foreigners as
                                        well as British subjects in that region in so far as
                                        possible. The Foreign Office states that in the instructions
                                        sent to him for evacuating Gore he was requested to urge
                                        upon all foreigners with whom he could communicate that it
                                        was necessary for them to leave. It was further stipulated
                                        in the authorization for him to evacuate Gore that he should
                                        do so after satisfying himself that everything possible had
                                        been done to evacuate those foreigners who were willing to
                                        leave and as regards all those who insisted on remaining
                                        that he make clear to them the danger they were incurring
                                        and that their remaining must be at their own risk. The
                                        instructions on this point in fact were so explicit that the
                                        Foreign Office does not feel it is necessary to issue
                                        additional instructions.</p>
                                    <p>It was stated in the last message from Captain Erskine of
                                        September 10, 1936, to the Foreign Office that he was
                                        “holding” Ras Imru in Gore until the evacuation had been
                                        accomplished of foreigners who would leave. Captain Erskine
                                        indicated that no agreement existed among the Amharic
                                        officials at Gore and that Galla raids were a constant
                                        menace. From what I have been told of the correspondence
                                        between Captain Erskine and the Foreign Office I feel
                                        convinced that both have felt the moral responsibility of
                                        Captain Erskine for the other foreigners in his district and
                                        that everything in his power has been done to aid them and
                                        to advise those with whom he was able to get in touch.</p>
                                    <p>There has been communicated to the Foreign Office the list of
                                        Americans forwarded with the Department’s instruction No.

                            <p>704. To illustrate the state of insecurity which still prevails in
                                the capital, I desire to report that last night a band of 50 or 60
                                natives attacked a house only about 300 yards from this legation and
                                200 yards from an Italian military post. Owner escaped but his wife
                                was killed and their money and valuables were stolen. Italian
                                soldiers called by the owner failed to catch a single one of the
                                bandits although they kept up brisk rifle and machine gun fire for
                                over half an hour.</p>
                            <p>I have been hearing of similar incidents reported in other parts of
                                the city but as the Italian authorities maintain strictest secrecy
                                concerning such matters the above is the first one I have been able
                                to verify.</p>

                            <p>298. Have just received call from member of Marshal Badoglio’s staff

                            <p>311. My 298, May 6, 11 a.m. After I had read the note, the official
                                who brought it, a Captain Alessandrini, told me that he was really a
                                First Secretary in the Italian Diplomatic Service but had been
                                temporarily detached to serve on the High Commissioner’s staff. He
                                also referred to the fact that Marshal Badoglio had at one time been
                                Ambassador in Rio and implied that they were therefore both versed
                                in diplomatic usage. He said he had been instructed to add orally
                                that the High Commissioner would appreciate it very much if the
                                legations would cooperate with him as much as possible “in order
                                that it need not be necessary to curtail their privileges”.</p>
                            <p>I offered no comment on the contents of the note or his verbal
                                communication other than to say that the note would at once be
                                referred to my Government and that I was personally quite prepared
                                to cooperate with the Italian authorities for the protection of
                                American citizens and property and the maintenance of order.</p>
                            <p>Diplomatic Corps met today to discuss note and further steps. Much to
                                our surprise the German Chargé informed us that he not only had
                                already replied but had called on Chief of Cabinet who presented him
                                to the Marshal. He read to us text of his reply which I thought was
                                couched in unnecessarily cordial terms. My other colleagues decided:
                                (1) to await instructions before even acknowledging the note; (2) to
                                call individually and informally on the Chief of Cabinet (who is
                                incidentally the Marshal’s son); and (3) not to ask to see the
                                Marshal, but if his son or another official should offer to
                                introduce us, to accept. I personally do not consider (2) and (3) a
                                particularly dignified procedure but as it does not seem of vital
                                importance I agreed.</p>
                            <p>Belgian Minister Phardean informed us that when Alessandrini called
                                he explained that the Marshal, by virtue of his rank as High
                                Commissioner, would not make first call on the Ministers. The
                                Captain also added an amusing and possibly significant touch by
                                stating that he had been instructed to deliver the note to the
                                “non-sanctionist legations” first and he appears to have begun with
                                the German.</p>

                                instructions from his Government, the French Ambassador called today
                                to inform this Government that the French Minister at Addis Ababa
                                had been instructed to call in the “capacity of an official without
                                diplomatic character” upon the Italian Marshal (1) “to express the
                                wish to thank the Marshal for the help given by Italian troops to
                                the French Legation” and (2) in order to “put himself in a situation
                                to concert with the Marshal for the protection of French interests
                                under his charge”.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador also stated that on May 6 the French Ambassador in
                                Rome had called personally on Mussolini to express the thanks of the
                                French Government “for the quickness with which the Italian troops
                                came to the protection of menaced legations in Addis Ababa”.</p>

                            <p>327. Department’s 209, May 9, 2 p.m. I have just received note dated
                                yesterday from the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps informing me that
                                inasmuch as the French Minister had been known to call on Marshal
                                Badoglio he (the Belgian Minister) would also request to be
                                received.</p>
                            <p>Unless I am instructed to the contrary I shall therefore likewise
                                make an appointment to call upon the High Commander.</p>
                            <p>Since the Italian occupation I have been careful to act on the
                                assumption that the functions of the Legation and Consulate General
                                will continue as normally as the altered physical circumstances
                                permit. I feel that the fewer questions of principle are raised the
                                easier will be the practical solution of any difficulties that might
                                arise. We shall be scrupulously correct and polite in our relations
                                with the Italian authorities and shall yield only in matters of
                                little or no importance or of course upon instructions from the
                                Department. In this manner I hope to afford the fullest possible
                                protection to American interests while avoiding all unnecessary
                                friction with the authorities.</p>
                            <p>What reply shall I make to the note referred to in the Legation’s
                                telegram No. 298, May 6?</p>

                                with the Italian military authorities for the protection of American

                            <p>342. Called on Marshal Badoglio by appointment at 5 p.m. and had
                                pleasant informal chat with him. He opened the conversation by
                                asking how long I had been here and when I told him 10 months he
                                laughed and said “that is a long time and I am sure you are tired of
                                the place and ready to leave soon”. I assured him that I liked it
                                here very much and was not at all tired of it.</p>
                            <p>He then referred in cordial terms to his visit to the United States
                                when he had the pleasure of meeting the President who was then
                                Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He also spoke of his “dear friend
                                General Pershing.”</p>
                            <p>I told the Marshal that I felt somewhat uneasy regarding the safety
                                of Americans in the interior and he promised that as soon as
                                possible he would try and establish communications with the southern
                                provinces. This is to be Graziani’s task when he arrives here. I
                                left with the Marshal’s son a list of our missionaries and their
                                stations.</p>

                            <p>372. On the night of May 20 chief radioman Tanner entered a bar where
                                several Italian officers including a general were being served. They
                                ordered him in English to take his hat off and when he paid no
                                attention they rushed at him, threw him out and had him arrested.
                                They did not know who he was and he was held incommunicado at the
                                police station until the following afternoon and was released when
                                he told an Italian captain that if he had unintentionally insulted
                                an officer he was sorry.</p>

                                other foreigners must give Fascist salute to Governor General who is
                                acting Viceroy, to Italian flag, or Fascist emblem. Anybody in a car
                                must stop and get out or if on horseback must dismount. Failure to
                                comply is to be severely punished.</p>

                                residing in Italy or Germany are expected to give respective
                                national saltites. There would, of course, be no objection to
                                removing hats when passing national or regimental colors or, as a
                                matter of courtesy, even to Governor General but unless instructed
                                to the contrary I shall not advise Americans to give Fascist salute.
                                In any event I and my American staff have no intention of making any
                                Roman obeisances.</p>

                            <p>254. Your 376, May 27, 2 p.m. and 377, May 27, 3 p.m. Pending further
                                consideration of the matter the Department has no objection to your
                                following procedure outlined in your 377. Please advise the
                                Department promptly of the result of your proposed conference with
                                your colleagues on this matter as well as any instructions which
                                your colleagues may have sought or received. The question of
                                foreigners giving Nazi salute was covered by a notice published in
                                the German press on August 23, 1933, by the representative of the
                                leader of the Nazi party. This notice reads as follows: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“In all countries it is the custom that when the national
                                        anthem is sung, when the flag is saluted, or on similar
                                        occasions, foreigners do honor to the country whose
                                        hospitality they enjoy by joining with the citizens of the
                                        country, by standing up, and by taking off their hats. This
                                        is a self-evident obligation of international courtesy, the
                                        fulfillment of which is expected from every German in
                                        foreign countries as it is expected from every foreigner in
                                        Germany. But it cannot be expected that a foreigner should
                                        give a salute or perform a ceremony which is not customary
                                        in his own country as for example the ‘German greeting’
                                        through the lifting of the right arm. This can be expected
                                        as little as for example it cannot be expected of a
                                        Protestant, when he enters a Catholic church, that he cross
                                        himself.”</p>

                            <p>256. Department’s 254, May 28, 6 p.m. Following is text of telegram
                                181, May 29, 3 p.m., from Embassy at Rome: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“In so far as I am aware there is no regulation requiring
                                        foreigners in Italy to give the Fascist salute and certainly
                                        it is not the practice of members of this Embassy or of
                                        other Americans to give that salute on any occasion. In
                                        accordance with the usual custom, however, civilians both
                                        native and foreign uncover when the flag of the country or
                                        the colors of military organizations pass or when the
                                        national anthems’ are played.</p>
                                    <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0357"/>
                                    <p>As regards the official notice issued by the Governor of
                                        Addis Ababa, there has been no reference here of any such
                                        observance being required of foreigners in Ethiopia. The
                                        inclination is to connect this order with the controversy
                                        which is said to be in process between the British and
                                        Italian Governments over the withdrawal of the British
                                        Legation guard at Addis Ababa or it might be regarded as an
                                        indication of an intent to render the position of foreign
                                        officials in Addis Ababa, and possibly of their nationals
                                        untenable in their present status. If such is not the case,
                                        however, it would seem that in so far as Americans are
                                        concerned an explanation to the Italian officials of the
                                        procedure customarily observed by Americans, particularly in
                                        Italy, might result in obviating the complications which
                                        might follow from the enforcement of the order.”</p>

                            <p>The Department is inclined to believe that the situation can probably
                                best be met by adopting the suggestion outlined in the final
                                sentence of the above quoted telegram, but before giving you
                                definite instructions it will await the report of the results of

                            <p>389. My 372, May 26. An Italian major called yesterday afternoon and
                                said he had been sent by Marshal Graziani to deliver a written order
                                for Tanner’s expulsion. He added that it had at first been intended
                                to notify Tanner direct, but that “As a matter of courtesy to the
                                American Minister,” the Marshal decided to deliver it through
                                me.</p>
                            <p>I informed the major that I considered this an extremely grave step
                                and that I could not accept an order for the expulsion of any member
                                of my staff. I told him that “as a matter of courtesy to the
                                Marshal,” I had refrained from making an official complaint
                                regarding Tanner’s detention, his brutal treatment, and the fact
                                that he was not permitted to communicate with me. I added that no
                                one deplored the incident more than I did, and that by way of
                                disciplinary action for whatever share Tanner may have had in it, I
                                had forbidden him to leave the Legation since then. Moreover, I
                                understood that Tanner had orally apologized to an Italian captain
                                just prior to his liberation. I then requested the major to present
                                my compliments to the Marshal and to state that in view of the above
                                considerations I hoped he would agree with me that it would be far
                                preferable if we considered the incident as closed. I could only
                                foresee endless annoyance <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0358"
                                />to both of us if we permitted a relatively uninteresting row in a
                                public bar to degenerate into an international argumentation.</p>
                            <p>The major promised to convey my message and 2 hours later returned to
                                inform me that “as a further indication of Italian good will towards
                                the American Legation and Government” the Marshal had consented to
                                cancel the expulsion order. However, as he had never been informed
                                of Tanner’s oral apology, he inquired if I would be willing to have
                                Tanner put it in writing. To this I agreed, and in a personal letter
                                to the major on blank paper and without any indication of his
                                connection with the Legation, I instructed Tanner to say, “If I have
                                unintentionally insulted an Italian officer I wish to express my
                                regrets.”</p>
                            <p>Considering the special circumstances of the case and the precarious
                                situation of all legations here, I feel this was by far the simplest
                                way of preventing an unpleasant controversy.</p>

                                regular meeting of the Diplomatic Corps this morning. British and
                                French Ambassadors in Rome having protested against the decree they
                                were assured that authorities here would be instructed not to
                                enforce it as regards foreigners. This appears to have been done for
                                although the decree has not been repealed or modified no attempt has
                                been made to apply its provisions to foreigners.</p>

                            <p>403. Legation’s 399, June 6. Marshal Graziani received me yesterday
                                with the utmost courtesy and began by apologizing if he had in any
                                way seemed discourteous to the diplomatic missions. He explained
                                that his instructions had been extremely vague as to his relations
                                with Diplomatic Corps and he implied that Badoglio had not informed
                                him of the arrangements that had already been made in that
                                direction. But he said he was very anxious to remedy any
                                misunderstandings that may have arisen and hoped I would let him
                                know if he could be of service.</p>
                            <p>I replied, half in jest, that inasmuch as neither he nor I were
                                called upon to make any decisions which would bind our respective
                                Governments as regards the future of Ethiopia, I saw no reason why
                                we should not have a perfectly friendly working agreement to deal
                                with problems as they arose and to enable me to look after American
                                interests. To this he readily assented.</p>
                            <p>I then told him how many American citizens we had and he seemed
                                surprised at the relatively large number. I reiterated the remarks I
                                had made to Marshal Badoglio (see last paragraph of Legation’s 342,
                                May 14) regarding our missionaries in the interior but added that I
                                was more anxious than ever to obtain news of their welfare.
                                Incidentally, Graziani and his Chief of Cabinet said they never saw
                                the list I had handed to Badoglio’s son. I am giving him a new list
                                and shall indicate on a map the locations of their stations. The
                                Marshal then agreed to send planes over the principal stations and
                                to drop messages from me but apparently he cannot let them land
                                anywhere nor is he prepared to send any troops.</p>
                            <p>The inescapable impression obtained from the entire interview was
                                that Graziani must have received very definite instructions from
                                Rome to be polite and decent to the foreign legations and perhaps
                                particularly so to the American Legation. Otherwise his sudden <hi

                            <p>270. Your 403, June 7, 1 p.m. Department approves of attitude which
                                you adopted in your conversation with Marshal Graziani and, inasmuch
                                as the question raised in your 399, June 6, 3 p.m., now seems to
                                have been satisfactorily adjusted there would appear to be no need
                                for specific instructions. For your general guidance, however, I
                                make the following comments and suggestions:</p>
                            <p>Since your primary function is to protect American interests in
                                Ethiopia it is of course desirable for you to maintain such friendly
                                informal relations with the Italian authorities as will accomplish
                                that purpose. Accordingly the Department is not inclined to attach
                                undue importance to questions of procedure such as the failure of
                                the Italian authorities to address chiefs of mission without giving
                                them their titles.</p>
                            <p>In this general connection it may be observed that American consular
                                officers in Manchukuo generally refrain from using the titles of
                                local officials in addressing them. The Department has suggested to
                                consular officers in Manchukuo that it would be desirable to avoid
                                formal communication and endeavor to transact business on a personal
                                and/or informal basis.<note n="53" xml:id="d348fn53">See telegram

                            <p>418. Last paragraph Department’s 270, June 9. None of the chiefs of
                                mission here used the title of “Viceroy” in addressing Badoglio.
                                Graziani has never called himself even Acting Viceroy but only
                                Governor General ad interim. I have been careful to refer to him
                                befittingly as “Commander in Chief” thus taking cognizance of his
                                presence merely as the highest authority in military occupation and
                                in no sense implying recognition of Italian sovereignty.</p>

                            <p>453. I am officially informed today that Marshal Graziani pursuant to
                                instructions from Rome has issued a decree which becomes effective
                                tomorrow regulating private radio stations. The Marshal has just
                                told me very courteously that the Legations now possessing radio
                                stations will be permitted to use them provisionally not as
                                Legations but as private individuals and will be subject to such
                                regulations as he may prescribe. He said this would include
                                restrictions regarding certain hours, wave lengths, et cetera, but
                                for the present we would be permitted to send messages in cipher as
                                before.</p>

                            <p>454. Background to my 453 of today is as follows: At about 3 o’clock
                                this afternoon two Italian officers and four <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Carabinièri</hi> arrived at the Legation and said they had
                                verbal orders from the Marshal to close the radio station. They
                                placed a guard in front of the door and prevented our radiomen from
                                entering. As a brief conversation I had with the officers showed
                                that their orders were explicit and they had no discretion, I
                                immediately called on Marshal Graziani and told him that, without
                                discussing the question of the wireless, I could not permit him to
                                send soldiers or police into the Legation compound and to occupy any
                                building therein without my previous consent. I felt, therefore,
                                obliged to request him very emphatically to withdraw the guard at
                                once.</p>
                            <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0362"/>
                            <p>The Marshal replied that he had received instructions from Rome that
                                the Legations should no longer be recognized <hi rend="italic">lex
                                    loci</hi> and that he therefore had a right to treat Legation
                                premises as private dwellings. I denied this and referred him to
                                Marshal Badoglio’s note of May 6<note n="54" xml:id="d352fn54">See
                                    telegram No. 298, May 6, 11 a.m., from the Minister Resident in
                                    Ethiopia, <ref target="#pg_286">p. 286</ref>.</note> which I
                                considered still in force. He said that the situation had changed
                                since then because Ethiopia had been annexed and in any event his
                                orders were now clear on the subject.</p>
                            <p>I then thought it best not to pursue this argument for the moment and
                                asked him why he had suddenly decided to close radio stations
                                belonging to Legations. He replied with great heat that he had been
                                told by his Government that distorted and even entirely false
                                reports regarding the situation were being spread by various
                                Legation radios and although he did not mention any by name it was
                                obvious from his remarks that he had the British and French
                                Legations in mind. He even went so far as to say that certain rumors
                                were being maliciously and systematically concocted locally in order
                                to alarm the population and that he was determined to put a stop to
                                it. I assured the Marshal that this Legation had had nothing
                                whatever to do with the spreading of false reports either locally or
                                by radio but that he had doubtless been in the city long enough to
                                realize how even the most absurd bazaar rumors were seized upon and
                                circulated by both natives and foreigners simply for lack of other
                                news. I suggested that perhaps the best protection against false
                                reports was telling people the truth in so far as military
                                exigencies permitted. I added that since the Italian occupation even
                                the Legations had been left completely in the dark as to what was
                                going on and when we applied to Italian sources for perfectly
                                legitimate information we only received evasive answers.</p>
                            <p>The Marshal admitted the justice of some of my remarks but explained
                                that he had heavy responsibilities on his shoulders and was
                                therefore obliged to use extreme caution. He admitted frankly that
                                there were still some elements in the situation which caused him
                                anxiety but nothing was to be gained by exaggerating the dangers,
                                and he therefore hoped the Legations would not render his task more
                                difficult by obliging drastic action. I laughed and said I
                                considered his action in forcibly seizing my radio station
                                sufficiently drastic.</p>
                            <p>As our interview had already lasted nearly an hour and we were not
                                getting anywhere I asked him if he would allow me to suggest to him
                                the following compromise solution to our present impasse: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>The Italian soldiers to be withdrawn from the Legation
                                        premises tonight and not to return.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>Radio station to continue to function as hitherto for the
                                        entire 24 hours during which I would inform my Government of
                                        his wishes.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>In return for the above I would recommend to my Government
                                            <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0363"/>that it
                                        authorize me to accept any reasonable regulations for radio
                                        stations which he might consider it necessary to promulgate
                                        in view of the military situation, provided of course that
                                        such regulations were applicable to radio stations of all
                                        legations.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>The Marshal was inclined to haggle and said he would take away the
                                guard if I gave him my word that the wireless would not be used.
                                This afforded me a chance to say that if Washington did not hear
                                from me tonight they would probably think we had all been massacred
                                and that would be worse than any inaccurate reports we could have
                                possibly sent out. The thought came as a distinct shock to Graziani
                                and turning to a colonel who was in the room he said: “I never
                                thought of that. I suppose it is true that if all the legation
                                radios suddenly ceased transmitting without explanation their
                                Governments would fear something terrible had happened”. He at once
                                telephoned to recall his pickets from the American and other
                                Legations and to inform the latter of the temporary arrangement. The
                                Italian soldiers left our Legation at about 9 p.m.</p>
                            <p>As we are at best only [apparent omission] from hand to mouth here
                                and I have been fully expecting the Italians ever since their
                                arrival to insist that our radio stations be closed, I trust the
                                above meets with the Department’s approval. We have at least upheld
                                our diplomatic immunity and it may be an advantage to have even a
                                limited use of our own radio so long as this Legation is
                                functioning, for the Italian commercial wireless is still most
                                unreliable and excessively slow.</p>

                            <p>461. I have received a written order from His Excellency, Marshal
                                Graziani, that in view of the situation which has developed since my
                                interview with him, he finds himself obliged to close for a period
                                of <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0364"/>15 days the radio
                                stations of the four Legations possessing them. I have complied with
                                his request but have obtained authorization to continue to receive
                                messages. Beginning today I shall therefore send my messages via
                                Italian radio.</p>

                            <p>466. Legation’s 461, July 8, 5 p.m. French and German radios were
                                sealed July 8th. British Legation Guard refused to admit Italian
                                officers and men to the radio station and would have used force had
                                the Italians insisted. British Chargé d’Affaires asked for
                                instructions and today received reply to offer his word of honor to
                                the Marshal not to transmit messages but if not accepted to permit

                            <p>The British Ambassador at Rome has been instructed to urge
                                immediately the despatch of orders to the Italian authorities in
                                Ethiopia with a view to assuring the full immunity of the Legation

                                contention repeatedly put forward by the Italian Government that the

                            <p>His Majesty’s Government earnestly hope that the United States

                            <p>83. On July 6 two Italian officers and four <hi rend="italic"
                                    >carabinièri</hi> entered the Legation at Addis Ababa and
                                announced they had verbal orders to close the Legation radio. The
                                Minister Resident immediately sought an interview with Graziani and,
                                after stating he could not permit soldiers or police in the Legation
                                compound without his previous consent, urged the Marshal to withdraw
                                his troops at once. Following lengthy discussion Graziani gave
                                orders to withdraw troops and agreed to permit Legations, not as
                                Legations but as individuals, provisionally to use radios, subject
                                however to certain restrictions regarding hours, wave lengths, et
                                cetera.</p>
                            <p>On July 8 Engert received written order from Graziani that, in view
                                of situation which had developed since above interview, it was
                                necessary to close Legation radio stations for a period of 15 days.
                                Engert subsequently obtained authority to receive messages, but he
                                is sending via commercial radio.</p>
                            <p>Please take this matter up at once with Foreign Office and urge that
                                instructions be sent to military authorities in East Africa with a
                                view to insuring the immunity of the American Legation in practice
                                without discussion of its diplomatic status. Also urge desirability
                                of permitting two-way communication by code between Legation radio
                                station and Washington subject if necessary to reasonable
                                restrictions regarding hours of use. If authorities decline to
                                permit stations to function at this time you should endeavor to
                                induce them to permit stations to reopen at end of 15-day period
                                referred to above.</p>
                            <p>Report results of your representations.</p>
                            <p>The military situation at Addis Ababa is such that the Department
                                deems open communication of the utmost importance and wishes you to
                                use your best endeavors to effect a satisfactory solution.</p>

                            <p>304. Your 461, July 8, 5 p.m. The Chargé d’Affaires at Rome has been
                                instructed to bring this whole matter to the attention of the
                                Foreign Office and to urge that orders be sent to the military
                                authorities in East Africa with a view to insuring the immunity of
                                the Legation in practice without discussion of its diplomatic
                                status. The Chargé d’Affaires has also been directed to urge the
                                desirability of permitting two-way communication by code between
                                Legation radio station and Washington, subject if necessary to
                                reasonable restrictions regarding hours of use.</p>
                            <p>Please consult with your colleagues who have been placed in a similar
                                position and endeavor to arrive at a common understanding respecting
                                approach to the Italian authorities in this matter. It would be
                                desirable if all the Legations affected would do their utmost to
                                induce the Italian authorities to forego their claim to prohibiting
                                the use of the Legation radio stations. If those authorities persist
                                in their view, however, acquiescence will probably be necessary in
                                view of their position of military occupation. If Italian
                                authorities decline to permit reopening of the radio stations at
                                this time it might be possible to induce them to permit them again
                                to function after the end of present 15-day period.</p>
                            <p>If you are obliged to continue to send messages by commercial radio
                                you should endeavor to obtain full assurance that code communication
                                will be permitted.</p>
                            <p>If Italian authorities again attempt to invade the Legation by force
                                you should protest vigorously and report fully to the
                                Department.</p>

                            <p>261. Department’s 83, July 10, 4 p.m. I discussed this matter with
                                the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning and urged that
                                instructions be issued as outlined in paragraph 3 of the telegram
                                referred to above. Ciano said that it would be necessary for him to
                                consult with the Minister for Colonies and that he would communicate
                                with me as soon as possible. As regards the use of the radio he said
                                that whatever measures had been taken were in no way directed
                                against <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0367"/>the American
                                Legation and that he could see no objection on principle to radio
                                communication between the Legation and Washington but that he had
                                heard that other radio stations in Addis Ababa had been used for
                                “broadcasting” to points in Ethiopia where Italian forces had not
                                yet established actual control and that presumably it was necessary
                                to take some action to prevent such use of foreign radios.</p>
                            <p>In this connection the <hi rend="italic">Tribuna</hi> reports from
                                Addis Ababa that “responsible foreign circles” there are using every
                                means to spread false reports and that they have been warned to
                                desist.</p>

                                23, when the 15 days expire, further representations should be made
                                in Rome rather than here. We shall, of course, as in the past,
                                continue to maintain correct personal relations with the Marshal in

                                a further inquiry on my part tells me that the Italian authorities
                                are trying to arrive at some working arrangement as regards the

                                him as regards their Legations and that Graziani is discussing the

                                Ababa and that they had been found necessary in view of the use
                                which had been made of certain foreign radio stations there and
                                which the Italians regarded as irregular.</p>

                                        Marshal Graziani dated July 21 to the effect that inasmuch

                                        still exist, no exception can be made to the rule that

                                        Government which will only be granted if code book is

                            <p>If you ascertain that the article in question is intended to apply to

                                that this Government cannot admit the right of the Italian
                                authorities to interfere with communications with its representative
                                at Addis Ababa. This Government therefore urgently requests that
                                early steps be taken by the Italian Government to bring about the
                                amendment of the decree of July 21, so as to permit unrestricted
                                communication between this Government and its representative at
                                Addis Ababa.</p>

                            <p>290. Department’s 93, July 24, 4 p.m. I have just called at the
                                Foreign Office and requested a clarification of Graziani’s decree of
                                July 21. I was informed that an inquiry would be immediately
                                addressed to the Ministry of Colonies and that a reply might be
                                expected within 2 or 3 days.</p>
                            <p>The British Embassy here has been notified of this decree but as yet

                                of codes by the American Legation in communicating with

                                Graziani. It seems unlikely, however, that the matter can be kept
                                confidential since your 493 was sent <hi rend="italic">en clair</hi>
                                before you were advised that similar arrangements had not been made
                                for the other legations. Furthermore, it is altogether probable that
                                your code messages sent via radio will be picked up by parties for
                                whom they are not intended and the fact will soon become known that
                                you are sending in code.</p>
                            <p>Undoubtedly Marshal Graziani foresaw these possibilities and decided
                                to accord us exclusive privileges on the ground that the United
                                States is not concerned in the European aspects of the
                                Italo-Ethiopian situation. Obviously the nature of American
                                interests in Ethiopia sets this country apart from European Powers
                                and furnishes a reasonable justification for according us a
                                confidential means of communication not necessarily granted at this
                                time to those Powers.</p>
                            <p>It is to be hoped that if the situation becomes known (as it surely
                                must) to the other interested Powers they will refrain from using
                                our case as a basis for demanding similar treatment. If the
                                privilege of communicating in code were withdrawn from your Legation
                                the action could not possibly benefit the other legations. On the
                                contrary, they might in case of emergency suffer because of your
                                lack of a confidential means of communication.</p>
                            <p>You may make discreet use of the foregoing in any discussions which
                                you may find it necessary to have in this matter.</p>

                            <p>During a call from the British Ambassador this afternoon I conveyed
                                to him, at the Secretary’s suggestion, a full account of the most
                                recent developments respecting the use of the legation radios in
                                Addis Ababa and requested him in advance to ask his Government to
                                regard this information as strictly confidential for the time being
                                and not to be used in any manner that would be detrimental to the
                                interests of this Government.</p>
                            <p>I explained to the Ambassador that after the order of July 8
                                suspending for a period of two weeks the use of the legation radios
                                for transmitting purposes we had made strong representations in Rome
                                along the lines of those made by the other interested Powers. I
                                recalled to him furthermore that I had shown him the text of the
                                strong protest we had made to the Italian Government over the decree
                                issued by Marshal Graziani on July 21 abolishing the right of the
                                legations at Addis Ababa to send messages to their governments in
                                code. The point I wished to make to the Ambassador was that we had
                                at no time requested nor expected any exceptional treatment in this
                                matter at the hands of the Italians.</p>
                            <p>In a telegram sent by Engert <hi rend="italic">en clair</hi>
                                yesterday morning at eight o’clock we were informed that Marshal
                                Graziani had advised Mr. Engert that there would be no objection to
                                his transmitting messages to his Government in code. Only at four
                                o’clock yesterday afternoon did Mr. Engert learn that this privilege
                                was to be granted exclusively to him and was not to be accorded to
                                other foreign representatives in Addis Ababa.</p>
                            <p>I told the Ambassador that I had discussed this matter with the
                                Secretary and was instructed to inform Sir Ronald that this
                                Government, in accordance with its past practice, desired to deal in
                                all frankness with the British Government. The Secretary desired me
                                to point out that under the unusual circumstances now prevailing it
                                could serve no useful purpose for the British Government to invoke
                                Marshal Graziani’s special favor to Mr. Engert as a means of
                                obtaining a like privilege for the British representative in Addis
                                Ababa. On the contrary, we were convinced that any such effort would
                                merely result in depriving Mr. Engert of the use of code messages
                                without affecting in any way the present ban on the use of code
                                messages by European representatives in Ethiopia. Such being the
                                case, I wished to reemphasize the Secretary’s desire that the
                                information I had conveyed <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0373"
                                />to the Ambassador on this subject not be utilized in any
                                representations on this subject to the Italian Government nor
                                employed in any manner that might affect the interests of this
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>I explained furthermore to the Ambassador our view that it would be
                                far better for all concerned, including particularly the British, to
                                see maintained the recently accorded code privilege to Mr. Engert. I
                                assured the Ambassador, in accordance with the Secretary’s
                                suggestion, that we should be only too glad to furnish him in
                                confidence any information received henceforth from Mr. Engert that
                                might be of particular concern to the British Government. I also
                                pointed out that in case of any unexpected emergency requiring
                                urgent communication between the British Chargé d’Affaires in Addis
                                Ababa and his Government Mr. Engert would stand ready to assist the
                                British Chargé in any practicable way.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador thanked me profusely for acquainting him with this
                                situation and said he concurred wholeheartedly in the Department’s
                                viewpoint and would so state in communicating the information in
                                confidence to his Government.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador went on to say that he fully expected a “first-class
                                massacre” in Addis Ababa in the not too distant future. He said one
                                only had to recall the experiences of the Italians in subduing Libya
                                to realize that they were given to such drastic action in times of
                                near panic. It was the Latin way of doing things, he said, to resort
                                to massacre in order to impress native populations with the
                                authority of Borne.</p>

                            <p>507. Following is background to my 489, July 25th<note n="63"
                                    xml:id="d372fn63">See telegram No. 95, July 27, 10 p.m., to the
                                    Chargé in Italy, <ref target="#pg_305">p. 305</ref>.</note> and
                                493, July 28th. The Marshal sent for me and told me rather naively
                                that he <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0374"/>had just received
                                instructions from the Duce himself to maintain cordial relations
                                with the American Legation because the Italian Government was
                                animated by the most friendly sentiments towards the United States.
                                He added that Count Ciano wished his personal greetings conveyed to
                                me as he had pleasant recollections of our associations in China and
                                wanted to assure me that none of the recent measures regarding radio
                                stations and ciphers was at any time directed against me or the
                                American Legation. There were, however, he said “certain Legations
                                which you know and I need not mention” whose discretion and
                                impartiality the Italian Government did not trust and therefore
                                wished to prevent from broadcasting fanciful and spurious news to
                                the detriment of Italian interests.</p>
                            <p>I thanked the Marshal for his frankness and requested him to remember
                                me very cordially to Count Ciano. I then said that I felt the best
                                proof of friendly feelings would be if he restored to me the right
                                to use my codes in communication with Washington. He replied that he
                                personally saw no objection and in my presence gave instructions
                                that recommendations in that sense be telegraphed to Rome. I assume
                                the message I mentioned in my 493, July 28, 8 a.m., was the result
                                of his suggestion to the Italian Government.</p>
                            <p>In the course of our conversation Graziani also referred to his
                                speech from which certain passages were quoted in my 487, July
                                    24th<note n="64" xml:id="d372fn64">Not printed.</note> and
                                stated that circumstances obliged him to use such surplus language

                                foreigners. This remark and the way he said it left me with the
                                distinct impression that Rome had read my 487 which was <hi

                                that his references to foreign interests and intrigues, et cetera,
                                would not be interpreted as including the United States.</p>

                            <p>551. Yesterday at 1:30 p.m. while my family and I were at luncheon,
                                nine Ethiopians whom the Italians are pleased to call “rebels” were
                                publicly executed by a firing squad directly in front of the
                                Legation and less than a hundred yards from one of our gates.</p>
                            <p>In a personal letter to Marshal Graziani I have protested against
                                this outrage as showing “complete disregard of the most elementary
                                feelings of decency and propriety” and have requested that the
                                officer responsible for the selection of the place of execution be
                                severely reprimanded. I added that I would not in future tolerate
                                the perpetration of such horrors at the Legation’s doorsteps.</p>
                            <p>I shall telegraph as soon as I receive a reply.</p>

                            <p>554. My 551, September 13, 9 a.m. Marshal Graziani sent his principal
                                assistant, Colonel Mazzi, to the Legation this morning with
                                instructions to extend to me the Marshal’s most profound apologies
                                for the occurrence which he deplored more than he could say. The
                                Marshal had no idea where these executions were to take place or he
                                would not have permitted them. He had not only reprimanded the
                                responsible officer but had punished him and he wished to assure me
                                that I should never again have occasion to complain of such lack of
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>Even before the Colonel arrived, the Italian military had begun to
                                dig up the bodies which had been buried where they had fallen and
                                whose removal I had very peremptorily demanded in my letter.</p>
                            <p>So far as I am concerned the incident is closed. Ghastly though it
                                was, I am glad it afforded me an opportunity to tell the Marshal
                                what truly civilized people think of such methods. The Department
                                will <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0376"/>see from my letter, a
                                copy of which is being mailed,<note n="65" xml:id="d375fn65">Not
                                    printed.</note> that I did not mince matters and I gather from
                                Mazzi’s conversation the above has had the sobering effect on them
                                all, which I hoped it would have.</p>

                            <p>353. Your 551, September 13, 9 a.m. While it is of course regrettable
                                that the Italian authorities should have chosen a spot so near our
                                legation to carry out the execution of rebels, I am surprised that
                                you have seen fit without consulting me to address a written protest
                                to Marshal Graziani couched in such violent language.</p>
                            <p>If any action appeared desirable before consulting the Department it
                                would seem that you might have confined yourself in the first
                                instance to a courteous oral inquiry of the Marshal as to the
                                reasons why the executions were carried out so near the Legation. In
                                view of the friendly spirit which the Marshal has repeatedly shown
                                in matters of concern to this Government I cannot believe he would
                                have failed in the present instance to have given sympathetic
                                consideration to any reasonable request you might have made.</p>
                            <p>I note that in your letter to the Marshal you have stated that you
                                “will not in the future tolerate the perpetration of such horrors at
                                the Legation’s doorsteps.” The impropriety of such a threat should
                                be obvious to you in the absence of any knowledge that the
                                Department concurred in the step you have taken and would be
                                prepared to support you in making any such an unenforceable
                                demand.</p>
                            <p>You should bear constantly in mind the delicate position of our
                                diplomatic mission in Ethiopia and the fact of Italian military
                                control and you should carefully refrain from any act that might
                                aggravate the situation, and create needless problems for the
                                Department.</p>

                            <p>557. The Department doubtless received my 554, September 14, 1 a.m.
                                    [<hi rend="italic">p.m.</hi>] shortly after its 353, September

                            <p>I regret very much that the tone of my letter to Marshal Graziani <pb
                                    n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0377"/>caused you anxiety and I
                                need hardly assure you that only the most exceptional circumstances
                                seem to warrant it. As indicated in my 551, I had been careful to
                                mark it “personal” but was fully conscious of its unusual nature and
                                therefore wished the Department to know the most salient statements
                                it contained. As on many occasions in the past, several of which I
                                never even reported, I was anxious to avoid involving the Department
                                officially. The Marshal was, of course, aware that I was not acting
                                under instructions but was merely giving vent to personal feelings
                                which had been outraged.</p>
                            <p>Even so I should have hesitated to send him the letter had not my
                                relations with him been such that I felt almost certain he would
                                understand and even that he has appreciated it. He has been
                                extremely rude to some of my diplomatic colleagues—notably the
                                French Minister—and has treated me comparatively decently only
                                because he realized from the very beginning that I would not permit
                                him to bully me. He is a bluff soldier and quite impervious to
                                diplomatic niceties but I have so far always found him responsive to
                                frankness and fair comments. I admit, of course, it would have been
                                safer to take the matter up orally but I was frankly too shocked by
                                the occurrence to be able to discuss it with any degree of calmness.
                                I had said nothing when Bishop Petros was executed only about a
                                quarter of a mile from the Legation and I now felt it was high time
                                something was done about these public executions at odd street
                                corners.</p>
                            <p>As I anticipated the Marshal saw at once that unnecessary offense had
                                been caused not only to the Legation but to my family and myself
                                personally and was ready to make amends. Colonel Mazzi told me the
                                Marshal was so upset by my letter that he could not eat his dinner
                                and again and again referred to the incident as “inexcusable
                                stupidity”.</p>
                            <p>I shall soon call on Graziani on some other business and shall give
                                him to understand how much I appreciate his courteous attitude
                                toward the Legation.</p>

                            <p>44. My 398, June 6, 1936. The Italian Governor of Addis Ababa called
                                this morning and requested me to instruct American nationals to
                                comply with the provisions of the municipal ordinance. I replied
                                that I had already 9 months ago advised American citizens to uncover
                                in the normal American manner when meeting the Marshal or passing
                                Italian national or regimental colors and I believed they had done
                                so. <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0378"/>The Governor then
                                pointed out that the ordinance required that persons on horseback
                                must dismount and if in a car they must get out.</p>
                            <p>I expressed surprise that after these many months an attempt should
                                be made to enforce that particular provision. I said that I had
                                never heard of any similar requirements in any part of the civilized
                                or uncivilized world; that it smacked of medievalism and reminded me
                                of what a Spanish Viceroy of Peru might have required in the
                                sixteenth century; and that I personally considered it frankly too
                                unreasonable to instruct my colony to comply with it without
                                specific instructions from my Government. The Governor then said it
                                had nothing to do with “governments” but only referred to private
                                citizens and there was no desire to apply it to foreign diplomatic
                                or consular officers. I remarked that I had, of course, taken that
                                for granted but that diplomatic and consular horses or mules or even
                                cars were not always readily distinguishable from those belonging to
                                ordinary mortals and that consequently unpleasant incidents would be
                                almost unavoidable. We parted with a promise on my part to refer his
                                request to the Department.</p>
                            <p>The Governor (see Legation’s despatch No. 156, July 8<note n="66"
                                    xml:id="d378fn66">Not printed.</note>) was Chief of Cabinet when
                                Graziani first arrived but was so rude to the British and French
                                Ministers that they virtually insisted on his removal. Since then we
                                have had few contacts with him but he has remained the most
                                objectionable of all the higher officials here (see also my telegram
                                399, June 6, 3 p.m.). I feel personally convinced that the Marshal
                                had little or nothing to do either with the original order or with
                                the present desire to apply it to foreigners. I therefore venture to
                                suggest that a hint in Rome would probably suffice to cause the
                                matter again to be dropped.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime I shall consult with my principal colleagues.</p>

                                that <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0382"/>as far as possible
                                only merchandise of Italian origin would be allowed to enter
                                Ethiopia so that Italy may be reimbursed for the expenses of the
                                war. In the case of American goods, it appears that the Italian
                                authorities have refused to issue the necessary import licenses in
                                certain instances without giving any reason whatsoever, and in other
                                instances the refusal has been based on the congested conditions of
                                the railroad or on the grounds that they were unable to sell dollar
                                exchange.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, the Minister Resident points out that large
                                quantities of Italian goods of every description are commencing to
                                arrive and that it is quite obvious preference is accorded such
                                goods as regards import licenses, permits to ship by or from
                                Djibouti and in the purchase of foreign exchange. The Minister
                                Resident adds that it is his understanding that the confused banking
                                and exchange situation greatly facilitates the arbitrary decisions
                                which discriminate against goods of non-Italian origin.</p>
                            <p>The Department has informed the Minister Resident that it does not
                                desire to raise the general question of obstructions against
                                American trade in Ethiopia at this time, although it has no
                                objection in such individual cases as are brought to his attention
                                for him to endeavor informally to facilitate the entrance of
                                American products by supporting applications for import licenses,
                                shipping permits and allocations for dollar exchange.</p>
                            <p>It is requested that you take up the matter of obstructions to the
                                importation of goods of non-Italian origin into Ethiopia informally
                                with the appropriate French authorities with a view to ascertaining
                                what, if any, action the French Government is taking in order to
                                insure the application of non-discriminatory treatment to French
                                goods imported into Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>As of possible interest in this connection there is enclosed a copy
                                of a despatch of August 20, 1936, from the Consulate General at

                            <p>During a call from the Italian Ambassador<note n="72"
                                    xml:id="d385fn72">Fulvio Suvich.</note> on another matter on
                                October 30, I asked him whether he had any information regarding <pb
                                    n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0383"/>the policy of his
                                Government with respect to foreign trade with Ethiopia. I mentioned
                                that according to our information it had become practically
                                impossible for any non-Italians to do any business with or in
                                Ethiopia. I made reference in this connection to the Italian
                                statement of policy read at the League Assembly on June 30, 1936, in
                                which the Italian Government undertook to accord “fair treatment” to
                                foreign trade with Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>In reply the Ambassador stated that while he was not fully informed
                                on this subject, he did know that the Italian authorities in
                                Ethiopia had pointed to the fact that there are as yet no clearly
                                defined frontiers between Ethiopia proper and the adjoining Italian
                                colonies and that for the time being it is impossible to distinguish
                                between trade with those colonies and Ethiopia proper. In other
                                words, I gathered from the Ambassador’s remarks that, for the time
                                being at least, Ethiopia has been assimilated to the adjoining
                                Italian colonies as far as trade is concerned. The chances,
                                therefore, of any resumption of foreign trade with Ethiopia along
                                the lines existing before the Italian conquest are very slim in the
                                absence of steps by the Italian Government to give effect to the
                                promises made to the League Assembly on June 30, 1936.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador remarked, with a smile, that he was quite familiar
                                with the above-mentioned promises to the Assembly since he himself
                                drafted them and he had purposely used the phrase “fair treatment”
                                in view of the uncertainty of the situation.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of the Department’s instruction No. 9 of October 23, 1936,
                                with regard to the attitude taken by Italian officials in connection
                                with the importation into Ethiopia of foreign goods other than
                                Italian.</p>
                            <p>This matter was taken up informally with the Foreign Office which
                                advised the Embassy that no specific cases have been brought to its
                                attention in which the Italian authorities in Ethiopia had refused
                                to issue a permit for importation into Ethiopia of French goods.
                                However, the Foreign Office understands that the Italian authorities
                                are probably following such a policy and there have been specific
                                instances in which they have refused to grant a visa for agents of
                                French commercial firms to enter Ethiopia. Also, the Italian
                                authorities have, in the case of representatives of French
                                commercial firms residing in Ethiopia who desired to leave the
                                country, refused to <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0384"/>grant
                                them an <hi rend="italic">aller et retour</hi> visa and only granted
                                them one to leave the country. The French Government has made no <hi
                                    rend="italic">démarche</hi> to the Italian Government on this
                                matter.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Office stated that most of the goods at present imported
                                into Ethiopia are for the Italian Army of Occupation and that the
                                facilities of the railway are not great enough to enable them to
                                transport all of the goods necessary for that Army.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Office likewise said that when French commercial firms
                                requested information or advice as to the possibility of trade with
                                Ethiopia, they were discouraged from attempting such trade.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            <p>340. Italian doctor who is director of sanitation called at Seventh
                                Day Adventist Mission this afternoon and informed them that the
                                Italians desired to take over their hospital. He implied that this
                                was not because of a temporary military emergency but the settled
                                policy of his Government. He was informed that the matter was being
                                referred to the Legation.</p>
                            <p>I respectfully suggest that the Department send for L. H. Christian
                                of the General Conference Seventh Day Adventists, Washington, who I
                                understand is thoroughly familiar with the legal aspects of the
                                mission’s tenancy. Contract with the Ethiopian Government shown me
                                still has 16 years to run.</p>
                            <p>Should the Italian military authorities in the meantime attempt to
                                take possession of the hospital I shall of course protest.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that on
                                October 13, 1936, there arrived in Addis Ababa Monsignor Gian Maria
                                Emilio Castellani, Archbishop of Rhodes, in the capacity of
                                Apostolic Visitant for Ethiopia on special mission.</p>
                            <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0385"/>
                            <p>The arrival of this emissary of the Pope is connected with the
                                organization of the activities of the Roman Catholic Church in the
                                new “Empire”. Already several months ago it became known here that
                                the Pope had appointed a committee, consisting of a number of
                                cardinals and other church dignitaries, to study the problems
                                presented by the conquest and “annexation” of Ethiopia. Two phases
                                of the situation are understood to have received special attention,
                                viz (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the ministering to the spiritual
                                needs of the present and future Italian population in East Africa,
                                and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the continuation and extension of
                                missionary activities among the natives.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the white settlers it may be assumed that the system
                                of ecclesiastic hierarchies in vogue in Italy will, as far as
                                practicable, be instituted in Ethiopia. At present there are three
                                Apostolic Vicariates and two Apostolic Prefectures in Ethiopia. The
                                Vicars are titular bishops acting as delegates of the Apostolic See,
                                while the Prefects are priests with similar powers but without
                                episcopal rank. All are under the supervision of the “Sacra
                                Congregatio de Propaganda Fide” in Rome, which is said to be
                                organized as a sort of “Colonial Office” to the Vatican.</p>
                            <p>I understand that in future all of Italian East Africa will be
                                divided into about a dozen vicariates and prefectures, and that the
                                Abyssinian hinterland which hitherto went with the prefecture of
                                Djibouti will be attached to the nearest prefecture in Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>Missionary work is to be carried out chiefly by the religious orders
                                of the Salesians and Capuchins, both of whom have in the past been
                                active in this part of the world. The French Lazarists who have been
                                working in Ethiopia for nearly a century will probably not be
                                permitted to continue. The religious orders are to be assisted by an
                                organization called “Italica Gens” which will interest itself
                                chiefly in the construction of hospitals and schools.</p>
                            <p>It seems certain that in their vision of an Italo-African empire the
                                Church and State in Italy will find it convenient to march side by
                                side. Having made his peace with the Pope the Duce—following the
                                example of France—will be quick to seize every opportunity to use
                                the Church for the strengthening of Italian political influence
                                abroad. From personal observation I know that in Egypt and
                                Palestine, for example, the Italian Government has during the past
                                few years made great efforts to impress the Near East with this
                                alleged powerful partnership between the Latin Church and Fascist
                                Italy. And after the serious setbacks the Roman Catholic Church has
                                recently suffered in Spain and Malta it may be assumed that it will
                                eagerly welcome a chance for expansion elsewhere. As a significant
                                indication of the <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0386"/>spirit
                                animating the collaboration between the spiritual and secular powers
                                in Ethiopia the following utterance by Mgr. Castellani may be
                                quoted: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Italy is the country God has designated to bring to the
                                        world an ever higher civilization which will also redound to
                                        the glory of the Church. That is why God is always on our
                                        side, for he knows that Italy is worthy of assuming such a
                                        lofty mission. It will be the Empire of Rome that will carry
                                        the Cross of the Christ thanks to the stupendous work of the
                                        man with that wonderful personality—the Duce.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>It is as yet too early to speculate upon the effect the preponderant
                                position of the Roman Catholic Church in Ethiopia will have upon
                                American and other Protestant missionary activities. Although
                                Marshal Graziani told a British missionary last June that inasmuch
                                as Italy had proclaimed religious liberty his work could go on,
                                there have been many indications that the Italian authorities are
                                not very friendly disposed towards them. It seems likely that the
                                general attitude of the Roman Church in other parts of the Near
                                East, as well as in the Far East, will also obtain here, namely a
                                spirit of opposition to American and British missionary endeavors
                                not only on the ground that they are heretical, but for political
                                reasons because they are known to have successfully spread
                                Anglo-Saxon culture and the use of the English language.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith
                                a copy of an interesting questionnaire, in Italian and in
                                translation, which Mr. James L. Rohrbaugh recently submitted to the
                                Italian authorities regarding their attitude towards Protestant, and
                                more particularly American, missionary activities in Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rohrbaugh, who was formerly connected with the Sudan Interior
                                Mission and now represents the Independent Presbyterian Board of
                                Foreign Missions, also writes occasionally for the United Press in
                                the United States. However, he assures me that he neither
                                telegraphed nor mailed the contents of the questionnaire to the
                                United Press, but that he did send a copy of it to a religious
                                periodical in the United States which had suggested the idea to
                                him.</p>
                            <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0387"/>
                            <p>As the answers to the questions were only given after several weeks
                                of careful consideration by the highest Italian authorities in this
                                city they may be considered as official. The Department will
                                therefore note with interest the assurances that missionaries who
                                had been obliged to abandon their stations would be permitted to
                                return to them; that they would be free to preach, so long as they
                                confined themselves to religion; and that they could proselytize
                                among the pagans if they wished.</p>
                            <p>The Department’s attention is more especially invited to Question (5)
                                and the answer to it which contains a veiled reference to
                                “nonsanctionist” nations during the recent Italo-Ethiopian war, and
                                which goes so far as to promise that if in future the Italian
                                authorities should find it necessary to discriminate between
                                missionaries of different nationalities, American missionaries would
                                receive more favorable treatment.</p>

                                        Toward Missionary Activities</hi></head>
                                <p>(1) Q. Is it true that the official policy of the Government will
                                    be that missions may continue their work so long as they do not
                                    interfere with the Government or the State?</p>
                                <p>A. Yes, the missions will be permitted to explain their objects,
                                    provided they remain within the limits of their religious
                                    activities and do not act contrary to the laws of the State.</p>
                                <p>(2) Q. Will the missionaries who have abandoned their stations
                                    during the war and disorders be permitted to return to them?</p>
                                <p>A. Yes, provided that in the past they were not engaged in
                                    anti-Italian propaganda, and that their previous places of
                                    residence have not proved unsuited for the carrying out of their
                                    work.</p>
                                <p>(3) Q. Will it be necessary for Protestant missionaries to obtain
                                    permits from the Government in order to preach in Addis Ababa or
                                    in the interior, or will they have complete liberty as was the
                                    case under the old régime?</p>
                                <p>A. Protestant missionaries will be free to preach, provided they
                                    limit themselves strictly to the religious field.</p>
                                <p>(4) Q. Do the official declarations regarding freedom of worship
                                    include the right to effect conversions among the pagan
                                    tribes?</p>
                                <p>A. There is no objection to the missions’ proselytizing among the
                                    pagans.</p>
                                <p>(5) Q. Many people in this city are under the impression that the
                                    Government is more friendly disposed towards American
                                    missionaries than towards those of other nationalities. Is this
                                    true and intentional, <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0388"
                                    />and if so may it be said that it is an indication of
                                    friendship towards America because of the long friendly
                                    relations between the Italian and the American Governments?</p>
                                <p>A. It is a fact that the Italian Government cannot forget those
                                    nations which during the Italo-Ethiopian conflict have been most
                                    benevolent to it.</p>
                                <p>If, in the future, it should be necessary to make any
                                    distinctions between the missionaries of the various countries
                                    it is certain that, as far as possible, those from North America
                                    will be favored.</p>

                            <p>665. I have just learned that the Italian authorities have decided to
                                expropriate the entire Sudan Interior Mission property in Addis
                                Ababa including their leper hospital “for political and sanitary
                                reasons.”</p>
                            <p>I shall confer with my British colleague as the organization is an
                                Anglo-American one but respectfully suggest that the Department
                                inform the mission’s headquarters of the decision and obtain, if
                                possible, an indication of their policy and intentions.</p>
                            <p>Confidentially, I believe this is the entering wedge by means of
                                which the Italian authorities desire to get rid of all American
                                missionary effort in this country.</p>

                                    Governor General of Italian East Africa the requisitioning of
                                    the entire property of the said mission which may even

                                <item>Article 1 states that all buildings whatsoever including
                                    residences of staff and mission headquarters at Akaki and Furi
                                    near Addis Ababa are requisitioned together with their entire

                                    personal belongings of the missionaries. Article 2 provides for
                                    a commission which is to make a list of the requisitioned
                                    properties and in consultation with the mission estimate its
                                    fair value.</item>

                                <item>There are at present 14 American citizens connected with the
                                    Sudan Interior Mission in Addis Ababa alone without counting
                                    those in the provinces. The leprosarium established by the
                                    American mission to lepers in New York is run by the Sudan
                                    Interior Mission on behalf of the American organization but is
                                    not otherwise connected with the Sudan Interior Mission. I
                                    understand that both properties are held under a 30 years
                                    lease.</item>

                                <item>When representatives of the mission requested the Italian
                                    authorities to postpone action until they had had time to
                                    communicate with their home offices they were told that the
                                    decree was now in force and that the Italian commission (see
                                    paragraph 3 above) would proceed with the appraisal of the
                                    properties even without the cooperation of the mission.</item>

                                <item>As I question the legality of the requisition of foreign
                                    property without the slightest pretext of military necessity I
                                    am informing the military authorities that pending instructions
                                    from my Government I reserve all rights on behalf of the
                                    American interests involved. I am also explaining to him the
                                    difference between the leprosarium and the Sudan Interior
                                    Mission. My British colleague is taking similar action on behalf
                                    of his nationals and interests.</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>I am given to understand that the American mission to lepers
                                    might be willing to cede the leprosarium to the Italian
                                    authorities. However, if that is the case I strongly urge that
                                    it be done without reference to the decree and only against full
                                    compensation. I feel that until we have recognized Italian
                                    sovereignty in Ethiopia we cannot consistently recognize the
                                    right of the political as distinguished from the military
                                    authorities to seize American property. For if we do in this
                                    instance I am perfectly certain Italian decrees will soon follow
                                    requisitioning the remaining American institutions and thus
                                    virtually expelling all American citizens. That American
                                    missionaries will eventually find it impossible to work under
                                    Italian rule seems more than likely, but it would be far more
                                    dignified if, when the proper time comes, our institutions
                                    closed their doors of their own accord instead of yielding to
                                    the crude pressure it might seem determined to apply.</item>

                                that will raise question as to the status or recognition of Italian
                                Government in Ethiopia. Your effort should be confined to having

                                value of property requisitioned and prevent any unreasonable delay
                                in payment of amount of compensation determined. You will know
                                whether appeal will be allowed from Commission finding should it be
                                unsatisfactory.</p>

                                since its headquarters are in Canada, there is possibility that

                                helpful if a postponement of requisition proceedings could be
                                suggested to Rome as that is precisely what I have requested of the
                                Marshal who has doubtless referred the matter to Ministry of
                                Colonies.</p>

                            <p>178. By unpublished decree dated November 27 Italian authorities
                                requisitioned entire property of the Sudan Interior Mission
                                including all buildings, residences of staff and mission
                                headquarters at Akaki and Furi near Addis Ababa, together with
                                entire contents except personal belongings of missionaries. Decree
                                provided for a commission <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0391"
                                />to make list of properties and in consultation with mission to
                                estimate a fair value. Copy of decree was handed mission only on
                                December 2. Italian authorities refused request of mission for
                                postponement of action to permit consultation with mission
                                headquarters and apparently Italian commission is to proceed with
                                appraisal of properties without cooperation of missionaries.</p>
                            <p>Sudan Interior Mission appears to be partly American and partly
                                Canadian and British. The Department is now endeavoring to ascertain
                                the extent of the American interest. Meanwhile Engert has been
                                instructed to avoid taking any position which will raise question as
                                to status or recognition of Italian Government in Ethiopia and to
                                confine his efforts to having American interests given ample
                                opportunity to present evidence of value of property and to prevent
                                any undue delay in payment of compensation.</p>
                            <p>Engert reports it would be helpful if postponement of requisition
                                proceedings could be suggested at Rome. He has made a similar
                                request of Graziani who probably referred question to Ministry of
                                Colonies.</p>
                            <p>Unless you perceive some objection please take this matter up with
                                appropriate authorities and, after pointing out the haste with which
                                the requisition was made, request postponement of proceedings so
                                that American interests involved may have sufficient opportunity to
                                give consideration to a matter of importance to them.</p>

                                    xml:id="d397fn77">Not printed.</note> Marshal Graziani asked me
                                to call this morning and referring to a letter I had written to him
                                on December 6 requesting postponement of requisition of Sudan
                                Interior Mission, he stated that the decision had not been his own
                                but had been taken in Rome. He then handed me a telegram from
                                    Lessona<note n="78" xml:id="d397fn78">Alessandro Lessona,
                                    Minister of the Colonies.</note> dated December 16 which said:
                                “Please send for the American Minister and tell him that after
                                showing him certain documents you hope he will not insist upon his
                                request.”</p>
                            <p>Marshal then gave me some five or six typewritten pages containing
                                alleged quotations from private letters sent to their families by
                                three members of the mission. Two of them are not American citizens.
                                The third is Miss Jean Trout, an American citizen, but the only
                                excerpt under her name consisted of three or four lines in which she
                                made a rather harmless reference to “Alice” which obviously stood
                                for the Italians. None of the quotations contained anything that was
                                not common knowledge such as references to the cutting of the
                                railroad, attacks on Addis Ababa, confused exchange situation, et
                                cetera.</p>
                            <p>In handing the papers back I said I wished first of all to express
                                surprise that an official and rather serious decision should be
                                based on purely personal remarks alleged to have been made by
                                missionaries in private letters which I assumed could have been
                                obtained only by the clandestine opening of such letters by the
                                authorities although the latter had always denied that a censorship
                                existed. The Marshal merely shrugged his shoulders and made no
                                comment.</p>
                            <p>I then said that only a small fraction of the evidence submitted to
                                me concerned an American citizen and that even if all quotations had
                                    <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0393"/>been taken from
                                American letters I should still feel that they did not warrant what
                                virtually amounted to the expulsion of the writers. The Marshal
                                asked me if I did not consider the passages I had read as
                                anti-Italian. I replied that he and I had always conversed with the
                                utmost frankness and that today too I would ask him to let me talk
                                to him unofficially and not as the representative of my country. He
                                said he was no diplomat but only a soldier and therefore always
                                liked to hear the truth.</p>
                            <p>I began by telling him (what he did not know) that American
                                missionary activities throughout the Near and Far East were nearly a
                                century old and that they had a very fine and universally recognized
                                record of achievement. Never in all this time had they taken part in
                                any political movements or been guilty of intrigue against the
                                legally constituted authorities. But I would ask him to remember
                                that they were very human and shared many of his and my frailties.
                                The very fact, for example, that their actions were totally devoid
                                of political motives and that in our country we were accustomed to
                                complete liberty of speech and conscience, might cause them to be
                                less discreet and guarded in expressing their personal views. I
                                begged the Marshal to bear in mind the psychological factor.
                                Although Ethiopia was one of the most pressing fields for American
                                missionary efforts much money had been spent and amazing results had
                                already been achieved with hospitals, schools, et cetera, throughout
                                the country. I then quoted the following passage from my personal
                                letter to him of December 6th: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“I believe Your Excellency will agree with me that the
                                        American missionaries connected with the Sudan Interior
                                        Mission and Leprosarium, as well as at Baku, generous
                                        philanthropic supporters in the United States are devoting
                                        their unselfish labors to precisely those tasks of a
                                        civilizing nature which the Italian authorities themselves
                                        profess a desire to see carried out for the uplift of the
                                        natives of this country. They would, therefore, seem to be
                                        entitled to the greatest sympathy and consideration at the
                                        hands of the authorities.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>In view of all this, I continued, what was more natural than that the
                                personal sympathies of the missionaries should be largely on the
                                side of the people among whom they were working and who had gained
                                their affection, rather than with the strangers, whose virtues they
                                had not yet learned to appreciate. It was in this light that any
                                indiscreet observations they may have made should be considered.</p>
                            <p>The Marshal said he understood me perfectly but apparently the policy
                                of his Government towards missionaries had been determined by a
                                variety of considerations and that he was powerless. He then asked
                                what reply he should make to Lessona. I told him I had no <pb
                                    n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0394"/>objection to his reporting
                                our conversation so long as he made its truthfulness quite clear. He
                                said he had already telegraphed to Rome my letter of December 6th
                                including the paragraph I had just read.</p>
                            <p>Later I had a talk with the Chief of Cabinet, Colonel Mazzi, and
                                asked him whether he thought the decision to close the mission
                                headquarters in Addis Ababa meant that the mission stations in the
                                interior would also be requisitioned. He replied that this was
                                undoubtedly the intention of the Italian Government. To my further
                                question whether similar action was contemplated with regard to
                                other American missionary institutions he said that he did not think
                                so, at least for the present.”</p>
                            <p>Since my 665, December 2nd, no attempt has been made to apply the
                                decree of November 27th.</p>

                                    <p>It is becoming increasingly evident that all missionaries in
                                        Ethiopia are hostile to Italy. With the progress of our
                                        operations in the west you should therefore make every
                                        effort to eliminate missionaries, both Europeans and
                                        Americans, as quickly as possible. We cannot tolerate

                                in mind that once consular office is closed it would presumably be

                                    are as no definite plans appear to have been made. All seem to

                                    arise. The general feeling, however, is that the situation
                                    cannot be prolonged indefinitely probably not beyond September
                                    or October and that even if annexation is not recognized the

                                    which would enable me to remain as long as the Department

                                    willing to act solely in a consular capacity provided the
                                    Department feels that this may offer a temporary solution.
                                    Moreover, the fact that I happen to know Italian has already
                                    proved very useful.</item>

                                <item>Should the Department prefer to withdraw me, Cramp, and at
                                    least one American clerk, should be kept here for the reasons
                                    indicated in paragraph 1 above. However, I am quite sure that
                                    the Italian authorities would not recognize him in any
                                    diplomatic capacity. Besides, Cramp has had no home leave since
                                    1933 and if the question of a fresh exequatur is to be avoided
                                    he might be prevented from leaving for a long time.</item>

                            <p>441. The press here indicates that the British Government has taken
                                steps in Washington to ascertain our views with respect to the
                                change of status of our respective representatives in Addis Ababa
                                and that the Secretary of State has said publicly that the
                                Government of the United States would act on its own initiative. If
                                these facts are accurate would it not be a good moment now for us to
                                announce Engert’s withdrawal from Addis Ababa leaving the affairs of
                                the Legation in the hands of a subordinate consular officer? Such
                                action would, of course, be greatly appreciated here and might well
                                facilitate matters now before the Foreign Office.</p>

                                have contemplated sending an officer to Addis Adaba with the thought
                                that he would take charge of our representation in a consular
                                capacity when Engert departs upon leave of absence which he desires
                                next spring.</p>

                            <p>The Secretary called me to his office this morning to discuss the
                                question of our representation in Addis Ababa. I explained that we
                                had had in mind keeping Mr. Engert there to assist in the protection
                                of those American missionaries in the unoccupied provinces <pb
                                    n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0399"/>and that it was the further
                                intention to send a consular officer to Ethiopia who, upon Mr.
                                Engert’s expected departure on leave of absence in the spring, could
                                take charge of the office in a consular capacity. Judge Moore<note
                                    n="91" xml:id="d407fn91">R. Walton Moore, Assistant Secretary of
                                    State.</note> inquired as to the necessity of keeping anyone in
                                Ethiopia, and I explained that the only two reasons from a point of
                                view of our interests were to protect our nationals and to furnish
                                us such information as might be available respecting the Italian
                                attitude toward our trade. Judge Moore was inclined to think that it
                                might be possible, in view of the assistance already rendered to our
                                missionaries and the numerous warnings given them and in view of the
                                unimportance of our trade, to withdraw our representation entirely.
                                The Secretary thought there might be some advantage in tapering off
                                our representation gradually by replacing Messrs. Engert and Cramp
                                by a consular officer in the very near future with the idea of
                                having the consular officer remain there until the situation became
                                somewhat more clarified, possibly only a few months. I explained
                                that the British Government had apparently encountered no difficulty
                                in sending two new consular officers to Ethiopia and that in so
                                doing they had not requested exequaturs. I further explained that
                                these British consular officers were not given recognition as such
                                by the Italians any more than the Italians recognized the diplomatic
                                status of the foreign missions still remaining in Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>It was finally agreed that it would be desirable for Judge Moore and
                                Mr. Murray to give further consideration to the matter early next
                                week, but the view seemed to prevail that Mr. Engert should be
                                replaced as early as possible by a consular officer. In this
                                connection the Secretary pointed out that if the Italian Government
                                raised any difficulty with respect to the assignment of a new
                                consular officer the obvious action would be for us to withdraw our
                                representation entirely.</p>

                                agreement as to the following underlying considerations in the
                                matter of our representation in Ethiopia: <list>

                                        Ababa. Mr. Phillips has pointed out in this connection that
                                        the early withdrawal of Mr. Engert would greatly strengthen
                                        his hand in certain negotiations at present in process with
                                        the Italian Government.</item>

                                    <item>It has been agreed that Mr. Cramp, the only other officer
                                        at Addis Ababa, should not be left in charge at that post
                                        and, for reasons of health, furthermore, must be withdrawn

                                    <item>In view of the stiffening attitude of the Italian
                                        Government regarding both the wording of the letters of
                                        credence of newly appointed ambassadors to Rome as well as
                                        the question of exequaturs for consular officers appointed
                                        to Ethiopia, it seems not at all improbable that the
                                        Italians may refuse to grant Mr. Hughes a visa unless we at
                                        the same time request for him an exequatur. Such a request
                                        would of course immediately precipitate the question of
                                        recognition of the Italian conquest of Ethiopia, which we
                                        are under no circumstances prepared to answer at this

                            <p>154. Department’s 146, November 5, 7 p.m. The Department has in mind
                                withdrawing Cramp from Addis Ababa and replacing him by Hughes,
                                recently at Tokyo and now in the United States. In view of the
                                recommendations in your 441, November 4, 1 p.m. it would be planned
                                to withdraw Engert soon after Hughes’ arrival and to have the latter
                                take charge of our interests in a purely consular capacity. Please
                                give us your views as to whether Italian authorities <pb n="336"
                                    xml:id="pg_336" facs="0401"/>would be likely to insist upon our

                            <p>166. Your 491, November 27, 5 p.m. According to Engert’s reports
                                Italian authorities in Ethiopia do not recognize “officially”
                                existing chiefs of missions any more than they do recently appointed
                                British consular officers. Under the circumstances do you not think
                                it would be in order to follow the British precedent and advise
                                Foreign Office of Hughes’ assignment to Addis Ababa in consular
                                capacity and to request that Italian Embassy in Washington be
                                authorized telegraphically to grant him visa? Or do you consider it
                                would be preferable first to assign Hughes to Rome to the Embassy or
                                to the Consulate General for a brief period, say 2 weeks, and have
                                him proceed to Addis Ababa from Rome? If arrangements can be made
                                promptly in Rome Hughes and wife can probably sail via Export Line
                                on December 8.</p>
                            <p>Please submit your recommendations.</p>

                            <p>498. Department’s 166, November 28, 3 p.m. In order to clarify the
                                situation in regard to the assignment of a new consular officer to
                                Addis Ababa I sent Reber to the Foreign Office this morning to
                                discuss this point informally. He was told that the normal procedure
                                would require an exequatur. On the other hand the Foreign Office
                                recognized that this procedure might be considered as constituting
                                    “<hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> recognition” and appreciated
                                the Department’s position. Should the Department desire to make a
                                change in the personnel or status of its office at Addis Ababa the
                                Italian authorities, he was informed, would regard such change
                                primarily as of American administrative concern; the new appointee
                                would not however be recognized officially as Consul but would have
                                the same status vis-à-vis the local officials as our present
                                personnel.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances if the Department is not prepared to leave
                                Cramp as consular officer in charge for the time being, which would
                                raise no question of principle, there would appear to be no
                                objection to following the British precedent and to advising the
                                Foreign Office of Hughes assignment in a consular capacity. I do not
                                consider it necessary first to assign Hughes to Rome.</p>
                            <p>Should the Department decide to adopt this course may I be authorized
                                to inform Count Ciano<note n="97" xml:id="d412fn97">Italian Minister

                                afternoon of the Department’s decision to assign Hughes to Addis
                                Ababa in a consular capacity and of your request that the Italian
                                Embassy in Washington be instructed to grant him a visa. I added
                                that it was the present intention of the Department to transfer
                                Engert in the not distant future. Count Ciano expressed much
                                appreciation adding that it is a “step in the right direction”. He
                                would like to issue the following statement which he wrote out in
                                his own hand but before doing so will await your approval: “Count
                                Ciano has received the American Ambassador who informed him that the
                                American Government had decided to appoint a consular officer to
                                Addis Ababa to take charge of the American interests in the place of
                                the former diplomatic representative”. Please reply as quickly as

                            <p>171. Your 506, December 3, 7 p.m. Please inform Count Ciano without
                                delay that this Government regards the transfer of Hughes to <pb

                                inquiry on the subject is made.</p>
                            <p>We cannot, therefore, approve any statement in the sense of that
                                suggested by Count Ciano and I feel sure he will agree with you as
                                to its inadvisability under the circumstances.</p>
                            <p>You should make it perfectly clear that this Government does not
                                contemplate instructing Engert to depart immediately upon Hughes’

                                within a reasonable time thereafter, this Government desires this

                            <p>You should also endeavor to dispel any impression that Count Ciano
                                may have that Engert’s transfer, when it occurs, is to be regarded
                                as having any political significance for such is emphatically not

                            <p>For your confidential information: you should bear in mind that any

                                Foreign Affairs that there is some difficulty in connection with the
                                visa of Hughes passport by the Italian Embassy in that it states
                                that he is assigned “to the Legation at Addis Ababa” instead of “to
                                Addis Ababa” to which latter designation the Italian authorities
                                agreed. As the objection of the Foreign Office is solely to the use
                                of the words “Legation at” on the passport itself I sincerely hope
                                that this matter may be satisfactorily arranged.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Philip Broadmead of the British Embassy called on me by
                                appointment on December 7 and said he was inquiring on behalf of the
                                Ambassador what, if any, plans this Government has to withdraw its
                                diplomatic representation at Addis Ababa at an early date.</p>
                            <p>I explained to Mr. Broadmead that Mr. Morris Hughes, lately Secretary
                                of Embassy in Tokyo, had been assigned as American Consul at Addis
                                Ababa to replace Mr. Cramp who is definitely departing from that
                                post, and I made it clear that Mr. Hughes’ assignment was purely a
                                routine administrative matter without any political significance
                                whatsoever. I also pointed out that while it was the present
                                intention of the Department to withdraw Mr. Engert in the not
                                distant future, we did not contemplate instructing him to depart
                                immediately or soon after Mr. Hughes’ arrival.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Broadmead then informed me that his Government had for some time
                                been desirous of withdrawing its diplomatic representation in Addis
                                Ababa but had delayed doing so owing to objections from the French
                                Government. While he was not entirely clear on the point, he seemed
                                to have the understanding that the withdrawal of the British
                                diplomatic representative would be regarded by his Government as
                                giving at least <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> recognition to the
                                Italian annexation of Ethiopia.<note n="1" xml:id="d420fn1">For

                            <p>I then made the observation to Mr. Broadmead that the eventual
                                withdrawal of Mr. Engert would not in the Department’s opinion
                                necessitate any final decision in the matter of recognition; Mr.
                                Broadmead, on the other hand, seemed to find it difficult to
                                understand how the withdrawal of diplomatic representation could
                                occur without political implications but added that he was not fully
                                informed at present as to his Government’s precise intentions in
                                this connection. He agreed with me, however, that if, as is the
                                case, the Italian Government recognizes neither the present
                                diplomatic nor consular officers functioning in Ethiopia it was
                                difficult to understand why the withdrawal of an unrecognized
                                diplomatic officer need necessarily be regarded as an act of
                                recognition.</p>

                            <p>In departing Mr. Broadmead promised to keep me informed of any
                                further developments that might come to his Embassy’s attention on

                                be better not to stress the proposed change in status of our
                                representation at Addis Ababa by making any formal announcement at
                                this time. Engert will probably be about to depart on leave towards
                                the end of February and the change in status will become known at
                                that time in a routine manner.</p>

                            Maryland, I have the honor to inform you that I am now in receipt of a
                            letter from the Honorable the Governor of Maryland. The Governor states
                            that the offending officers, Constable Clayton Ellison and Town Officer
                            Jacob Biddle, have been tried and fined and that both officers are no
                            longer in the public service. In transmitting this information the
                            Governor requests me to extend to you an expression of his apologies for
                            this incident which he profoundly deplores.</p>
                        <p>In conveying to you this message from the Governor of Maryland I desire
                            to add my own sincere expression of regret on the part of this
                            Government that you should have been subjected to discourteous treatment
                            and to assure you of the satisfaction with which I have learned of the
                            prompt remedial measures which have been taken by the Maryland
                            authorities. At the same time I consider it my duty to point out that
                            according to the available information this deplorable incident would
                            not have occurred had your chauffeur observed the regulations in force
                            in Elkton regarding the speed limit of automotive vehicles.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I may state that this Government has at all times
                            impressed upon its own diplomatic officers in foreign countries that the
                            enjoyment of diplomatic immunity imposes upon them the obligation and
                            responsibility of according scrupulous regard to the laws and
                            regulations, both national and local, of the countries to which they are
                            accredited. I feel confident that the Iranian Government will share the
                            view that this Government is justified in expecting that foreign
                            diplomatic officers accredited to the United States will manifest a
                            similar regard for the laws and regulations in force in this
                            country.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Ghaffar Djalal, the Iranian Minister, came to see me this morning by
                            appointment with regard to the note of December 6, 1935 addressed to him
                            by the Secretary of State conveying the apologies of the Governor of
                            Maryland and the sincere regrets of the Secretary on behalf of this
                            Government over the incident of the Minister’s arrest, handcuffing and
                            detainment on November 27, last, at Elkton, Maryland, upon a charge of
                            speeding.</p>
                        <p>The Minister expressed himself satisfied with the apologies and regrets
                            contained in the Secretary’s note under reference, but appeared
                            considerably worried over the references in the note to the violation
                                <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0409"/>by his chauffeur of speed
                            regulations in Elkton and particularly the final sentence of the note,
                            reading as follows: “I feel confident that the Iranian Government will
                            share the view that this Government is justified in expecting that
                            foreign diplomatic officers accredited to the United States will
                            manifest a similar regard for the laws and regulations in force in this
                            country.” The Minister maintained that the Secretary’s note gave the
                            impression that he was in the habit of violating the laws and
                            regulations of this country, which was not the case. I pointed out to
                            the Minister that specific reference in this connection was made to his
                            chauffeur, and not to him personally, and added that the above quoted
                            final sentence of the Secretary’s note logically followed the statement
                            made in the last paragraph thereof setting forth the attitude of this
                            Government regarding the observance by its own diplomatic officers in
                            foreign countries of the laws and regulations of such countries.</p>
                        <p>I reminded the Minister at the same time of the great concern which is
                            being shown all over the United States at this time over the alarming
                            increase in fatalities resulting from automobile accidents and I
                            referred to the energetic “safety campaign” which is being conducted at
                            present in the national capital as well as in many other parts of the
                            United States. I also pointed out that there has existed for many years
                            in this country a widespread resentment over the unfortunate attitude of
                            some diplomatic officers—generally subordinate ones—in this country to
                            regard their privilege of diplomatic immunity as a license to violate
                            our laws and regulations. This feeling in the United States must
                            necessarily be taken into account by the Secretary of State in handling
                            an incident of this kind. While in no way justifying the unwarranted and
                            deplorable action of the Maryland police authorities for which the
                            regrets and apologies of both the Federal government as well as the
                            State government of Maryland had been extended to the Minister, the
                            Secretary felt it only proper to point out that the incident in question
                            would not have occurred had the Minister’s chauffeur not been guilty of
                            violating the speed regulations of the town of Elkton.</p>
                        <p>The Minister asked me whether we could not communicate with our Legation
                            in Teheran in this matter, clarifying the misapprehension which he
                            feared might exist in the mind of the Iranian Government regarding his
                            customarily law-abiding behavior. While assuring the Minister that we
                            had not intended to give the impression that he or members of his staff
                            had repeatedly violated our laws and regulations, I said that due
                            consideration would be given to his present request.</p>

                        <p>2. My telegram No. 1, January 2, 6 p.m. Bitter press attacks upon
                            American Government for failure to obtain public retraction from certain
                            American newspapers continues with increasing vigor in local
                            publications. Strongly hinted that arrest of Djalal inspired by
                            Washington. Four of the newspapers making attacks owned by Majlis. Claim
                            for damages or expulsion of missionaries may be motive. Threat of
                            rupture of diplomatic relations contained in all newspapers. Have thus
                            far ignored newspaper tirade but in event am summoned to Foreign Office
                            think it advisable to furnish Legation with actual facts connected with
                            arrest of Minister. Recall of Djalal officially confirmed.<note n="3a"

                        <p>1. Your 2, January 7, 11 a.m. Full details and documents regarding
                            Djalal’s arrest and subsequent action by this Government were
                            transmitted in Department’s instruction No. 167 of December 12 forwarded
                            via Cairo and Baghdad pouch on Steamship <hi rend="italic"
                                >Excalibur</hi> due at Alexandria Janury 9. Pouch should reach
                            Baghdad within the next few days and presumably will be forwarded via
                            British courier.</p>
                        <p>In case the Iranian Government approaches you officially in the matter
                            before you are in possession of full details, you should explain that
                            fact. You should however state that as soon as this Government was
                            informed of the incident the Secretary of State expressed his personal
                            regrets to the Minister and urged the Governor of Maryland <pb n="347"
                                xml:id="pg_347" facs="0412"/>to take immediate steps to bring about
                            the dismissal and punishment of the offending police officers. This
                            action was taken without delay. In a letter received at the same time
                            from the Governor he requested the Secretary to convey to the Iranian
                            Minister an expression of his sincere apologies. In communicating these
                            sentiments to the Minister the Secretary added his formal regrets on
                            behalf of this Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department considers that the amends made for this unfortunate
                            occurrence were adequate in every respect and that they in fact exceed
                            the action that might have been considered necessary under the
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the Minister has been instructed to state that
                            his Government considers the incident closed, the Department approves of
                            your having ignored the press tirade on this subject and wishes you to
                            continue to assume an attitude of reserve unless the Iranian Government
                            takes the matter up with you officially.</p>
                        <p>With reference to this Government “obtaining public retraction from
                            certain American newpapers” you should of course, if the need arises,
                            point out that freedom of the press is guaranteed in this country by the
                            Constitution.</p>

                                printed.</note> For Henderson from Bullitt. The substance of your
                            telegram under reference has been brought to the attention of the
                            Secretary of State and other interested officials of the Department, and
                            you are authorized to communicate with the Iranian Chargé d’Affaires in
                            the following sense:</p>
                        <p>This Government has always entertained and continues to entertain most
                            friendly sentiments toward His Majesty Reza Shah as well as His
                            Majesty’s Government and people and has much appreciated the confidence
                            reposed in the United States in times past by the people of Iran as
                            exemplified on numerous occasions too well known in Iran to require
                            recital. The American Government and people have furthermore followed
                            with admiration the great progress made in Iran under the leadership of
                            Reza Shah, who is reviving the national spirit of a race that occupied a
                            great place in history.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the unfortunate incident at Elkton, which this Government
                            profoundly deplored, His Majesty is presumably fully informed of the
                            prompt and energetic steps taken by this Government <pb n="348"
                                xml:id="pg_348" facs="0413"/>and the Governor of Maryland to make
                            amends, with which the Iranian Government has declared itself satisfied.
                            This Government regrets, however, the necessity of pointing out in this
                            connection that the incident itself would and could have been avoided if
                            the Iranian Minister had respected American laws or if, after having
                            violated them, he had exercised the tact and discretion which His
                            Majesty undoubtedly expects of his representatives in this country.</p>
                        <p>As regards the attitude of the American press toward Djalal, over which
                            this Government has no control whatsoever, it is again a cause for
                            regret to point out that such discourteous comments as were made
                            regarding him resulted without doubt from his failure to assume at the
                            time of the incident an attitude of dignified reserve rather than the
                            contrary. It should be emphasized however that regardless of such
                            comments as those referred to above, it would appear that the Iranian
                            Government is in error in believing that there was any American “press
                            campaign of deriding all things Iranian.” The Department, which has
                            followed closely all press comment on the incident, has observed no such
                            disposition on the part of the American press and believes that no such
                            feeling exists in this country. There does however exist here a
                            widespread feeling against any disposition on the part of foreign
                            diplomatic representatives in this country to regard their diplomatic
                            immunity as a license to violate any American laws or regulations, and
                            it was this feeling, rather than any criticism of Reza Shah or his
                            country, that was reflected in the press accounts and editorial
                            discussions of the incident.</p>
                        <p>This Government desires in conclusion to assure the Iranian Government
                            that it intends to employ its best efforts to safeguard and strengthen
                            the many ties of friendship and sympathetic understanding that have long
                            united the two peoples and earnestly hopes His Majesty is animated by
                            the same purpose. [Bullitt.]</p>

                                printed.</note> The Iranian Chargé d’Affaires in conversation on
                            January 21 with an official of the Department stated that his Government
                            believed that there was a close connection between the Elkton incident
                            and the fact that Djalal by his earlier activities in connection with
                            the Geneva Arms Convention had incurred the displeasure of the Secretary
                            of State.<note n="5" xml:id="d432fn5">See <ref
                                    target="frus1934v01#pg_449"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                        <p>The Chargé further expressed the view that the confusion in the mind of
                            the Iranian Government and the continued agitation in Teheran over the
                            Elkton incident was due to the fact that the Iranian Government was not
                            furnished at the time with copies of the depositions of the offending
                            police officers and of eye-witnesses declaring that the Minister’s
                            arrest resulted largely from having lost his temper and having behaved
                            in an unbecoming and provocative manner. The Chargé pointed out that in
                            the absence of such information his Government had assumed that all
                            press accounts of the Minister’s behavior at the time of the incident
                            were fabrications as Djalal had declared them to be.</p>
                        <p>It was explained to the Chargé that the Department had not furnished, or
                            even referred to, the depositions in question because it did not
                            consider that any circumstances attending the incident in any way
                            condoned the action of the police in arresting the Minister and had
                            insisted upon the dismissal and punishment of the officers regardless of
                            any wrongdoing on Djalal’s part.</p>
                        <p>If, however, as now appears to be the case, the Iranian Government’s
                            misgivings and misinterpretation of this unfortunate affair would be
                            dispelled by furnishing the Foreign Minister with copies of the
                            depositions in question, forwarded with the Department’s instruction No.
                            167 of December 12, 1935, you are authorized to do so without delay. You
                            should at the same time explain this Government’s reasons as set forth
                            above for not furnishing copies of these documents at an earlier moment.
                            You may also state that it would hardly appear necessary to point out
                            the absurdity of connecting the Elkton incident with Djalal’s earlier
                            activities in connection with the Arms Convention.</p>

                            Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs resulted in agreement that he will
                            strongly recommend to the Council of Ministers that Djalal matter be now
                            regarded as closed incident. Foreign Office, however, still expects me
                            to submit depositions upon their receipt from Cairo.</p>

                        <p>The Chargé d’Affaires of Iran handed me this morning a translation<note
                                n="7" xml:id="d435fn7">Not printed.</note> and copy of a message
                            which he had just received from his Government with regard to a recent
                            publication in the New York <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> referring to
                            the Shah as formerly a stable hand; the Chargé admitted that the
                            instruction came directly from the Shah himself. After reading it I
                            expressed astonishment at its terms, saying that it was scarcely the
                            kind of message which passed between two friendly governments; I did not
                            wish, therefore, to discuss it, but would prefer to discuss the
                            unfortunate publication of the <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi>. I
                            thereupon laid the Shah’s message aside and took up the accompanying
                                message<note n="7" xml:id="d435fn8">Not printed.</note> left by the
                            Chargé, which dealt only with the <hi rend="italic">Mirror’s</hi>
                            publication; I said that this Government naturally regretted any
                            indignity against the head of a friendly state which had been committed
                            in this country, either by the press or otherwise; I pointed out that,
                            in this particular incident, the <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> was a
                            very unimportant publication, with a limited circulation and, in
                            consequence, that this particular reference to the Shah would be noticed
                            by very few people and even by them promptly forgotten; I explained the
                            lack of control which this Government had over the American press, which
                            I felt sure he fully understood; if, for example, the Department should
                            communicate in writing with the <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> or make
                            any protest with regard to this particular incident, the <hi
                                rend="italic">Mirror</hi> would, in all probability publicize this
                            fact and the objectionable reference to the Shah would consequently be
                            broadcast throughout the country and the incident, which is now
                            unnoticed, could very easily become known throughout the nation because
                            of what might be interpreted by the American press as governmental
                            restraint exercised upon an independent American journal. Furthermore, I
                            added that I was doubtful whether our laws, which guaranteed <pb n="351"
                                xml:id="pg_351" facs="0416"/>freedom of the press, would operate in
                            this particular case; I would, of course, be very glad to study our laws
                            to see whether they might apply in such a way that this Government could
                            properly make representations to the <hi rend="italic">Mirror.</hi></p>
                        <p>The Chargé d’Affaires expressed gratification at my reply, intimated,
                            nevertheless, that he would like to see some action taken by the
                            Department vis-à-vis the <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> and expressed the
                            hope that I could give him some answer to his instructions on Monday

                        <p>I went to see the Iranian Chargé d’Affaires on Sunday morning, March 15,
                            to discuss the message which he left with the Under Secretary on March
                            14 in which the Iranian Government threatened that it will “revise their
                            political relations with the United States” unless this Government takes
                            immediate steps, “even making an exception in this case,” to cause the
                            New York <hi rend="italic">Daily Mirror</hi> to retract the statement
                            made in its issue of February 8, 1936 to the effect that the Shah “was
                            formerly employed in the stables of the British Legation in
                            Teheran.”</p>
                        <p>In reply to my inquiry of Mr. Ghods as to his explanation for this
                            extraordinary communication, he reiterated the old story about the
                            Shah’s extreme sensitiveness to foreign criticism and said he felt sure
                            that the Iranian Foreign Minister who signed the telegram was carrying
                            out the exact instructions of the Shah. He confirmed my impression that
                            the Shah would have little hesitation in going through with his threat
                            unless something could be done at this end to appease the Shah’s wrath.
                            He furthermore confirmed a suspicion I had had that the reception
                            scheduled for last Saturday evening at the Iranian Legation in honor of
                            the Shah’s birthday had been called off by specific order of His Majesty
                            and that the motivation for this action was undoubtedly the story in the
                            New York <hi rend="italic">Daily Mirror.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Ghods then recounted his conversation with the Under Secretary, which
                            he described as “extremely helpful.” He said he had immediately wired
                            his Government and pointed out that Mr. Phillips, in view of his great
                            friendliness to Iran, did not wish to consider that an unfriendly
                            communication had been delivered to him; that Mr. Phillips <pb n="352"
                                xml:id="pg_352" facs="0417"/>had, however, assured him that he would
                            examine carefully into the situation and if it were possible under
                            American law he would see to it that punishment was meted out for the
                            offending article. In other words, Mr. Ghods was very happy that Mr.
                            Phillips had not turned him down at once, since a communication in that
                            sense to his Government would, he felt, have resulted in immediate and
                            drastic action in Teheran. He said he intended to call at the Department
                            the following day, when he hoped to receive further word as to the
                            action which the Department was prepared to take under the
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to Mr. Ghods the unusual character of his Government’s
                            demands and emphasized again to him that the freedom of the press in
                            this country is not merely an empty phrase but is a very actual reality.
                            He said he realized this fully but that unfortunately the Shah of Iran
                            did not and was unwilling to accept any such excuses where criticism of
                            his person was concerned. Mr. Ghods told me that he had written twice to
                            the Editor of the New York <hi rend="italic">Daily Mirror</hi>
                            requesting him to correct the false statement but that his requests had
                            been ignored. He therefore felt that he had no other alternative than to
                            appeal to the Department for help.</p>
                        <p>I questioned Mr. Ghods closely as to whether, in the event the
                            Department, as an entirely exceptional measure, endeavored to bring
                            about a retraction of the offensive statement, the Iranian Government
                            would consider such action as a precedent and would consider itself
                            justified in demanding that we follow the same procedure in all future
                            instances where something unpleasant or untrue might be said regarding
                            the Shah. The Chargé said he thought the present case could be handled
                            in such a manner that his Government would be given to understand that a
                            precedent was not being established and that our action in this instance
                            was entirely exceptional and a gesture of good-will to the Shah. I
                            emphasized to Mr. Ghods the absolute necessity of making this point
                            clear to his Government since any misunderstanding in the matter could
                            only create further difficulties.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Chargé whether he thought it desirable to bring our Legation
                            in Teheran into the picture in any manner. He said he thought it would
                            be better to leave the matter for the time being entirely in his hands
                            since everything depended on the exact wording of any communications
                            delivered to the Iranian Government on this subject. I think his
                            suggestion is a wise one, everything considered.</p>
                        <p>After discussing this question with Mr. McDermott<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d436fn8">Michael J. McDermott, Chief of the Division of
                                Current Information.</note> yesterday morning, it was decided that
                            any direct communication between the Department and the Editor of the
                            New York <hi rend="italic">Daily Mirror</hi> would be <pb n="353"
                                xml:id="pg_353" facs="0418"/>ill-advised. It was suggested that I
                            endeavor to get in communication with Mr. James T. Williams, personal
                            representative of Mr. Hearst in Washington, and discuss the situation
                            with him in complete confidence. I explained the matter fully and in
                            confidence to Mr. Williams this morning, who seemed to appreciate fully
                            the difficulty in which the Department is placed and, while pointing out
                            that he had no authority whatsoever over the Editor of the New York <hi
                                rend="italic">Daily Mirror</hi>, said he would be glad to
                            communicate directly by long distance telephone with Mr. Hearst and put
                            the matter up to him. He reminded me that no assurances could be given
                            that the Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> could be brought to
                            take the action desired by the Iranian Government but assured me that he
                            (Mr. Williams) would do his best.</p>
                        <p>There the matter stands for the time being. Mr. Williams is coming to see
                            me this afternoon to discuss further phases of the matter before he
                            takes it up with Mr. Hearst.</p>

                        <p>I sent for the Iranian Chargé d’Affaires this afternoon and referred to
                            my last conversation with him on Saturday morning when I told him that I
                            would look into the matter which he had presented to me and would advise
                            him whether any action could be taken by the Government against the New
                            York <hi rend="italic">Daily Mirror</hi>. I said that I was now
                            satisfied, although I regretted this fact very much, that there was
                            nothing in our laws that permitted the Government to take any step
                            vis-à-vis the <hi rend="italic">Mirror;</hi> however, as we were anxious
                            to show the Shah every consideration in this case, we had not abandoned
                            hope that something could be done to elicit some expression of regret or
                            correction by the <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> itself; we had today
                            asked a third person, who was in a position to approach the <hi
                                rend="italic">Mirror</hi> independently to see what could be done in
                            the circumstances; I wished it understood, however, that this action on
                            our part was not to be taken as a precedent; as the Chargé d’Affaires
                            well understood, some of our papers had been guilty of indignities
                            against the chiefs of other states, viz., Japan, the King of Rumania,
                            the Queen Mother of Rumania, Hitler, Mussolini; unfortunately, they had
                            all been caricatured at one time or another, and it was even possible
                            that something might be said in the future which would not be pleasant
                            reading to the Shah himself; we could guarantee nothing, but in order to
                            show our friendly feelings toward Iran and the Iranian people we were
                            making this special effort in this particular case.</p>

                        <p>The Chargé d’Affaires expressed much appreciation of our efforts in his
                            Government’s behalf; he expressed the hope that the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mirror</hi> would not publish the letter which he himself had
                            written to the <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> two or three days after the
                            incident; the incident having progressed as far as it had, the

                            sufficient by the Shah; he hoped, therefore, that some expression by the
                                <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> itself would be given.</p>

                            upon me to protest against the article which appeared in the New York

                            exceptional measure, to have the article amended. I told him that in

                            States I preferred not to discuss the message but rather the unfortunate
                                <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> article.</p>
                        <p>I said that this Government naturally regretted any indignity against the
                            head of a friendly state, explained that the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mirror</hi> was an unimportant journal with limited circulation,
                            and that the reference to the Shah would be noticed by few and promptly
                            forgotten even by them. I also pointed out the lack of control which
                            this Government had over the American press and expressed doubt whether,
                            in view of the constitutional provisions concerning freedom of the
                            press, there was any law which would apply in such a case as that
                            presented. I agreed, however, to study the situation with the utmost
                            goodwill.</p>
                        <p>After careful consideration the Department is left in no doubt that this
                            Government is entirely without means to take any legal action in this
                            matter. However, in order to demonstrate clearly our sincere desire to
                            liquidate this incident to the satisfaction of the Iranian Government we
                            are approaching the publishers and urging them, as a matter of
                            cooperation and in the interest of our continued friendly relations with
                            Iran, to publish a suitable correction.</p>
                        <p>On March 17 I conveyed to the Iranian Chargé d’Affaires the information
                            contained in the preceding paragraph.</p>
                        <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0420"/>
                        <p>The foregoing is for your information. In view of the delicate character
                            of the question you should refrain from taking it up in Teheran.
                            However, if the subject is broached to you, you should be guided by the
                            above considerations, in which connection you should stress these
                            obvious facts: (1) that this Government, under its constitution, is
                            prohibited from interfering in any manner with the freedom of the press
                            and (2) that the action it is taking with a view to obtaining a
                            correction by the New York <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> is altogether
                            unique and is being taken only because of its sincere desire to
                            cultivate friendly relations with Iran. It must not be regarded as
                            constituting a precedent and you should lay particular emphasis on that
                            point in any conversations into which you are drawn.</p>

                        <p>26. I have just been informed by Soheily<note n="8b" xml:id="d441fn8b">A.
                                Soheily, Iranian Under Secretary of State for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> that the Iranian Government has recalled all its
                            representatives in the United States. Dissatisfaction with the <hi
                                rend="italic">Mirror</hi> article and the retraction was given as
                            the reason. He added that the Government had the friendliest feelings
                            towards me, would continue to be most friendly and would maintain
                            relations with this Legation.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I felt at a loss what to say as I considered we had gone
                            the full limit and beyond to adjust recent incidents. I emphasized that
                            we had paid no attention to the scurrilous anti-American campaign here
                            in the controlled press, making the points covered in Murray’s letter of
                            February 26th.<note n="9" xml:id="d441fn9">Not found in Department

                        <p>To this the Under Secretary made no reply saying that he was merely
                            acting as a messenger. According to Soheily retraction though adequate
                            from western standpoint revived ill-feeling by repeated reference to
                            Shah’s alleged earlier career.</p>
                        <p>Although he stated that the Shah had not been shown the correction it is
                            difficult to conceive that a decision of this importance has been taken
                            without his Majesty’s approval. But he said that the Cabinet Ministers
                            all agreed that they should not maintain representatives to be witnesses
                            to affronts to the Shah.</p>

                        <p>15. Department’s No. 12, March 26, 6 p.m. On March 28 the Iranian Chargé
                            d’Affaires made an urgent request for an interview and on instructions
                            from his Government handed me the following communication:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows substance of information given by the Iranian Under
                            Secretary of State to the American Chargé as noted in telegram No. 26,

                        <p>I expressed to the Chargé my astonishment and regret that the Shah should

                                xml:id="pg_357" facs="0422"/>good-will and sympathy of the American
                            Government and people and asked him to convey at once a message to the
                            Shah in the following sense: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Secretary of State speaking for his Government expressed
                                    great surprise and regret when I acquainted him with your
                                    message proposing to dissolve diplomatic relations. He said that
                                    his Government and the entire American people are now and have
                                    been wholeheartedly friendly towards His Majesty the Shah and
                                    the Iranian people; that only a few scattering irresponsible and
                                    uncontrollable newspapers have been more or less critical, but
                                    with no ill will. The Secretary of State earnestly requests, on
                                    behalf of his Government, that the Iranian Government delay the
                                    proposed action for one or two weeks until that Government can
                                    more fully and more to its satisfaction ascertain the exact
                                    truth regarding the warm friendship of this Government and the
                                    people of this country towards His Majesty and the people of
                                    Iran.”</p>

                        <p>This message was telegraphed to Teheran immediately by the Chargé and he
                            received a curt reply on March 29 instructing him to carry out the
                            Shah’s orders to close the Legation and return to Iran, together with
                            all Iranian career consular officers in this country.</p>
                        <p>Please telegraph any information you may be able to obtain which would
                            throw light on the attitude of the Shah which to us is not only
                            surprising but incomprehensible.</p>
                        <p>I should also like to have you endeavor to ascertain discreetly and
                            informally and report immediately whether a request, if made, that the
                            Shah receive a special envoy to be sent to Iran to discuss the present
                            situation would meet with a favorable response. It would be the purpose

                        <p>27. My telegram of March 29, 5 p.m. The action of the Iranian Government
                            seems most ill-suited for its purpose since it appears inevitable that
                            in commenting thereon the press will make statements which will be
                            viewed as affronts here. There is thus a possibility that if we do not
                            withdraw our representatives from Iran they will sooner or later be sent
                            out by the Iranian Government. This is offered for thought purely in
                            connection with other considerations as it would be unfortunate to
                            withdraw solely for an eventuality which did not happen.</p>

                        <p>In conversation yesterday afternoon with the Iranian Chargé d’Affaires he
                            took great pains to emphasize to me that the decision of his Government
                            to withdraw all Iranian representatives in this country and to close the
                            Iranian Legation in Washington would not in any way affect the status of
                            our Legation in Teheran. He explained that in withdrawing Iranian
                            representation in this country the Shah had desired to indicate his
                            displeasure over the attitude of the American press towards himself
                            personally and towards Iran in general. Since the Shah was not in any
                            way displeased with the American Legation in Teheran, the Iranian
                            Government would continue, as in the past, to have most friendly
                            relations with that Legation and to conduct business with it as usual. I
                            inferred, in fact, from the Iranian Chargé’s remarks that his Government
                            would be displeased if we took any steps to reduce the present status of
                            our representation in Iran.</p>
                        <p>It is clear from the above that the present action of the Iranian
                            Government cannot in any way be regarded as a severance of diplomatic
                            relations between the two countries. It is solely a unilateral act on
                            the part of the Iranian Government to give emphasis to the Shah’s
                            displeasure over the attitude of the American press.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Turkey called upon his own request and stated to me
                            that the Iranian Government had requested the Turkish Government,
                            through its representative in Washington and in any other practical way,
                            to take over the interests of the Iranian Government in the United
                            States and to give them such care and attention as they might be able
                            and as was customary in the existing relations between this Government
                            and the Iranian Government, the latter having recalled its
                            representatives from this country, but, at the same time, given full
                            permission to the United States Chargé at Teheran to remain there and
                            keep in normal touch and relationship with the Iranian Government.</p>
                        <p>I promptly replied that I knew of no Government anywhere more competent
                            and suitable thus to represent the Iranian Government and to take care
                            of its interests and affairs in this country than the Government of
                            Turkey through its representative here, and, of course, <pb n="359"
                                xml:id="pg_359" facs="0424"/>I knew of no country which to us the
                            assumption of this task would afford more satisfaction than such action
                            by the Turkish Government. I then expressed both the surprise and
                            disappointment I felt at the unexpected action of the Shah of Iran after
                            he had received a retraction from Mr. Hearst of the false publication in
                            the New York <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi>, about which the Shah had
                            chiefly complained.</p>
                        <p>I then briefly rehearsed the pros and cons of the relations between the
                            two governments from the time of the arrest of the Iranian Minister at
                            Elkton, Maryland, upon the charge of speeding until today. The Turkish
                            Minister [<hi rend="italic">Ambassador</hi>] showed genuine sympathetic
                            interest in the attitude of the United States with respect to these two
                            incidents and assured me that he would watch every opportunity to aid in
                            making clear to the Iranian Government and its Ruler the wholehearted
                            friendliness of our people towards him and the Iranian people, and, at
                            the same time, would strive to convince the Shah of the complete
                            satisfaction which this Government had really given him and also given
                            his Government and which, if understood fully by the Shah, should be
                            promptly accepted.</p>

                        <p>30. Yesterday the question of sending special envoy was broached
                            informally to the Under Secretary and to the Chief of the Third
                            Political Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The matter was
                            presented as an idea originating in the Legation which would be
                            submitted to the Department if well received here. Reaction of both
                            officials was favorable although the latter expressed doubt as to
                            efficacy if further exceptionable articles should appear. In any event
                            the matter will be presented to the Foreign Minister and to the Shah for
                            consideration after which I shall report further.</p>

                        <p>31. My telegram No. 30, April 6, noon. This morning Soheily said he had
                            delayed until day before yesterday discussing idea of special <pb

                            more favorable atmosphere. The Minister received the idea very favorably
                            but desired further information on the following points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Rank of the envoy. He desires an ambassador

                                <item>Impervious assurance that the envoy would have as his sole
                                    mission the improvement of existing relations, that he would not
                                    be permanently assigned as Minister to Iran nor act in any way
                                    as trade representative as a certain Belgian Ambassador at Large
                                    had done.</item>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>He was informed that the Legation would be glad to present the matter for
                            the Department’s consideration and that no difficulty was anticipated
                            over the considerations mentioned under 3 or 4 above as the Legation’s
                            ideas were in complete accord with those of his Minister.</p>
                        <p>It was strongly emphasized to him that the purposes of a special mission
                            might at any time be vitiated owing to the supersensitiveness of the
                            Shah to irresponsible press articles but both Soheily and the Minister
                            with whom he immediately conferred in this respect thought His Majesty
                            could be handled successfully. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that an
                            assurance that a special mission would be well-received by the Shah
                            should be obtained before it is authorized.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Seyfullah, Secretary of the Turkish Embassy, in calling today on
                            another matter stated that the Embassy had now received instructions
                            from Ankara directing it to have the Turkish Consul in New York perform
                            consular duties on behalf of the Iranian Government. Beginning today,
                            therefore, the Turkish Consul in New York would be prepared to certify
                            consular invoices, certificates of origin and other documents covering
                            American exports to Iran. Mr. Seyfullah added that their instructions
                            had directed that the Czechoslovak Consul in Chicago should continue to
                            perform Iranian consular functions. Apparently the Czechoslovak
                            Government, however, was anxious to be relieved of this burden, and Mr.
                            Seyfullah expressed the view that probably within the next two months
                            the Czechoslovak Consul would be relieved of his functions on behalf of
                            the Iranian Government and that thereafter documents originating in
                            Chicago and requiring Iranian consular services would be handled by the
                            Turkish Consul in New York.</p>

                        <p>22. Your 31, April 16, noon. Mr. Hornibrook has returned and has informed
                            the Department of the conversation which he had on March 15th with Mr.
                            Kazemi, then Minister for Foreign Affairs. In that conversation Mr.
                            Kazemi thought fit to urge that this Government take steps to amend the
                            Constitution so as to restrict the freedom of the press. The absolute
                            impossibility of any such steps must be clear to anyone who is familiar
                            with American institutions and the American form of government.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances it is apparent that no useful purpose could be
                            served by sending a special envoy to Teheran and the proposed mission
                            has therefore been definitely abandoned.</p>
                        <p>Please bring the foregoing to the attention of the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, leaving with him an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of your
                            conversation.</p>

                        <p>33. On May 6 I called on Soheily since previous discussions regarding
                            special mission had been with him. I left two <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoires</hi> the drafting of which was extremely delicate,
                            one containing merely the substance of the Department’s No. 22 April 30,
                            7 p.m., the other adding a quotation of the pertinent portion of the
                            Constitution, explaining that it had been in force for nearly 150 years,
                            the indispensable role played by a free press under our system, the
                            procedure of amendment and that an amendment restricting freedom of the
                            press was not a practical possibility. It went on to describe
                            Department’s hard work in securing correction as evidence both of its
                            good will and as further proof that our Government had no control over
                            the press adding that its action could not be considered a precedent.
                            Both documents asked him to bring contents to the attention of his
                            Minister. I explained that the first covered my instructions but that I
                            would leave the second, if he thought it preferable, for presentation to
                            higher authority.</p>
                        <p>Soheily was deeply disappointed that the mission would not be sent and
                            vented his feeling on Kazemi whose suggestion to Hornibrook he thought
                            was an unwarranted interference in the internal affairs <pb n="362"
                                xml:id="pg_362" facs="0427"/>of another country. He himself would
                            have refused to discuss such a request had it been made of him and for
                            this reason he believed there must have been a misunderstanding. He
                            asked whether this consideration was the real reason for the
                            Department’s decision or a pretext.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I did not think the Department had been particularly
                            disturbed by that phase of it. I thought the Department argued that if
                            Kazemi who had some years in the United States knew so little of our
                            Government and institutions, it would be a hopeless task for a special
                            envoy, who would be regarded as a special pleader, to convince the
                            Iranian Government of the facts. As to a pretext I said the <hi
                                rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> contained the sole reason given by
                            the Department for rejecting the idea of a special mission and it was
                            impossible to say whether, independently of Kazemi’s remark, the
                            Department would have arrived at the same decision or not.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary was extremely loath to accept any <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> on the ground that the suggestion had come from
                            us and not from the Iranian Foreign Office. On my explaining that I was
                            carrying out instructions and that I thought the Secretary wished to
                            show that he had given the idea of a special mission serious and careful
                            consideration and desired a written record of the fact in the Iranian
                            archives he consented to keep them for further study. He seemed
                            painfully afraid that the rejection of the idea of a mission might be
                            thought a rebuff to Iran and I had to emphasize that it was solely the
                            Legation’s idea that was being turned down and that the <hi
                                rend="italic">aide-Mémoire</hi> so stated.</p>
                        <p>He asked to see the interpreter this afternoon and returned both
                            documents saying that the Foreign Minister agreed that as the special
                            envoy had not been solicited by Iran there was no occasion to have
                            anything in writing. He said he had found a note of Kazemi that the
                            United States Government should take steps to protect foreign sovereigns
                            from the press and he felt sure Kazemi had gone no further than that. He
                            seemed very discouraged that the idea of the mission had been
                            rejected.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion the plan was attractive to the Foreign Office, which has
                            not been in the good graces of the Shah recently, because it could say
                            to His Majesty that it had arranged for a great power like ourselves to
                            go to this length to request the restoration of Iranian representation.
                            The Foreign Office would therefore tend to encourage the sending of a
                            mission whatever the chances of success. Nevertheless I believe Soheily
                            is sincere in expressing the informal opinion that a special mission
                            offers the best method of righting the present situation.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I believe it would be both wise and useful to explain the Department’s
                            rejection of a special mission on the basis of a partial
                            misunderstanding <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0428"/>of Kazemi’s
                            suggestion and to keep the question open with the idea that an envoy
                            will be sent if and when we have reasonable assurance that he can
                            succeed.</p>

                        <p>24. Your 33, May 9, 5 p.m. You should seek an early occasion to impress
                            upon Soheily that there was no misunderstanding whatever of the
                            representations which Kazemi made to Mr. Hornibrook on March 15. Mr.
                            Hornibrook’s report on this matter confirmed by your despatch 743, March
                                17,<note n="10" xml:id="d451fn10">Not printed.</note> makes it
                            perfectly clear that Kazemi envisaged an amendment of the American
                            Constitution with a view to restricting the freedom of the press. It
                            should be unnecessary to remind the Iranian authorities that this
                            Government cannot even discuss with any foreign government such a wholly
                            unwarranted suggestion.</p>
                        <p>You should also impress upon Soheily that the Department’s decision that
                            no useful purpose would be served by following your suggestion regarding
                            the sending of a special envoy to Teheran was not based upon any pretext
                            but upon the nature of Kazemi’s representations referred to above.</p>
                        <p>In this connection the Department desires that in any further
                            conversations on this subject between you and Iranian officials you
                            adhere closely to the substance of the Department’s instructions and
                            refrain from any speculative interpretation of the Department’s views
                            such as that contained in the first sentence of paragraph 3 of your
                            telegram under reference.</p>
                        <p>For the time being at least the Department proposes to give no further
                            consideration to the matter of sending a special envoy to Teheran.
                            Inasmuch as you presented the suggestion in the first instance as coming
                            from the Legation and in view of Kazemi’s insistence respecting our
                            Constitution, the Department perceives no reason why the present
                            authorities at the Foreign Office should feel any embarrassment in
                            regarding the matter of the special envoy as closed.</p>
                        <p>Department does not understand your reference to the situation as being
                            “precarious” because of certain American press comments made subsequent
                            to the Iranian withdrawal. If you refer to the situation of our mission
                            in Iran your grounds for such a statement should be made clear without
                            delay.</p>
                        <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0429"/>
                        <p>For your confidential information and general guidance, the Department is
                            not inclined to view with any particular concern the mere withdrawal of
                            Iranian representation in Washington provided the Iranian Government
                            continues normal relations with our Legation at Teheran. That
                            Government’s intention to continue such relations was reported in your
                            telegram No. 26, March 29, 5 p.m. Your relations with the Iranians
                            should therefore be cordial and scrupulously correct and you should
                            carefully avoid giving any impression that you fear that any
                            developments such as press comments in this country might alter the <hi

                        <p>34. Motamedi, Chief of the Third Political Division, asked me to see him
                            this morning. He had been instructed by the Foreign Minister to say that
                            unless American press articles offensive to the Shah should cease at
                            once the Iranian Government would be obliged to sever all diplomatic and
                            economic relations with the United States. Displaying clippings from the
                                <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> dated March 31 and April 5
                            and from the <hi rend="italic">Louisville Post</hi> of April 1, he said
                            his Government expected that such articles would cease following
                            withdrawal of its representatives but that they had continued without
                            interruption. He asked whether my Government could not do something to
                            stop repugnant comments whereupon I thoroughly went over the ground
                            covered in the long <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> described in
                            paragraph 1 of my telegram No. 33, May 9, 5 p.m.</p>
                        <p>He made the suggestion which he asked me to communicate that the
                            Secretary of State might call in correspondents and ask them to desist
                            from writing items derogatory to the Shah and to Iran and emphasize the
                            harmful effects to American trade which would result if this were not
                            done. He made it clear that the severance of economic relations would
                            mean complete stoppage of Iranian imports from the United States. I
                            pointed out to him that reciprocal measures of this kind would hurt Iran
                            more than ourselves and promised to communicate his remarks and the
                            reply of my Government.</p>
                        <p>Department’s telegram 24, May 15, 5 p.m. I am convinced likewise that
                            Kazemi suggested constitutional amendment is an oversimplification. My
                            despatch No. 743<note n="11" xml:id="d452fn11">Not printed.</note> is
                            not a confirmation but merely reported Mr. Hornibrook’s summary analysis
                            of the results of <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0430"/>his
                            conversations with the Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and
                            other high officials on March 15th. I believe that Mr. Hornibrook
                            himself said on his own initiative purely as a measure to gain time and
                            without promising results that he would do what he could to secure
                            constitutional amendment upon his return and that Kazemi merely
                            expressed hope and expectation of success. Rejection of special mission
                            on this uncertain ground is undesirable. As the idea has been decently
                            buried for considerations that seem adequate to the Foreign Office I
                            hesitate to reopen this unpleasant subject involving the press without
                            further instructions particularly in view of the main subject of this
                            telegram.</p>
                        <p>A special mission might save the present situation though probably only
                            temporarily.</p>
                        <p>My relations with Iranians have been perfectly friendly and correct and I
                            have not given and will not give the impression that the Legation will
                            not carry on. I have, however, felt bound to advise American interests
                            to tread carefully.</p>

                            you perceive some objection, the Department wishes you to address, with
                            appropriate salutation and subscription, the following personal letter
                            to the Foreign Minister: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Your Excellency will recall that I informed you last Tuesday,
                                    May 19, of the statement made to me orally by the Chief of the
                                    Third Political Division in connection with certain recent items
                                    in the American press and that I requested you to be so good as
                                    to furnish me with a statement in writing of the intentions of
                                    the Iranian Government.</p>
                                <p>I feel sure Your Excellency will appreciate the heavy
                                    responsibility that rests upon me in interpreting in all clarity
                                    to my Government the exact position of your Government in this
                                    matter.</p>
                                <p>To this end and to avoid any misunderstanding that might have far
                                    reaching consequences, I venture, as a sincere friend of your
                                    country, to address you thus personally in order to reiterate
                                    the importance which I feel sure my Government attaches to the
                                    receipt of the requested statement in writing.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>For your confidential information, the Department’s purpose in suggesting
                            this particular means of communication is two-fold: (1) to make it more
                            difficult for the Foreign Minister to evade the Department’s request
                            while (2) presumably affording him a convenient means of avoiding the
                            necessity of making your communication a part of the official Iranian
                            record.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that your letter, if dispatched, be accompanied by a
                            Persian translation carefully prepared by the Legation Interpreter and
                            checked by yourself. You will of course refrain from acquainting the
                            Interpreter with the origin of the letter.</p>
                        <p>Please continue to keep the Department promptly informed by telegraph of
                            all important developments.</p>

                        <p>41. My telegram No. 35, May 19, 5 p.m. Yesterday Chief of the Third
                            Political Division informed me of decision not to state Iranian position
                            in writing. He said that if no more exceptional press articles appeared
                            no further communication on the subject would be made but if they
                            continued the Legation would receive a written communication along the
                            lines of his statement of May 17, reported in the first sentence of my
                            telegram No. 34, May 17, noon. He gave as the reason for the decision
                            the fact that the position had already been set forth verbally and since
                            the Foreign Office was satisfied that it had been accurately
                            communicated to the Department there was no necessity for putting it in
                            writing.</p>
                        <p>Motamedi said the attitude of the Government was that of waiting and
                            watching the American press. He intimated that a reasonably written
                            statement would be likely to bring from us an explanation that we could
                            do nothing about the press, a fact which was known.</p>
                        <p>Iranian position seems illogical from our point of view because it seeks
                            to place upon us a responsibility which we are unable to accept under
                            our system. On the other hand, the Iranians feel that they could not
                            continue relations with a government which, whatever the reason, either
                            cannot or will not protect the name of their sovereign and nation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that at the request of His Excellency A. Soheily, Under Secretary of
                            State for Foreign Affairs, I called upon him at the Foreign Office on
                            July 23, 1936, accompanied by the Legation Interpreter.</p>
                        <p>Somewhat wearily, and with a smile which appeared to me to indicate that
                            his heart was not in it, Mr. Soheily produced a clipping from the <hi
                                rend="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</hi> of June 13, 1936 which, under the
                            caption “Stranger than Fiction,” reproduced a sketch of the Shah, with
                            the legend: “The present Shah of Persia descends from no long line of
                            royalty—he himself was a stable boy originally.”</p>
                        <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0433"/>
                        <p>His Excellency said that he had had the clipping on his desk for some
                            time and had been undecided whether to bring it to my notice, but he had
                            eventually concluded that it would be best to do so. He said that he
                            realized my Government had no control over the press, but asked me to
                            request the Department of State to make an investigation with a view to
                            determining what lay behind the publication of such derogatory remarks
                            in the American press which, as I could observe, kept recurring.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I first observed that the same sketch contained a somewhat
                            derogatory reference to the American Pilgrims, and then briefly
                            described the serial nature of the drawing, which merely illustrated
                            facts unusual to Americans. The latter generally assumed that the Shah
                            had inherited the throne of Iran from a long line of former Shahs. To
                            them, therefore, the fact that His Imperial Majesty was what we would
                            call a “self-made man”, would be unusual. Far, however, from considering
                            either the legend or the sketch derogatory, the American reaction would
                            be just the opposite. The “self-made man” was a type with which we were
                            thoroughly familiar and which we admired and respected. There was a
                            suspicion in the United States that whatever a man inherited, he
                            possibly would not have been able to acquire or achieve by his own
                            efforts. But we knew that any individual who, like the present Shah, had
                            hewn his way through to the top, must be a real and a great man.</p>
                        <p>I added that the statement which appeared in the legend was perhaps
                            derived from the unfortunate <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> article, and
                            that I would communicate his request to the Department of State which
                            was, of course, as interested as the Iranian Government in discovering
                            whether there was any force at work which felt that it had something to
                            gain by disturbing Irano-American relations through the appearance of
                            offensive statements in the press concerning the Shah. I doubted
                            greatly, however, whether any such state of affairs existed, was
                            convinced that American journalists and editors had only sincere
                            feelings of friendship and admiration for Iran and the Shah, and said
                            that such unfortunate statements as appeared could be laid to
                            ignorance.</p>
                        <p>I then pointed out that if the legend had been intended to be derogatory,
                            this feeling would have been reflected in the drawing. But the sketch
                            was of a vigorous, capable and intelligent man. I added a few remarks to
                            the effect that the origins of several of our Presidents had been
                            humble, but that this fact increased their appeal to the people of the
                            country and the respect in which they were held, rather than the
                            reverse.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Soheily replied that His Majesty had never claimed to be descended
                            from a line of kings, and that French publications had from time to time
                            referred to the Shah’s earlier career as a private soldier, <pb n="369"
                                xml:id="pg_369" facs="0434"/>and to this His Majesty had taken no
                            exception, but that he did take exception to references to himself as a
                            “stable-boy”, which were not true.</p>
                        <p>I replied that the original statement to the latter effect had appeared
                            in the <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> and that, as the Under Secretary
                            knew, this untrue statement had been corrected.</p>
                        <p>Considering the opportunity a good one, as Soheily seemed to be carrying
                            out his duty without real zest and with some boredom, although
                            conscientiously, I remarked that although the American press had given a
                            good deal of annoyance to the Iranian Government, it could be turned to
                            good account. I hoped that when a new Iranian Minister should be
                            appointed to Washington, he would approach the press directly and in the
                            right way; he would find that it was conducted by friendly, decent and
                            capable men who would willingly learn the truth about Iran, and print
                            material that would be pleasing both to Iran and to ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Soheily observed that it did not look as though the appointment of a new
                            Minister would take place in the near future.</p>
                        <p>I said that naturally I did not presume to assume that a new Minister
                            would be appointed soon, though of course I hoped one would be. I was
                            merely trying to state the problem he would be up against, and to
                            indicate some of the methods of dealing with it based on my personal
                            knowledge of American conditions.</p>
                        <p>Soheily then said that huge appropriations would be needed to use with
                            the foreign press for the purposes which I mentioned, which were not
                            available.</p>
                        <p>I said that an appropriation was unnecessary, that I did not have paid
                            propaganda in mind—that, as a matter of fact, it was impossible to buy
                            news space in American journals. What I had in mind was that the new
                            Minister would best meet the press problem by cultivating friendly
                            personal relations with journalists and editors, and by informing them
                            of what was going on in Iran. These men were friendly disposed and on
                            the lookout for new and unusual material, and there was certainly an
                            enormous amount of interest attaching to this country of which they were
                            now largely in ignorance.</p>
                        <p>I added that American newspaper men hated nothing more than to see a
                            foreign Minister running to the Department of State with complaints
                            about the press. They liked a direct approach, and if an Iranian
                            Minister who should be displeased about the press went directly to the
                            editor and asked: “Why do you print such things about us?” he would be
                            likely to get satisfactory results.</p>
                        <p>Soheily was unwilling to be led too far astray, and merely repeated his
                            original request, to which I again assented. In reply to a question
                            intended to bring out how much urgency he attached to the matter, he
                            said that he did not think there was any necessity for using <pb n="370"
                                xml:id="pg_370" facs="0435"/>the telegraph, but that he did wish to
                            have a definite reply, because he was keenly interested in establishing
                            who or what, in Iran, the United States or elsewhere, was responsible
                            for attaching to the Shah, in the American press, descriptions of an
                            untrue and offensive nature. He thought that it would be better to
                            explain the matter fully to the Department of State in writing, and not
                            to use the telegraph.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the interview, he said smilingly that by now I must
                            feel sure, every time he asked me to see him, that some bad news was in
                            store. I replied cheerfully that it did not bother me in the slightest
                            and that I was quite used to it, though I hoped that some day he would
                            have something pleasant to impart.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, I should be grateful if the Department would
                            ascertain and forward to this Legation, for verbal communication to the
                            Under Secretary, the source of the statement printed with the sketch
                            above-mentioned and also, if possible, the source of the similar
                            statement contained in the notorious <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi>
                            article of February 8, 1936. As respects the latter, I have seen several
                            vague statements to the effect that the assertion in the <hi
                                rend="italic">Mirror</hi> that the Shah was once a “stable-boy” in
                            the service of the British Legation was based on a similar assertion
                            which appeared previously in some non-American publication. While we
                            should not seek to shift an unpleasant burden from our own press to the
                            press of any other particular country, it would help a good deal if we
                            could be in a position to say definitely that the statement had been
                            taken from the press of an unnamed foreign country. Of course, if the
                            Department should find that there is some individual or interest which
                            has been creating difficulties by causing the publication of troublesome
                            items, that would be extremely valuable information to lay before the
                            Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>Several conclusions from the interview with the Under Secretary may now
                            be ventured, which will already have occurred to the Department. One is
                            that Soheily, and I think the rest of the Foreign Office, must now have
                            firmly implanted in their minds the fact that the American press is free
                            and independent and that there is nothing our Government can do to
                            control it. Another is that the Under Secretary himself, and possibly
                            also the Foreign Minister, are pretty well bored with the attitude of
                            the Shah toward the foreign press.</p>
                        <p>During the conversation the Interpreter was able to ascertain that the
                            clipping in question had been reported, but not actually shown, to the
                            Shah. It may reasonably be inferred, I think, that the Foreign Office
                            lacks any desire to have the ultimatum to the effect that the Legation
                            would be sent away if more objectionable articles should appear, carried
                            out. Whenever possible, therefore, as in this instance, it can be
                            counted upon to present American press matters to His Majesty in such a
                            way that his wrath will not be rekindled.</p>

                        <p>I am under the impression, however, that the suspicion of the Foreign
                            Office that some person is in back of exceptionable articles in the
                            American press, is quite sincere.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Merriam</hi>: Your letter under date of
                            June 24th,<note n="13" xml:id="d459fn13">Not found in Department
                                files.</note> was received today and I hasten to correct what
                            appears to be a misapprehension as to representations which were made by
                            the Legation to the Iranian Government in connection with the attacks of
                            the American press against the Shah.</p>
                        <p>In your letter you state: “According to my recollection, it was the
                            Legation which on the 14th or the 15th of March suggested that you would
                            do what you could about securing legal protection for foreign sovereigns
                            from the American press when you reached home”.</p>
                        <p>No such representations were at any time made by me, nor by any member of
                            the Legation staff. The only representations authorized, and the only
                            representations made as far as my knowledge goes, were in the form of a
                            definite promise that I would be very glad indeed to present in their
                            entirety, the views of the Iranian Government pertaining to a change in
                            our Constitution immediately upon the date of my arrival in Washington.
                            It was also rather broadly hinted to Soheily, that it would perhaps be
                            unwise for the Foreign Office to take any further action in connection
                            with its complaint as to unfriendly newspaper publicity in the American
                            Press prior to the date of my arrival in Washington and the submission
                            of my personal report on American-Iranian relations. This was done in
                            the hope that a “cooling time” would thus be provided during the period
                            that I was in transit. It was hinted that at such conference there might
                            be a possibility of working out informally, some plan with the American
                            Press Association which would be helpful, but at no time was an express
                            or implied promise given that such an objective could be obtained, that
                            I proposed to recommend a change in the organic laws of the United
                            States or that I would do more than to present the views of the Iranian
                            Foreign Office as to such proposed change.</p>
                        <p>The first intimation that Kazemi proposed to ask us to change our
                            constitutional provisions came in the form of a veiled hint a week or
                            two prior to the day of my departure, I think on the occasion when <pb
                                n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0437"/>I asked for an audience with
                            the Shah or at one of the numerous diplomatic dinners, but the proposal
                            took definite shape and form in all of its banality at the dinner given
                            by the Prime Minister on the eve of my departure. I outlined to you
                            briefly, the substance of that conversation just prior to leaving
                            Teheran on the following morning but so the matter may be clarified in
                            your mind and that there may be no doubt as to just what transpired at
                            that interview, I am reducing to writing the salient features of the
                            same to the end that it may be retained as a part of the permanent
                            records of the Legation.</p>
                        <p>In anything but a happy and agreeable frame of mind, Kazemi approached me
                            shortly after the dinner with a rather undiplomatic and bold statement
                            that “articles such as recently appeared in the New York newspapers must
                            be stopped by your Government”. I once again called his attention to the
                            constitutional provisions guaranteeing the freedom of the press, pointed
                            out the impossibility of the Department exercising legal control over
                            American publications, and asserted any suggestions which proposed to
                            take away the constitutional provisions guaranteeing such freedom would,
                            in all probability meet with vigorous opposition, both from members of
                            Congress and the newspapers affected. I added that the publication of
                            this and other articles of an uncomplimentary character were a matter of
                            great regret to the Department and to myself and attempted to the best
                            of my ability to minimize the effect of the same upon public sentiment
                            in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Kazemi was in no frame of mind to listen to explanations. His reply was
                            in the form of a question and an answer and was as follows: “Is not
                            France like the United States, a Republican form of Government? France
                            only recently changed its laws so that unpleasant comments about
                            sovereigns of friendly states are now prohibited. What France did I am
                            sure that your Country could do even tho a change in your laws would be
                            necessary in order to accomplish this purpose”.</p>
                        <p>I then explained to the Minister the long series of delays that would of
                            necessity ensue under our form of Government in the event that a
                            proposal of this character should be formally submitted to Congress. I
                            ventured the opinion that perhaps the best that could be hoped for would
                            be informal representations to the press by the Department of State but
                            that I was not authorized to give any assurance as to the Department’s
                            position on that subject. I did agree, however, to submit his views to
                            Washington as soon as I arrived, and, if, after the matter had been
                            discussed I could find a way to be helpful, I would, of course, do what
                            I could to work out some informal solution of the difficulty. This angle
                            of the situation was thoroughly explored while I was in Washington with
                            the result that <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0438"/>Department
                            officials agreed the time was not opportune to take the matter up
                            officially with the American Press Association.</p>
                        <p>The final words of the Minister were: “We are depending upon your
                            Government to make the necessary changes in your laws and we are
                            depending upon you to present our views to Washington”. He asked as to
                            the exact date of my arrival in New York and reminded me once or twice
                            that he fully expected me to take the matter up both with the President
                            and the Secretary of State. It should, therefore, appear quite plain
                            that Kazemi left nothing to imagination or surmise.</p>
                        <p>[The remainder of this letter is of a personal nature unrelated to the
                            subject discussed above.]</p>

                        <p>48. Unprecedented flood has occurred at Mehabad (formerly Saujbulak)
                            causing destruction of 500 houses and the loss of more than 25 lives.
                            American lives and property there believed, safe. Also a severe
                            earthquake has shaken Tabriz. Americans there are safe but extent of the
                            damage if any to mission property is unknown at present. Recently there
                            have been serious floods and earthquakes in several parts of the
                            country. The Shah has personally contributed substantial relief
                            funds.</p>
                        <p>Improved atmosphere now observable, would be strengthened by a direct

                            as I am aware thus far no chief of state has so acted. No allusion shall

                        <p>34. Your 48, August 7, noon. The President telegraphed the following
                            message to the Shah on August 7: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Deeply moved by the suffering caused by the recent floods and
                                    earthquakes in Your Imperial Majesty’s dominions, I desire to
                                    extend to Your Imperial Majesty the expression of my profound
                                    sympathy.”</p>

                        <p>In this connection and for your confidential information the Turkish
                            Ambassador in Washington has suggested to his Government that the
                            Turkish Ambassador in Teheran be authorized to approach the Shah
                            informally and on his own responsibility with a view to making clear to
                            the Shah the situation in this country respecting freedom of the press
                            and American institutions in general.</p>
                        <p>In making this suggestion to his Government the Turkish Ambassador here
                            has, at the Department’s request, emphasized the fact that the
                            suggestion did not emanate from this Government and the Turkish
                            Ambassador in Teheran will be instructed to carefully avoid giving the
                            Shah any reason to believe that this Government is at all concerned over
                            the continued absence of Iranian representation in Washington.</p>
                        <p>If this matter is mentioned to you by the Turkish Ambassador you will

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department acknowledges the receipt of
                            your despatch No. 860 of July 25, 1936, reporting your conversation with
                            the Iranian Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with reference
                            to an item which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</hi>
                            of June 13, 1936, concerning the Shah. Your observations to Mr. Soheily,
                            as reported in your despatch under reference, meet with the Department’s
                            approval.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the request of Mr. Soheily that the Department “make an
                            investigation with a view to determining what lay behind the publication
                            of such derogatory remarks in the American press”, it is clear from the
                            Department’s inquiries and from its general knowledge of the subject
                            that no agencies are working in this country with a view to weakening
                            the long established ties of friendship between Iran and the United
                            States. As you explained to the Under Secretary at the time of your
                            interview, statements regarding the Shah such as that which appeared in
                            the <hi rend="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</hi>, even when they are erroneous,
                            are in no wise intended to be derogatory to His Imperial Majesty. On the
                            contrary, the people of this country from the earliest days have
                            cherished the highest admiration for persons who have risen to positions
                            of eminence as a result of their own ability and force of character. In
                            this connection it is perhaps needless to recall that President Lincoln,
                            who is admittedly an outstanding American statesman and an international
                            figure, is even to this day commonly referred to as “The Rail-splitter”
                            from the fact that in his youth he earned his <pb n="375"
                                xml:id="pg_375" facs="0440"/>living by splitting trees for fence
                            rails. That President Lincoln started life in such humble labors only
                            adds to the admiration in which he is held by the people of this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, when the American press refers to the vigorous and manly
                            background of the Shah, such references, even though historically
                            inaccurate in certain instances, can be interpreted only as an effort,
                            possibly misguided but nevertheless sincere, to honor His Imperial
                            Majesty and raise him even higher in the estimation of the American
                            people. Moreover, that the American press and the American people are
                            animated by the most friendly sentiments towards Iran and towards its
                            eminent ruler are clearly indicated by the numerous articles which
                            appear in the daily papers and in periodicals commenting upon the rapid
                            progress which Iran has made under the guidance of His Imperial
                            Majesty.</p>
                        <p>The Department is therefore entirely persuaded that no agencies are
                            working in this country with a view to beclouding American-Iranian
                            relations. Indeed, even if inimical agencies should attempt to promote
                            unfriendly feelings between the United States and Iran, it is difficult
                            to understand how they could hope to succeed in the face of the obvious
                            fact that the two countries have no conflicting interests.</p>
                        <p>You may bring the foregoing orally to the attention of Mr. Soheily and
                            assure him in the most express terms that not only is this Government
                            convinced that there are no factors seeking to weaken the ties of
                            friendship between the two countries, but also that in the view of the
                            Department no real basis exists upon which such a movement could be
                            founded.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                            is being withheld from delivery upon entry into Iran, I have the honor
                            to report that I have taken pains to ascertain whether this measure has
                            been taken solely with respect to second-class mail of American origin,
                            or with respect to all second-class mail of foreign origin.</p>
                        <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0441"/>
                        <p>According to the information that has come in from a large number of
                            sources, the conclusion appears inescapable that only American
                            second-class mail is being so treated. No announcement or explanation
                            has been forthcoming from the authorities in this connection, but there
                            seems to be little doubt that American newspapers and magazines are not
                            being delivered in view of the consideration that some of them are
                            likely to contain exceptionable commentaries upon the withdrawal of the
                            Iranian representatives from the United States<note n="15"
                                xml:id="d463fn15">For the account of the withdrawal of Iranian

                            of which in this country would naturally be deemed undesirable.</p>
                        <p>Publications carrying items of this sort could be expected to arrive from
                            the present time to the end of about three weeks, but nondelivery dates
                            from about two weeks ago, thus coinciding with the withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>The withholding of American second-class mail has caused considerable
                            inconvenience and annoyance to subscribers, both American and of other
                            nationalities, and vigorous protests have been voiced to the postal
                            authorities by private individuals, one of the most vigorous having been
                            lodged by the American-born wife of a high official at the Ministry of
                            Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>The Legation is, and doubtless will continue to be, under strong pressure
                            to protest. The British Chargé, who lays considerable store by a certain
                            American newspaper, has told me that if and when I should decide to make
                            representations, he would be glad to associate his personal protest. I
                            have considered, however, that it would be unwise, in the absence of
                            instructions from the Department, to take up the matter officially for
                            the present, since the desire of the Iranian Government to prohibit
                            circulation of printed matter in Iran which would be derogatory in tone
                            or language to Iran or to the Shah is perfectly understandable. The
                            diffusion of articles considered to be wounding to Iran or to His
                            Majesty would in fact only serve to endanger the delicate relations
                            which now exist, and might result in action by the Iranian Government of
                            the nature indicated in my telegram No. 27 of March 30, 7 p.m.<note

                        <p>I think it preferable, therefore, to take no official notice of the
                            non-delivery of American second-class mail until all the comments upon
                            the withdrawal of the Iranian representatives which can reasonably be
                            expected shall have ceased, and then merely to request information and
                            explanations, but to refrain from lodging anything in the nature of a
                            protest in the absence of specific instructions from the Department.</p>
                        <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0442"/>
                        <p>The measure has resulted in absurdities, as all general measures of the
                            kind are bound to do, for technical publications such as the <hi
                                rend="italic">American Medical Journal</hi> which under no stretch
                            of the imagination would be likely to contain any thing of an
                            exceptionable nature, have been held up along with publications of a
                            more general sort. The Government, of course, does not have such
                            facilities as would enable it to examine all second-class mail coming
                            from the United States and to eliminate only those publications the
                            circulation of which is not desired.</p>
                        <p>Newspapers and magazines arriving for members of the Legation staff via
                            the Department and the United States Despatch Agent at London have been
                            delivered up to the present time, presumably because the packages within
                            which the publications are rolled appear to have an official
                            character.</p>
                        <p>Several instances in which letters have been opened and not officially
                            resealed have also come to my notice. But this attention has been
                            devoted to the mail of all nationalities without any apparent
                            discrimination, and is probably related to the enforcement of the
                            Foreign Exchange Control Law.</p>

                            No. 766 of April 15, 1936 on the above subject, and to report that
                            second-class mail matter of American origin still remains
                            undelivered.</p>
                        <p>On the occasion of an interview which I had with the Under Secretary of
                            the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 6th I brought up this matter by
                            inquiring when subscribers to American publications could expect to
                            receive them, pointing out that many technical papers could not under
                            any stretch of the imagination be thought to contain anything relating
                            to Iran. I also told him of the large number of protests I had
                            received.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary replied that he also had heard a large number of
                            complaints on the subject, and promised “to do something about it.”</p>
                        <p>When the Interpreter of the Legation saw the Under Secretary again on May
                            9th, he had in mind the thoroughly offensive articles on the Iranian
                            withdrawal which appeared in the issue of <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>
                            dated April 13th, and several other articles containing unfortunate
                            references to the Shah and to Iran which had recently come to the
                            Legation’s attention. He therefore asked the Under Secretary whether the
                            latter had <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0443"/>recently seen any
                            objectionable clippings from the American press. Mr. Soheily replied
                            that he had not, and that those which he had seen were very much along
                            the lines of what had appeared in the press of Teheran.</p>
                        <p>On May 3d, Mr. Gharib, Chief of the Press Bureau at the Foreign Office,
                            had asked me to send him all the clippings I could from the American
                            press on the subject of the Iranian withdrawal. At the same time he said
                            he felt very friendly to Americans, regretted what had taken place, and
                            so forth and so on. The following day I sent him two perfectly
                            unexceptionable clippings, as I saw no reason why the Legation should
                            cut off its own nose by sending him everything it had
                            indiscriminately.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday I saw Mr. Gharib again at the Iran Club and asked him whether
                            he had seen any large number of recent clippings. He said that he had,
                            and that a number of them had “une très mauvaise tournure”, from which I
                            gather that the Foreign Office now knows the worst and is deciding what
                            to do about it. It would not surprise me in the slightest if, sometime
                            within the next two weeks, the Legation were packed off, with or without
                            baggage, a possibility that was forecast in my telegram No. 27 of March
                            30, 7 p.m.<note n="17" xml:id="d464fn17"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>,
                                    <ref target="#pg_357">p. 357</ref>.</note> On the other hand, we
                            have had so much consistent bad luck that it seems impossible that it
                            can hold.</p>
                        <p>As a further indication of the way the wind blows I may add that Mr.
                            Myron Bement Smith, American architect-archaeologist at Isfahan, has
                            been privately advised by M. Godard, the Frenchman in charge of the
                            Iranian antiquities department, to be extremely careful in everything
                            that he does.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances, any insistence that American newspapers and
                            magazines should be allowed to come through would seem out of place for
                            the present.</p>

                        <p>I got in touch with Mr. Weber of the International Postal Service
                            Division of the Post Office Department today in connection with the
                            non-delivery in Iran of second-class mail matter originating in this
                            country and asked him whether he knew of any other similar cases which
                            might serve as a precedent for the drastic action of the Iranian
                            Government.</p>
                        <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0444"/>
                        <p>Mr. Weber stated that cases regarding the prohibition of specific items
                            or types of second-class mail matter are of course very common and cited
                            a number of such instances with reference to prohibitions maintained by
                            Canada, British India, Japan, Czechoslovakia and Australia. In all of
                            these instances, however, the prohibition was always on a book,
                            pamphlet, particular issue of a periodical, or all issues of certain
                            types of periodicals, with such restriction usually being based upon
                            moral or political grounds. Mr. Weber was not aware, on the other hand,
                            of any previous cases where a blanket prohibition had been placed upon
                            all printed matter from this country.</p>
                        <p>When questioned as to whether the action of the Iranian Government might
                            in any way contravene the provisions of the Universal Postal Convention
                            signed in Cairo on March 20, 1934,<note n="18" xml:id="d465fn18">49
                                Stat. 2741.</note> Mr. Weber stated that he did not believe that the
                            Iranians would be restricted by that agreement and referred specifically
                            to Article 46, Section 1 (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) thereof, which
                            provides that objects of which the admission or the circulation is
                            prohibited in the country of destination should not be accepted for
                            transmission but that in the event of their having been transmitted they
                            should be subject to the domestic regulations of such administration as
                            may discover them.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 795 of May 15, 1936 reporting developments in the situation created
                            by the non-delivery in Iran of American second-class mail matter.</p>
                        <p>It is a pleasure to be able to inform the Department that a considerable
                            number of deliveries has recently taken place of books, advertising
                            matter, magazines of an innocuous type such as college alumni
                            publications, and a very restricted number of magazines and newspapers
                            of a general character which have evidently been opened and
                            inspected.</p>
                        <p>The Legation, and more particularly the Consulate, have been bombarded
                            with protests on this subject from Americans in Iran, particularly
                            missionaries, who became somewhat acid at the withholding of their
                            publications, but are now back on the alkaline side.</p>
                        <p>The Legation can lay no claim to the partial solution of this matter, in
                            regard to which it has taken no official action aside from my inquiry of
                            the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on May <pb n="380"
                                xml:id="pg_380" facs="0445"/>6th which was reported in despatch No.
                            795 of May 15, 1936. The Legation did not want to be in the position of
                            requesting the release of the material only to have articles wounding to
                            the Shah and to Iran broadcast throughout the country, and for this
                            reason it has refrained from requesting instructions from the Department
                            to this end. The whole matter was felt to be one of extreme delicacy and
                            it is not surprising that subscribers, in large part missionaries living
                            in remote stations who were and are unaware of exactly how delicate the
                            situation is, should have become somewhat indignant and if they should
                            feel, as I have no doubt they do, that the Legation has been
                            unnecessarily weak about the whole thing.</p>
                        <p>A large number of protests has been lodged by missionaries and many other
                            persons with post office and police officials, and it is the cumulative
                            effect of these, it would seem, that has brought the Government to the
                            point of sorting through the mail and delivering a portion of what was
                            found to be non-objectionable.</p>
                        <p>It may be added for the Department’s information that I have twice had an
                            opportunity to comb through a portion of the American newspaper file at
                            the Foreign Office, and in each instance I have been greatly relieved to
                            find no magazine clippings. This feeling stems from the fact that the
                            magazine <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> has handled the Djalal incident,
                            the Iranian withdrawal, and the Ghods matter, with a thoroughgoing lack
                            of tact and good taste. It is impossible for me to open my copy, which
                            comes via London and is therefore not held up, without a feeling of
                            apprehension.</p>
                        <p>It is to be hoped that the censor, in clearing American secondclass mail
                            matter, will not clip magazine articles of this nature for distribution
                            to the Government.</p>

                            the action of the Iranian Postal Authorities in placing a prohibition on
                            the delivery of second-class publications from the United States due to
                            the appearance in some of said publications of matter deemed by the
                            Iranian Government to be of an objectionable nature.</p>
                        <p>While this Department would have no objection to representations on the

                            of international mails, the Postal Administration of Iran has a right to

                            Authorities in not delivering second-class publications from the United
                            States due to the appearance in some of said publications of matter
                            deemed by the Iranian Government to be of an objectionable nature.</p>
                        <p>It is desired to point out that while, as stated in the letter of this
                            Department on the subject dated July 2, 1936, IHW–F–163/19–8111, the
                            Postal Administration of Iran has a right to consider the publications
                            in question as prohibited articles and to treat the same in accordance
                            with its domestic regulations, it is contrary to the usual practice in
                            the International Postal Union service for one Postal Union country to
                            prohibit delivery of all publications from another Postal Union country
                            because some of the publications sent from such other country contain
                            matter objectionable to the country of destination.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of this Department, the action of the Iranian
                            Administration was not justified. In regular course, that Administration
                            should have notified this Department as to the publications that had
                            been found to contain objectionable matter in order that dispatch of
                            such publications to Iran could have been withheld and the publishers so

                            letter of August 21, 1936, regarding the action of the Iranian postal
                            authorities in withholding delivery of a certain second-class mail
                            matter of American origin.</p>
                        <p>Particular note has been taken of the last paragraph of your letter
                            wherein you state that you regard the action of the Iranian Postal
                            Administration as unjustified but that in any event that Administration
                            should have notified your Department as to publications found to contain
                            objectionable matter in order that dispatch of such publications to Iran
                            could have been withheld and the publishers so notified. It is presumed
                            that reference is made in this connection to Article 28 of the Universal
                            Postal Union Convention of Cairo providing for notification in the event
                            of temporary suspension of postal services in whole or in part.</p>
                        <p>In view of the facts set forth in your letter the Department suggests
                            that it would seem desirable if this matter could be taken up at this
                                <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0448"/>point by your Department
                            directly and in a routine manner with the Iranian Postal Administration
                            rather than through diplomatic channels as was originally envisaged in
                            the Department’s letter of June 22, 1936.</p>
                        <p>In the event that your Department concurs in this point of view the
                            Department would appreciate being advised as to such action as you may
                            propose taking.</p>

                            should avoid initiating discussion of possible restrictions on
                            “offending periodicals” or suggesting other concessions which might
                            subsequently hamper the Department in making representations in behalf

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 44 of November 4, 6 P.M., to my telegram No.
                            59 of November 12, 9 A.M., and to the Department’s telegram in reply,
                            No. 46 of November 14, 3 P.M., with regard to the prohibition in Iran
                            against the delivery of American second-class mail matter.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the instructions contained in the Department’s
                            telegram last-mentioned, I sought and obtained an interview with Mr. A.
                            H. Massoud-Ansari, Chief of the Third Political Division in charge of
                            American affairs, on November 17.</p>
                        <p>After informing this official of the Department’s action in facilitating
                            the entry into the United States of Mr. Hadjeb-Davallou, and receiving
                            his thanks, I observed that the best way to avoid trouble was to
                            anticipate it, and continued that with this thought in mind I wished to
                            ask him, on an entirely personal basis, whether he could inform me when
                            subscribers in Iran to American newspapers and magazines could expect to
                            receive their publications.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Massoud-Ansari replied that this was a question about which he would
                            have to make inquiries of the competent authorities, and that he would
                            do so and let me know what the status of the question was.</p>
                        <p>I then explained that subscribers in Iran to American periodicals, among
                            whom were many Iranians and other non-Americans, had not received them
                            for about eight months, with a few unimportant exceptions. The reason I
                            asked the question, I continued, was that increasing pressure was being
                            brought upon me by subscribers in Iran to make official representations
                            respecting this matter. Those <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0450"
                            />who had spoken to me on the subject included, in addition to
                            nonofficial subscribers, the Italian Minister, the Counsellor of the
                            British Legation, the French Chargé d’Affaires, and the newly arrived
                            Swedish Minister, all of whom took American newspapers. The latter in
                            particular, who subscribed to several American publications, had been
                            considerably nonplussed to discover that he could not expect to receive
                            them in view of the present restrictions. Similarly, I said, increasing
                            pressure was being brought upon the Department of State by the
                            publishers. It was with these considerations in mind that I had thought
                            it wise, at this time, to inquire in regard to the matter in a purely
                            informal and personal manner.</p>
                        <p>The Chief of the Third Political Division listened attentively to the
                            foregoing and again promised to make informal inquiries and to let me
                            know the result.</p>
                        <p>It may be observed from the foregoing that I carefully avoided giving any
                            impression that concessions might be made respecting individual
                            publications, the delivery of which the Iranian Government might
                            consider undesirable.</p>

                        <p>24. Lutheran missionaries at Saujbulak in Azerbaijan have been ordered to
                            leave by the local governor. This morning I asked the acting Foreign
                            Minister to delay action pending full investigation and drew his
                            attention to the exchange of notes dated May 14, 1928,<note n="22"

                        <p>25. My telegram of March 24, noon. Foreign Office states that the mission
                            at Saujbulak is being expelled for continued association with
                            disaffected elements in a frontier province. It is possible that the
                            mission will be permitted to become established elsewhere. Mission was
                            given 15 days, now about to expire, to dispose of property and has asked
                            me to obtain 6 months. However, the Government desires them to depart at
                            once and arrange disposal of the property later.</p>
                        <p>Two communications received from the mission have failed to give any
                            facts or reasons which might explain action of the authorities.</p>
                        <p>I doubt if the foregoing results from any general policy to rid the
                            country of missionaries since Soheily<note n="24" xml:id="d476fn24">A.

                            Office states that it was approached in the first instance about the
                            mission by the Azerbaijan authorities, it advised to act in accordance
                            with its duties and that the mission has been under surveillance for
                            about 5 months.</p>
                        <p>Shall I make further representations or inform the mission that it should
                            work out its difficulties as well as it can.</p>

                        <p>13. Your telegrams No. 24 March 24, noon, and No. 25 March 25, 2 p.m.
                            Inadequacy of Department’s information on subject precludes sending of
                            definite instructions at this time as to appropriate action. The
                            following observations are submitted for your guidance.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of clear evidence that activities of mission personnel
                            violate condition on which permission to carry on their work was assured
                            by the exchange of notes of May 14, 1928, you should firmly urge the
                            withdrawal of order of expulsion and insist on a continued recognition
                            of the right confirmed by that agreement. If you should consider that
                            there is tenable ground for the charges made by the Iranian authorities,
                            you will refrain from any representations regarding expulsion but
                            request informally that reasonable consideration be shown the persons
                            concerned in the execution <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0452"/>of
                            the order of expulsion. If it appears likely that expulsion order will
                            be enforced, you should request a written statement by the Iranian
                            authorities of the offenses with which missionaries are charged.</p>
                        <p>As regards property of the mission your attention is invited to
                            instruction No. 596 of December 1, 1927,<note n="25" xml:id="d477fn25"
                                >Not printed.</note> from which it appears that, at that time, the
                            question of title to the property had not been clarified. If you should
                            now have reasonable evidence of the American ownership of the property
                            you should oppose any precipitate action on the part of the Iranian
                            Government which might prevent the owners from disposing of the property
                            or force them to dispose of it at a substantial sacrifice.</p>

                            to Reverend Henry Mueller of the Lutheran Orient Mission at Mehabad
                            (formerly Saujbulak), Azerbaijan, which is now in the process of
                            liquidation at the desire of the Iranian Government, it was decided at
                            the World Missionary Conference held at Edinburgh in 1910, that
                            evangelistic missionary work among the Kurds should be undertaken by the
                            Lutheran Church. Accordingly, the Lutheran Orient Mission is
                            “accredited” to the Kurds as a people, and its field of effort is
                            therefore in the areas in Iraq, Iran, and Turkey, which are inhabited by
                            Kurds. The location of the Mission in one of these countries rather than
                            in either of the other two is, therefore, governed by reasons of
                            expediency and not of principle, and as the Mission is now being sent
                            away from Kurdish territory in Iran, there is good reason to believe
                            that an attempt may be made to relocate it in Kurdish Iraq. Of course,
                            the attitude of Turkey toward Christian missionaries during the past
                            quarter-century places Kurdish Turkey fairly out of the picture.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mueller has himself mentioned such a possibility to me, adding that
                            of course the ultimate decision will be up to the home Board. It is his
                            understanding that missionary work in Iraq is regulated by treaty and he
                            appears to think that as the policy of the Iraqi <pb n="388"
                                xml:id="pg_388" facs="0453"/>Government towards the Kurds is both
                            lenient and enlightened, at least by contrast with the severe Kurdish
                            policies of the Iranian and Turkish Governments, the presence of the
                            Lutheran Mission would be welcomed by the Government of Iraq. I have
                            suggested to Mr. Mueller that he call at the American Legation at
                            Baghdad on his way home in order that he may be able to inform himself
                            not only of the cold text of a treaty, but also of the political
                            atmosphere in which missionaries carry on their work in Iraq and of any
                            special factors which might affect working in the Kurdish areas of that
                            country.</p>
                        <p>It may as well be said here that the Iranian authorities are aware of the
                            possibility that the Lutherans may become established across the
                            frontier and are disturbed at the prospect. Their information was
                            probably obtained by reading correspondence of the Lutheran Mission.
                            Iran is acutely conscious of the fact that Kurdish nationalism, while
                            perhaps not a matter of great immediate concern, may raise its head in
                            any one of the three countries in which the Kurds dwell, and it has done
                            and is doing everything possible to prevent this from happening in
                            Iranian territory. The task is rendered difficult by the indeterminate
                            nature of the frontier for although the boundary was laid down in the
                            Treaty of Erzerum of 1847,<note n="26" xml:id="d478fn26">Signed May
                                19/31, 1847, <hi rend="italic">British and Foreign State

                            is understood to have been demarcated in 1914 by Perso-Turkish
                            Commissioners, assisted by British and Russian Commissioners having
                            arbitral powers, Mr. Mueller, who has traveled through the country, says
                            that it is not possible to say where the authority of one country ends
                            and that of another commences.</p>
                        <p>I do not think that the Iranian Government suspects the Lutheran Mission
                            of political involvement in a Kurdish nationalistic movement. I do think
                            that it is entirely unsympathetic to the evangelistic and other work of
                            the Mission, on the ground that whereas the Iranian Government seeks to
                            disestablish contact between the Kurds of Iran and those of Iraq and
                            Turkey, to make them forget that they are Kurds and to realize that they
                            are primarily Iranians—in a word, to wear down and finally to obliterate
                            the differences between the Kurds and the Iranians—on the other hand,
                            the work of the Mission serves to emphasize and deepen the differences
                            which already exist. If the Mission does not actually foment Kurdish
                            nationalism, at least it tends to prepare the soil for its growth. Mr.
                            Mueller fully appreciates this point of view and, indeed, does not blame
                            the Iranian Government in the least for desiring to see the Mission
                            depart. He appears to realize that there is a fundamental conflict
                            between the purposes of the Mission and those of the Government, and
                            that the latter has the secular power to eliminate those who oppose its
                            aims, which it is quite within its rights to utilize.</p>
                        <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0454"/>
                        <p>Mr. Mueller, it may be added, has the greatest admiration for the Kurds,
                            whom he describes as a proud, simple, vigorous, clean-living mountain
                            people. According to him, the policy adopted by the Iranian and Turkish
                            Governments towards the Kurds within their borders have been severely
                            oppressive. They have been continuously harried and thousands, even some
                            women, have been shot. On the contrary, the Iraqi Government, while
                            maintaining a firm hand, has encouraged the Kurds as a people, and
                            desires to see them advance and develop as such. For this reason, many
                            Iranian Kurds have emigrated to the Iraqi side.</p>

                            Mission at Mehabad (Saujbulak), and to inform the Department that
                            Messrs. Henry and Clarence Mueller<note n="28" xml:id="d479fn28"
                                >Assistant to the Reverend Henry Mueller.</note> called at the
                            Legation on June 27, 1936, to discuss the present state of affairs.</p>
                        <p>It appears that no word has come from the side of the Government in
                            regard to the purchase of the property. Mr. Henry Mueller had consulted
                            an attorney, Mr. Javad Mahin, an alumnus of the American High School
                            (now Alborz College at Teheran), who apparently informed Mr. Mueller
                            that he need not expect any difficulty over the title to the property
                            from the Iranian Government, which would doubtless accept a statement
                            from the American Legation to the effect that the Lutheran Mission had
                            owned the property at Saujbulak for a certain number of years. The
                            Government, Mr. Mahin thought, would place great importance on the
                            circumstance that despite any technical doubts about the title which
                            might exist, the Mission had consistently been in possession of the
                            property as a Mission. Mr. Mahin had emphasized, however, that it was
                            necessary to have someone pushing the matter through the Government, and
                            he suggested that the Legation might do this, particularly if a written
                            statement could be obtained from the Government that it agreed in
                            principle to buy the property, and the missionaries could then leave
                            Iran.</p>
                        <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0455"/>
                        <p>The Messrs. Mueller were informed that the Legation could not issue any
                            statement of the kind he described if such should be desired by the
                            Iranian Government. To the suggestion that it would probably be
                            sufficient if the Consulate furnished a statement, it was replied that
                            the Consulate would doubtless take a similar position. It was pointed
                            out that neither the Legation nor the Consulate could certify to
                            anything that was not within their direct knowledge, and that as regards
                            the Saujbulak property they would have to take the word of the
                            missionaries, which could equally well be given to the Government
                            directly. If the Government required evidence of use and ownership, this
                            could be furnished by Government officials at Saujbulak and by friends
                            of the Mission residing there.</p>
                        <p>The Messrs. Mueller were also informed that the Legation would be quite
                            unable to handle the purchase of the Mission property by the Government.
                            This was a private matter between the Lutheran Mission on one side and
                            the Government on the other, and the Legation could not enter into the
                            affair unless injustice were done. It was emphasized to them once more
                            that so far as the Legation was aware, the Government was under no
                            obligation whatever to purchase the property, and could hardly be
                            expected to commit itself in advance in this respect. I gave it as my
                            personal opinion that it would be best for them to employ reliable legal
                            counsel and to remain in Teheran until the matter should be settled, and
                            that the results probably would not be satisfactory if they should leave
                            the country and leave the affairs of the Mission in the hands of an
                            attorney.</p>

                            Government. In this relation, you may point out that the United States
                            has extradition treaties with almost all of the countries of the world
                            excepting Persia, and that it is very desirous of concluding such a

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 639 of November 29, 1935<note n="31" xml:id="d483fn31">Not
                                printed.</note> and to report as follows:</p>
                        <p>On December 5 at the German Legation I met Dr. Ahmad Matine Daftary,
                            Under Secretary of the Iranian Ministry of Justice. He informed me that
                            he had been commissioned by the Foreign Office to discuss the proposed
                            treaty of extradition between the United States and Iran.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary called my attention to the International Conference
                            for the Unification of Penal Laws at Copenhagen and asserted that his
                            Government would prefer in principle to enter into extradition treaty
                            negotiations along the lines of the projects adopted by this body in
                            1931, 1933, and 1935 in Paris, Madrid and Copenhagen, respectively. He
                            added that his Government would be quite willing to consider any special
                            clauses that the United States might desire to incorporate in such a
                            treaty. It might be mentioned in connection with the above suggestion
                            that Ahmad Matine Daftary was a delegate to the International Conference
                            for the Unification of Penal Laws at Copenhagen and was elected
                            Vice-President of the organization.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Under Secretary if the Department of Justice had any
                            objection of a vital character to the draft which was submitted to the
                            Foreign Office by the American government. He reluctantly admitted that
                            Sections 5 and 25, pertaining to bigamy and crimes against the laws for
                            the suppression of traffic in narcotics, appeared to be rather out of
                            harmony with Iranian law on these subjects. In answer to this objection
                            I pointed out the saving clause in Article 1, but suggested that my
                            Government had no intention or desire to insist upon the exact wording
                            of the draft submitted and that I should be very <pb n="393"
                                xml:id="pg_393" facs="0458"/>glad indeed to have him revise the
                            sections which he had mentioned and that I would then submit the revised
                            draft to the Department of State for rejection or approval.</p>
                        <p>To the above suggestion the Under Secretary urged that his Government
                            would prefer the draft made by the International Conference for the
                            Unification of Penal Laws. I asked him if I might have a copy of the
                            proposed draft for submission to the Department and he replied that if I
                            would send Mr. Saleh, Legation Interpreter, to his Ministry on the
                            following day that he would be pleased to furnish a copy and to explain
                            to him in Persian what he had explained to me in his imperfect
                            English.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. Saleh called, Mr. Daftary was unable to find a printed copy, but
                            was able to furnish the enclosed rough draft<note n="32"
                                xml:id="d483fn32">Not printed. This draft is the same as that found

                            projects of this character which he asserted had received the approval
                            of the Conference. His explanation of the position of his Ministry to
                            Mr. Saleh coincided with the explanation which he had given to me at the
                            German Legation.</p>
                        <p>A few days later while calling at the Foreign Office on another matter I
                            brought up the subject of my conversation with Mr. Ahmad Matine Daftary.
                            I informed the Acting Minister that while I would of course be more than
                            pleased to forward the draft which Mr. Daftary had submitted, I was
                            rather of the opinion that much time could be saved in the event that
                            the Department’s draft could be revised in keeping with the views of the
                            Ministry of Justice. To this suggestion the Acting Minister appeared to
                            be in accord, and he assured me that he would discuss the matter again
                            with Mr. Daftary and ask him to revise and transmit to the Legation the
                            draft which I had previously presented to the Foreign Office. This has
                            not yet been received, but I am enclosing herewith the French text of
                            the rather imperfect draft offered by the Ministry of Justice as of
                            possible interest to the Department.</p>

                            December 12, 1935, in regard to the proposed extradition treaty between
                            the United States and Iran. You enclose the French text of a counter
                            draft of the proposed treaty supplied by the Under Secretary of the
                            Iranian Ministry <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0459"/>of Justice,
                            who informed you that this draft is in accordance with the proposal
                            adopted by the International Conference for the Unification of Penal
                            laws. You added that at your suggestion the Acting Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs has apparently agreed to the submission to you of specific
                            suggestions for the amendment of the draft treaty which the Department
                            proposed.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that you will receive at an early date the suggested revision
                            of the Department’s draft especially as the draft submitted by the Under
                            Secretary of the Ministry of Justice is unsatisfactory to this
                            Government in several important particulars and represents a wide
                            variance from the extradition treaties which the United States has
                            concluded with almost all of the countries of the world.</p>
                        <p>For your information the draft you forwarded is unsatisfactory in the
                            following important respects: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>It omits a list of extraditable crimes and offenses, which list

                                    standpoint of definiteness and certainty;</p>
                                <p>It does not provide for the production of evidence making out a

                                    is requested;</p>
                                <p>It does not provide for the mechanics of the procedure involved
                                    in case of extradition. Such a provision is regarded as
                                    necessary under the laws of the United States;</p>
                                <p>It limits unduly the definition of political offenses, and,</p>
                                <p>It provides that a contracting party which refuses to surrender
                                    one of its nationals must place him on trial for the offense
                                    committed abroad. Under its system of jurisprudence the United
                                    States could not carry out such an obligation.</p>

                        <p>Referring to statements contained in your despatch, the Department
                            advises you that if the Iranian Government so desires, the United States
                            would be willing to omit bigamy from the list of extraditable crimes.
                            However, it is hoped that it may be possible to include therein crimes
                            against the laws for the suppression of the traffic in narcotics, and

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your despatch No. 659 of
                            December 25, 1935, with which you enclosed a note from the Under
                            Secretary for Foreign Affairs<note n="35" xml:id="d485fn35">Neither
                                printed.</note> suggesting that the proposed extradition treaty
                            between the <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0460"/>United States and
                            Iran be based upon proposals for such treaties heretofore adopted by the
                            International Conference for the Unification of Penal laws.</p>
                        <p>Reference is made to the Department’s instruction No. 182 of January 23,
                            1936, wherein it was indicated that the proposal in question would not
                            be satisfactory from the standpoint of the United States on which to
                            base an extradition treaty of this Government.</p>
                        <p>With its instruction No. 271 of March 20, 1934, the Department sent to
                            your Legation a draft of a proposed treaty of extradition and stated
                            that it would give consideration to any changes in the draft submitted
                            which may be proposed by the Government to which you are accredited. You
                            telegraphed on April 17, 1934, that you were advised by the Chief of the
                            Treaty Division of the Persian Government that his Government was ready
                            to negotiate a treaty of extradition but reserved the right to make
                            changes in the draft submitted.</p>
                        <p>The Department has not since been informed as to any specific changes
                            which the Government of Iran desired to make in the draft treaty which
                            you submitted but is confronted at this late date with a proposal that
                            the treaty be based on a very different draft and one which is entirely
                            unacceptable to this Government.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing it is considered that the Iranian Government
                            should submit such changes as it desires to make in the draft which the
                            Department submitted, and it is hoped that you will be able to bring
                            about such action at an early date.<note n="36" xml:id="d485fn36">The
                                Iranian Government, however, submitted no changes to the draft as
                                suggested by the Department. It was equally unresponsive to
                                inquiries made by the Department in January 1937 and April
                                1938.</note></p>

                            of the Convention, and of the Regulations which have been issued by the
                            Iranian Government to give effect to the agreement in this country.</p>
                        <p>Article XVII reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Export certificates shall not be granted with respect to Iranian
                                    merchandise exported to Germany. Permits for the entry of German
                                    merchandise into Iran shall be granted without presentation, in
                                    counterpart, of export certificates.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>For the system of export certificates and import permits which applies to
                            the foreign trade of Iran with the generality of countries, including
                            the United States, there is substituted, with respect to the trade with
                            Germany, a system of certificates of origin and import compensation
                            permits. No discrimination of importance would arise in case the system
                            last-mentioned operated in the same manner as the export
                            certificate-import permit system which applies to the United States and
                            to other countries except Germany.</p>
                        <p>The following differences, however, appear to exist: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>American exports are admitted to Iran subject to the
                                    production of import permits; these permits are based upon
                                    export certificates showing the prior export of Iranian products
                                    of at least equivalent value. German exports to Iran are not
                                    subject to these requirements.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>For import permits covering American exports to Iran a
                                    percentage, now 15%, of the value of the invoices must be paid,
                                    whereas it does not appear that an equivalent charge is exacted
                                    for “import compensation permits” issued under the terms of the
                                    Irano-German convention.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Import permits for American exports to Iran are issued only up
                                    to 85% of the value of the export certificates produced, whereas
                                    no such limitation is imposed on German exports to Iran.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>From press accounts of the Irano-German Convention which have come to the
                            attention of the Legation, there is a strong likelihood that an
                            undivulged subsidiary agreement has been reached between the Iranian and
                            German Governments by which the trade of these two countries is to
                            proceed by barter. In consequence, it is believed that this trade is
                            intended to balance, although the Convention contains no specific
                            provision that it should do so.</p>
                        <p>The actual handicap under which American trade and the trade of other
                            countries suffers as compared with German trade is probably <pb n="397"
                                xml:id="pg_397" facs="0462"/>not serious, an opinion which is
                            supported by the fact that no American exporters to Iran, or Iranian
                            importers of American goods, have thus far indicated to the Legation any
                            sign of displeasure at the terms of the Convention. The reason for their
                            lack of interest may perhaps be found in the circumstances that a large
                            proportion of the imports from Germany into Iran is not commercial
                            imports in the ordinary sense, but consists of machinery and equipment
                            for the Government and for the establishment of Iranian industries.</p>
                        <p>A question of principle, however, is involved, and the Legation is
                            informed that on this basis the Belgian, British, Czechoslovak and
                            French Legations in Teheran have been instructed by their respective
                            Governments to make representations to the Iranian Government. A copy of
                            the British note to the Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs is enclosed
                                herewith.<note n="39" xml:id="d486fn39">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It may be noted that Article XVII of the Convention is easily terminable
                            under the terms of Article XVIII. There is attached a suggested
                                draft<note n="39" xml:id="d486fn41">Not printed.</note> of a note to
                            the Iranian Foreign Minister which is respectfully submitted for the
                            Department’s approval. It is more specific than the British note, which
                            may be thought to err on the side of over-simplicity.</p>
                        <p>Before the present despatch was typed, the Legation sent the draft to
                            Vice Consul Crain for his comments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Crain questioned whether there is not a possibility that importers of
                            German goods may have to pay for “import compensation permits” a sum
                            corresponding to the 15% charge for import permits, which does not
                            appear in the regulations. The Legation agrees that undisclosed
                            stipulations may exist which either compensate for or narrow the field
                            of the discrimination, but it seems to have no choice but to base its
                            conclusions and recommendations upon the known terms of agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Crain adds: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Iranian defense, if any is offered, for not charging 15% of
                                    the invoice value in the case of importers of German goods may
                                    be that exporters of Iranian goods to Germany do not receive the
                                    bounty which exporters receive in the case of exports to other
                                    countries.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This point appears to be well taken. The Iranian Government might say:
                            “We do not have to charge 15% of the invoice value of imports because we
                            do not have to pay 10% of the value of exports.” It might even go so far
                            as to add: “We do not have to operate this system with respect to our
                            trade with Germany because that trade is in balance.” The answer to the
                            first statement would seem to be that notwithstanding any principle of
                            compensation involved, i. e., if we pay a bounty <pb n="398"
                                xml:id="pg_398" facs="0463"/>on our exports the money must come from
                            somewhere, and it might as well come from imports, the system places a
                            handicap upon American exports to Iran to which German exports are not
                            subject. The second statement would amount to an absurdity so far as the
                            trade with the United States is concerned because the balance of that
                            trade is favorable to Iran.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Crain agrees that as a matter of principle we should present our
                            views to the Foreign Office.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to Mr. Hornibrook’s
                            despatch No. 737, dated March 6, 1936, regarding apparent discrimination
                            against American trade arising from the Convention for the Regulation of
                            Payments between Germany and Iran which was signed on October 15, 1935.
                            It has been noted that protests in this connection have been made to the
                            Iranian Government by the Belgian, British, Czechoslovak and French
                            legations on behalf of their respective governments and that the
                            Legation suggests that similar action be taken by this Government.</p>
                        <p>According to the terms of the convention in question the Department
                            understands that importers of goods from Germany receive import permits
                            without being obliged to produce export certificates, such as are
                            required in the case of imports from the United States. This would
                            appear to place German goods in a more favored position than those of
                            the United States and hence to constitute discrimination against
                            American trade contrary to the terms of the Provisional Agreement with
                            reference to Commercial Relations between the United States and Iran,
                            effected by the exchange of notes of May 14, 1928.<note n="40"

                        <p>Unless you perceive some compelling reason to the contrary, therefore,
                            you are authorized to communicate these views in writing to the Iranian
                            Government and state that this Government trusts the Iranian Government
                            will give this matter its sympathetic consideration and will at the
                            earliest opportunity take appropriate measures to remove the present
                            apparent discrimination against imports from the United States. The
                            Department is of the opinion that a note drafted along these lines is
                            preferable to the rather detailed draft submitted with your despatch
                            under acknowledgement.</p>
                        <p>In taking action on this matter you will, of course, give due
                            consideration to such results as may have attended the protests lodged
                            by <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0464"/>the Belgian, British,
                            Czechoslovak and French legations. This is also a matter concerning
                            which the Department expects that you will keep it fully advised.</p>
                        <p>There is enclosed for your information a copy of a memorandum<note n="41"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Legation’s despatch No. 737 of March 6, 1936, and to the Department’s
                            instruction No. 233 of July 20, 1936, with reference to the apparent
                            discrimination against United States trade with Iran which arises from
                            Article 17 of the Irano-German Convention of October 30, 1935.</p>
                        <p>Communication of the Department’s views was delayed for a certain time,
                            partly in view of the somewhat strained state of existing relations. It
                            was thought that when the Irano-German Convention was published by the
                            Iranian Government, it might be found that at the time of ratification
                            alterations were made which would take into account the discrimination
                            to which attention had already been called by communications from the
                            British and a few other Legations. However, the Convention has not yet
                            appeared in any official publication, and communication of our views for
                            the reason mentioned can scarcely be postponed any longer.</p>
                        <p>A more recent consideration has been the new situation arising from the
                            law of November 8, 1936, which made certain changes with regard to the
                            issuance of export certificates and import permits, which were in effect
                            favorable to American trade. The question arose whether sufficient
                            practical discrimination remained to justify a communication.</p>
                        <p>An exchange of memoranda has recently taken place between the Legation
                            and the Consulate for the purpose of clarifying this point, from which
                            it would appear that while the more obvious price disadvantages incurred
                            by American goods as compared with German goods seem to be largely
                            offset in one way or another, the complicated procedure and the delays
                            and deposits required with respect to American goods in connection with
                            the necessity of obtaining import <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400"
                                facs="0465"/>permits are still substantial. Accordingly, a
                            communication in the sense of the Department’s instruction is being
                            communicated to the Iranian Foreign Minister. A copy is enclosed
                            herewith.</p>
                        <p>There are also enclosed herewith copies of the memoranda<note n="42"
                                xml:id="d488fn42">Neither printed.</note> to which reference has
                            been made.</p>
                        <p>According to the Commercial Secretary at the British Legation, the
                            replies received to the communication of several Legations calling
                            attention to the apparent discrimination arising from Article 17 are to
                            the effect that there is no discrimination because Iran is prepared to
                            enter into similar agreements with other countries. The British Legation
                            referred the question of entering upon negotiations for a clearing
                            convention to the Foreign Office. According to the same source,
                            Czechoslovakia is definitely uninterested in such an agreement. Czech
                            heavy industry is busy with armament orders, and if Iran does not wish
                            to trade except on a compensation basis there are ample markets
                            elsewhere.</p>

                                under instructions from the Department of State at Washington, to
                                draw Your Excellency’s attention to the terms of the Convention for
                                the Regulation of Payments between Iran and Germany which was signed
                                on October 30, 1935.</p>
                            <p>According to the terms of the Convention, importers of goods from
                                Germany apparently receive import permits without being obliged to
                                produce export certificates, such as are required in the case of
                                imports from the United States. This would appear to place German
                                goods in a more favored position than those of the United States and
                                hence to constitute discrimination against American trade contrary
                                to the terms of the Provisional Agreement with reference to
                                Commercial Relations between the United States and Iran, effected by
                                exchange of notes on May 14, 1928.</p>

                            respective Governments.</p>
                        <p>The provisions of the draft treaty are for the most part similar to those
                            which have been included in treaties between the United States and other
                            countries. The following explanations and comments regarding certain
                            provisions may be of assistance to you in your consideration of the
                            draft treaty.</p>
                        <p>Article I. In connection with the reference in this article to the
                            conclusion of a consular convention, I may inform you that the United
                            States Government is prepared to undertake negotiations for such a
                            convention at any time after the present treaty shall have been
                            concluded.</p>
                        <p>Article IX. This article would extend to the United States and its
                            nationals the assurances given by Iraq in Article 12 of its Declaration
                            to the Council of the League of Nations.<note n="3" xml:id="d489fn3">May

                            the King of Iraq with the concurrence of His Britannic Majesty. The
                            corresponding procedure in the case of the United States would be the
                            selection of American legal experts by His Majesty the King with the
                            concurrence of the President of the United States.</p>
                        <p>In respect to this particular point I should be glad to receive from Your
                            Excellency, in writing, a confirmation of this understanding on the part
                            of the Iraqi Government.</p>
                        <p>Articles XV to XVIII include provisions regarding naturalization which in
                            certain respects would appear to be in conflict with Iraqi law. However,
                            it is hoped and believed that a solution of this seeming difficulty may
                            be found, and with this object in view I shall hope to discuss the
                            matter with you at your convenience.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the provisions of Articles XX, XXI, and XXIII
                            regarding the treatment to be accorded by each Party to goods
                            originating in the territory of the other, it should be understood that
                            these provisions are not construed by the United States Government as
                            affecting the right of either Party to adopt measures to counteract
                            dumping, bounties, undervaluation or unfair methods or acts in foreign
                            trade, so long as such measures are applicable under like circumstances
                            and conditions in respect of trade with every foreign country. In other
                            words, the levying of antidumping or countervailing (anti-bounty)
                            duties, or additional duties for undervaluation, or the prohibition of
                            the importation of dumped, bounty-fed, or undervalued goods, or goods
                            involved in unfair trade practices, is not regarded as inconsistent with
                            the obligations imposed by the most favored nation clause or with the
                            provisions against the imposition or [<hi rend="italic">of?</hi>]
                            prohibitions or restrictions on the importation of merchandise.</p>
                        <p>Article XXVI provides for national and most favored nation treatment in
                            regard to tonnage dues and other port charges on vessels as
                            distinguished from duties on their cargoes. This means that an Iraqi
                            vessel entering a port of the United States, or an American vessel
                            entering a port of Iraq, from any given foreign port would be entitled
                            to as favorable treatment in regard to such charges as national vessels
                            or those of any third state entering from the same foreign port. Under
                            the laws of the United States vessels of all nationalities, including
                            American, pay tonnage dues at the rate of two cents per ton when
                            entering ports of the United States from certain nearby foreign ports,
                            whereas such vessels entering from any other foreign port pay tonnage
                            dues at the rate of six cents per ton. Thus the six cent rate is
                            applicable to all vessels, including American, coming from Iraq and from
                            all other countries except the nearby countries specified in the
                            statute. Article XXVI of the enclosed <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403"
                                facs="0468"/>draft treaty should not, therefore, be construed as
                            requiring the United States to extend the application of the lower rate
                            to vessels coming from Iraq.</p>
                        <p>The reservations throughout this draft treaty regarding the Panama Canal
                            Zone, the Philippine Islands and other dependencies of the United
                            States, and Cuba, are customary provisions in treaties of the United
                            States. On the other hand it will be noted that paragraphs (<hi

                                rend="italic">d</hi>) of Article XXXI contain the substance of the
                            reservations included by Iraq in Part 2 of Article 11 of its Declaration
                            to the Council of the League of Nations.</p>
                        <p>In submitting the enclosed draft treaty for the consideration of the
                            Iraqi Government, it should be understood that my Government reserves
                            the right to propose changes in the draft treaty at any time throughout
                            the negotiations.</p>

                            that the draft treaty of general relations enclosed in your letter No.
                            43 dated July 25, 1933, which you were kind enough to send to this
                            Ministry, has been under very careful consideration.</p>
                        <p>This Ministry, in spite of its desire to expedite a reply, was unable to
                            avoid the long delay which has occurred, owing to the variety of
                            subjects dealt with in the draft.</p>
                        <p>These subjects concern different departments of the Iraq Government which
                            it has been necessary to consult in order to obtain their views.
                            Moreover certain provisions of the draft affecting as they do the
                            domestic laws of this country required close examination by legal
                            experts.</p>
                        <p>Although some provisions are still under consideration particularly from
                            the point of view of the developing policy of the Iraqi Government, this
                            Ministry holds the view, following upon oral discussions last week, that
                            the most convenient mode of proceeding would be to divide the
                            subject-matter of the draft into several categories. This would conduce
                            to an earlier conclusion of this matter.</p>
                        <p>This Ministry would be glad to learn your Government’s views about the
                            division of the draft into several categories.</p>

                            1936, from the Iraqi Foreign Office containing its observations on the
                            draft treaty of general relations submitted by this Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department is prepared to negotiate three separate treaties with
                            reference to commerce and navigation, general relations (residence and
                            establishment), and naturalization, respectively. It believes that a
                            treaty of commerce and navigation is most important at this time, and
                            accordingly desires to begin negotiations looking toward the conclusion
                            of such a treaty first.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that on pages 5 and 6 of the memorandum of your interview
                            with the Director General of the Foreign Office on July 15, 1935,<note
                                n="7" xml:id="d491fn8">Not printed.</note> you express doubt as to
                            the advisability of proposing negotiations for a commercial treaty owing
                            to the fact that the Iraqi Government is considering the adoption of a
                            new trade policy. An examination of the possible objections of the Iraqi
                            Government reported in your later despatch under reference, leads to the
                            conclusion that the objections are specific in nature and not
                            general.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to ascertain whether a proposal for the negotiation of
                            a commercial treaty would meet with the concurrence of the Iraqi
                            Government. Negotiations for a treaty of residence and establishment
                            could follow, and the naturalization treaty would be last in order.</p>
                        <p>For your information the Department desires to point out that in the
                            negotiation of a commercial treaty it must insist upon the inclusion of
                            an article providing for unconditional most-favored-nation treatment, a
                            principle to which this Government is firmly committed. To conclude a
                            commercial treaty without the unconditional most-favored-nation clause
                            would not only be futile but even prejudicial to American interests.</p>

                        <p>Despite the reports which have reached us of the increasingly
                            satisfactory conditions in Liberia there has been, during the past year
                            or so, a series of books, news stories and statements by various persons
                            all tending to disparage Liberia and the Liberians and to paint a gloomy
                            picture of the Republic’s present and future. Last year Prime Minister
                            Hertzog of South Africa suggested publicly that Liberia be delivered to
                            Germany as a mandated territory—other suggestions to the same effect
                            have been attributed to European sources, <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408"
                                facs="0473"/>and that solution to the “Liberian problem” has been
                            suggested in a recent book by two British journalists. This propaganda,
                            for such it may be termed, against Liberia has naturally occasioned
                            considerable concern among the Americo-Liberians and among friends of
                            Liberia in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The concern felt in Liberia has been expressed by President Barclay in
                            recent conversations with both the American Minister and the American
                            Chargé at Monrovia. On November 26, 1936, Mr. Wharton, our Chargé at
                            Monrovia, telegraphed that in a recent conversation “Barclay asked me
                            formally what would be my Government’s attitude should there possibly be
                            some foreign aggression against Liberia”. Mr. Wharton replied that he
                            was not in a position to answer the question. The President then
                            remarked that “he is fully cognizant of our neutrality law and policy
                            but feels that if my Government issues statement that she would look
                            with disfavor on any hostile act against Liberia, position of his
                            Government would be greatly strengthened.”</p>
                        <p>While it would not seem to be desirable at this juncture to issue any
                            public statement of our attitude towards an aggression against Liberia,
                            it is suggested that there are two steps which we might probably take
                            which would be of practical benefit to Liberia and would not involve us
                            in any action contrary to our general policy to undertake no commitments
                            on the African continent single-handed:</p>
                        <p>(1) The British declined last year to join with us in recognizing Liberia
                            because of the unsettled Kru problem.<note n="6" xml:id="d497fn6">See
                                note from the British Ambassador, May 20, 1935, <ref

                                    946</ref>.</note> In view of the recent apparently satisfactory
                            settlement of this problem and the commendable progress which Liberia
                            has made during the past year and a half in putting her own house in
                            order, the Department might informally bring these facts to the
                            attention of the British Government, possibly through the British
                            Embassy here, and inquire what the present attitude of the British is
                            towards recognition.</p>
                        <p>Our close cooperation with the British in Liberian matters in the past
                            would make it not inappropriate for us to address such a friendly
                            question to them. If by such action we can encourage the British to
                            recognize the Barclay Government, it would, it is believed, go a long
                            way towards strengthening Liberia’s international position and would
                            undoubtedly further encourage Barclay to continue the constructive work
                            he has begun. In this connection it may be noted that our Chargé at
                            Monrovia recently reported that his British colleague had intimated to
                            him that he favored recognition by Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>(2) During the period of friction between the Firestone interests and
                            Liberia we quite properly refused all of Mr. Firestone’s requests <pb
                                n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0474"/>that a cruiser be sent to
                            Monrovia to enforce his claims against the Government. Now, however,
                            that normal and apparently friendly relations have been established
                            between Firestone and the Liberian Government and since there are no
                            outstanding differences between Liberia and the United States, it is
                            suggested that a friendly visit of an American warship to Monrovia might
                            serve a very useful purpose for both countries.</p>
                        <p>I am told that nearly every naval vessel sent to Europe on a shakedown
                            cruise is routed by the Azores. From the Azores to Monrovia is only four
                            or five days steaming, so for one of our ships to continue its cruise to
                            Monrovia would involve comparatively little additional time or expense.
                            It is my understanding that no American naval vessel has visited Liberia
                            since 1928.</p>

                        <p>Today after the receipt of Monrovia’s telegram No. 44, December 15, 9
                            a.m., reporting in confidence that Great Britain would recognize Liberia
                            on December 16 at 11 a.m., Mr. Dunn<note n="7" xml:id="d499fn7">Chief of
                                the Division of Western European Affairs.</note> telephoned Mr.

                                Secretary of the British Embassy.</note> at the British Embassy. Mr.
                            Dunn recalled to Mr. Broadmead that last year the British had declined
                            our suggestion that they recognize Liberia on the ground that their
                            public opinion demanded that they await a settlement of the Kru
                            question. Mr. Dunn then said that according to our reports the Kru
                            question had now been satisfactorily settled by the surrender of Chief
                            Nimley, and that we had heard rumors that the British were therefore
                            about to recognize Liberia; that the American Government would be very
                            glad to hear that this was true.</p>
                        <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0475"/>
                        <p>Mr. Broadmead replied that the Embassy had received a copy of an
                            instruction to the British representative in Monrovia directing him to
                            present his credentials as Chargé d’Affaires, but that the Embassy had
                            received no instructions from the Foreign Office to so inform the State
                            Department. Mr. Broadmead confirmed the foregoing in a subsequent
                            telephone call to Mr. Dunn, and said that the Foreign Office instruction
                            to Monrovia was dated November 17.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the foregoing conversation will tend to remind the
                            British of our interest in Liberia, and that we noticed in this instance
                            their failure to keep us informed of their attitudes towards Liberia as
                            we had them of ours in the past.</p>

                            recognition of the Liberian Government by the American Government in
                            1935, failure of the British Government to take similar action has been
                            a source of irritation and unconcealed resentment among the Liberian
                            people. The right (moral or otherwise) of one member of the comity of
                            nations to withhold diplomatic recognition from another member, based
                            primarily or solely upon the existence of a revolt against organized

                            challenged and disputed by Liberians of all walks of life. It will be
                            noted that in presenting his credentials the British Chargé d’Affaires

                            Britain harbors no imperialistic ambitions to deprive Liberians of their
                            political and territorial integrity; (2) that the British Government’s
                            latest diplomatic gesture presages the position it, in all
                            probabilities, would take if any power in or out of the League of
                            Nations served notice or manifested a desire to carry on a campaign of
                            aggression against the Republic of Liberia; (3) that as long as the
                            American Government continues its traditional policy of giving the
                            Liberian Government moral support in any whole-hearted endeavor to
                            establish needy [<hi rend="italic">needed?</hi>] reforms throughout the
                            Republic, and the Governments of Great Britain and France maintain their
                            present policy of friendliness and amity, there is little likelihood or
                            danger of the sovereignty and autonomy of the Liberian people being
                            seriously threatened.</p>

                        <p>It is at least questionable whether this Government should, as suggested

                            textiles imported into the French Zone of Morocco. It is true, as WE
                            points out, that our exports of textiles average only about $25,000 to
                            $30,000 annually. However, the following considerations should, I
                            believe, be taken into account:</p>

                            the imposition of a quota on textiles imported into Morocco which is
                            designed to shut out Japanese competition in consideration of the
                            alleged advantages we have received as a result of the discriminatory
                            quotas imposed in the British West Indies which have greatly restricted
                            sales of Japanese textiles in those markets.</p>

                                    many instances in its relations with non-British countries. It
                                    is proposed to hand to the British Ambassador, in the near
                                    future, a memorandum setting forth the implications of such a

                        <p>3. Our acquiescence in the textile quotas might well be interpreted by
                            the Japanese, who have gone a long way to cooperate with this Government
                            by the “voluntary” restriction of exports of textiles to the United
                            States and the Philippines<note n="6" xml:id="d502fn6">See <ref

                            United States, as an unfriendly act.</p>
                        <p>4. The ostensible reason for changes in the tariff regime in Morocco is
                            the need of increased customs revenue. Although moderate increases in
                            the duties on certain products for which the demand in Morocco is fairly
                            inelastic may be expected to augment the customs <pb n="414"
                                xml:id="pg_414" facs="0479"/>revenue, it is difficult to see how
                            import quotas would contribute to that result. It would appear,
                            therefore, that the quotas are proposed by France and Great Britain
                            solely as a means of gaining competitive advantages in the Moroccan
                            market.</p>
                        <p>5. It is by no means clear that the United States, as contrasted with
                            certain branches of our textile industry, has benefited by the
                            discriminatory quota against Japanese textiles in the British West
                            Indies. Textiles—mainly of cotton—are necessary imports, used by the
                            farm and labor sections of the populations. If they are forced by a
                            discriminatory quota to pay considerably more for their cotton goods,
                            they must either buy less of cotton goods or less of imported foodstuns
                            and manufactured products (other than textiles) than they would be able
                            to buy in the absence of such a quota. A greater portion of the
                            country’s available foreign exchange is required for textile imports if
                            the volume of such imports is maintained. Consequently, any gains in
                            exports of textiles may well be at the expense of other products of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The effects of the quota may be delayed for some time while stocks of
                            Japanese textiles last.</p>
                        <p>6. Merely because our interest in the textile trade in Morocco is small,
                            it does not necessarily follow that the proposed textile quota would not
                            injure United States trade with Morocco, for the reasons given under 5
                            above.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above considerations, it is suggested that the proposed
                            reply be changed so as to eliminate the acquiescence in the proposed
                            textile quota. The reply would then reaffirm our position that the quota
                            system, being inherently discriminatory, is one which this Government
                            would not be willing to agree to in the case of Morocco, but that this
                            Government is willing, in view of the need of the Moroccan Government
                            for increased revenue, to agree to moderate tariff increases on a
                            selected list of products.</p>
                        <p>If, despite tariff increases, a case could be made for quota
                            restrictions, consideration might be given to acquiescing in quotas
                            based on a period or periods which would not result in flagrant
                            discriminations as between the several supplying countries, as a
                            temporary trade control measure.</p>

                            questions he brought up on his visit to the Department on February 12,
                            as set forth in a memorandum of that date<note n="9" xml:id="d503fn9"

                        <p>This memorandum brought up the subject of the Dahirs which have been
                            issued in the Spanish and French Zones of Morocco affecting the
                            importation of various articles from abroad into those zones. The
                            Minister stated that in the opinion of his Government many of these
                            Dahirs resulted in discriminations against the importation of foreign
                            products in favor of French or Spanish products according to the
                            particular zone in which the Dahir went into effect. He asked whether we
                            had had occasion to make any protest against the operation of these
                            Dahirs.</p>
                        <p>I informed the Minister of the action we had taken with regard to these
                            Dahirs along the following lines, and further informed the Minister that
                            any later information which came to light in this relation we would be
                            glad to give him:</p>
                        <p>The Diplomatic Agent at Tangier has been active in protesting, under
                            instructions from the Department of State, to the Protectorate
                            authorities of Morocco against their violations of the letter and the
                            spirit of the Moroccan treaties. Twenty-four such violations have been
                            noted since 1930. In fact, because of Mr. Blake’s long service in
                            Tangier, and because the United States has never waived its capitulatory
                            rights in Morocco, it may be said that the American Diplomatic Agent in
                            that country has taken the lead in opposing infringement upon the rights
                            of the United States, and by implication, upon the rights of the other
                            nations signatory of the Act of Algeciras.<note n="10" xml:id="d503fn10"

                        <p>On November 9, 1934, the Chief of the Western European Division (Mr.
                            Moffat) gave the Chargé d’Affaires of the Netherlands an accurate
                            summary of this Government’s position with respect to Morocco when he
                            said, in substance, that from our point of view the essence of the
                            Moroccan question is the maintenance of the “open door” in that
                                country.<note n="11" xml:id="d503fn11"><ref

                        <p>We do not uncompromisingly oppose any change in the existing regime; in
                            fact, we have already suggested that a higher tariff on goods entering
                            Morocco would not be an unacceptable solution to the financial problems
                            said to be confronting the Protectorate authorities. We have always
                            held, however, that the parties to the Act of Algeciras should be
                            consulted and that each Power should acquiesce before any change is made
                            in the customs regime in Morocco.</p>
                        <p>The Department is engaged at the present time in studying the question of
                            its present and future relations with Morocco. It is hoped that this
                            study will be concluded within a few weeks. We will then be in a
                            position to discuss these matters further with the Netherlands
                            Minister.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit to the
                            Department herewith an English translation of a dahir dated January 2,
                                1936,<note n="12" xml:id="d504fn12">Not printed.</note> which
                            purports to regulate the importation of, and trade in, carpets and rugs
                            in the French Zone of Morocco, and I also enclose a copy of a note<note
                                n="12" xml:id="d504fn13">Not printed.</note> addressed to the French
                            Resident General, by this Diplomatic Agency, on the subject.</p>
                        <p>I do not doubt that the Department will concur in my view that we should
                            cooperate, as far as possible, with the Protectorate Government, in all
                            proper measures to defend Moorish native industries from the effects of
                            unfair competition. It was therefore only after the most careful
                            consideration that I have deemed it impossible to avoid the formulation
                            of the reservations contained in my note above mentioned, in regard to
                            the violation, by certain provisions of the dahir, of a basic principle
                            of the Act of Algeciras, namely, “economic liberty without any
                            inequality.” In these conditions, I anticipate that the Department may
                            desire to instruct me to confirm, on its behalf, the reservations which
                            I have made.</p>
                        <p>My colleagues of Holland and of Belgium inform me that their governments
                            have filed, with the Protectorate Government, protests on similar
                            grounds, against the dahir.</p>
                        <p>The American Consul at Casablanca reports that his British colleague has
                            forwarded to his Government, with his endorsement, the objections of the
                            British Chamber of Commerce at Casablanca. Aside from the treaty
                            violations above referred to, these objections point out that the
                            definition of the prohibited articles is so vague as to leave ample
                            scope for arbitrary interpretation and action by the Protectorate
                            authorities. It is also suggested that Moroccan carpet makers, by
                            imitating, themselves, the designs of imported machine-made carpets,
                            which have long been popular among the well-to-do natives of Morocco,
                            would be able to bring under the ban of the dahir an imported carpet
                            trade of both normal character and long standing.</p>

                            No. 2038 [<hi rend="italic">1138</hi>] of March 6, 1936, with respect to
                            the Dahir dated January 2, 1936, for the regulation of the importation
                            of, and trade in, carpets and rugs in the French Zone of Morocco. The
                            Department notes that you have addressed a communication to the Resident
                            General pointing out that the Dahir in question is contrary to existing
                            treaty provisions, and it approves your action.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires that you should address a second note to the
                            Resident General, referring to your note of March 3, 1936, and stating
                            that the Department of State has instructed you to express its surprise
                            at the action of the Protectorate authorities in promulgating a decree
                            so contrary to the spirit and letter of the existing treaties. You
                            should add that the Department cannot recognize the validity of this
                            Dahir since it clearly violates the principle of “economic liberty
                            without any inequality” established by the Act of Algeciras by (1)
                            prohibiting the importation of products legitimately entitled to entry
                            into Morocco, and (2) imposing a discriminatory tax on the importation
                            of certain other products into Morocco.</p>

                            Embassy requested the views of the Government of the United States with
                            respect to proposed changes in the commercial régime now in operation in
                            the French Zone of Morocco. These changes would involve the imposition
                            of quantitative restrictions on the importation into Morocco of certain
                            commodities and the increase of certain customs rates.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States has been steadfast in its position
                            that the doors of Morocco should be kept open on a basis of commercial
                            equality for all nations, including France, the Protectorate Power. The
                            proposal to institute a system of quotas runs counter not only to that
                            position, but also to the trade program in which the <pb n="418"
                                xml:id="pg_418" facs="0483"/>United States is actively engaged. As
                            His Majesty’s Government is aware, this program is designed to restore
                            international trade by a lowering of the barriers that hamper its
                            natural flow and by its liberation, insofar as possible, from the many
                            extraordinary restrictions and handicaps which have been placed upon it
                            in recent years.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States holds steadfastly, in the development
                            of its commercial policy, to the rule of equality of treatment. It
                            believes that this rule, by enabling the international exchange of goods
                            to follow lines of economic benefit and by avoiding the many retaliatory
                            acts to which discrimination gives rise, is essential for the rebuilding
                            of international trade. Its judgment in this matter has been supported
                            by much disinterested opinion in which the authoritative expression is
                            to be found in a report of the League of Nations inquiry into clearing
                                agreements.<note n="14" xml:id="d506fn14">League of Nations,
                                Economic and Financial Committees, Joint Committee for the Study of

                                C.153.M.83.1935.II.B.).</note> The pursuit of this rule requires
                            that nations give equal opportunity in their markets to all countries
                            which follow the same policy, and accordingly refrain from creating
                            preferences. Furthermore, it is not susceptible of producing its full
                            benefit, in which the trade of all will share, unless countries are
                            willing to refrain from seeking a preferred position in the markets of
                            other countries; for discriminations thereby are inevitably created
                            which tend to produce retaliatory restrictions.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States has at all times in the exercise of
                            its treaty rights in Morocco endeavored to cooperate in every feasible
                            way in the commercial and economic development of Morocco. Therefore, if
                            Moorish economy now finds need for increased revenue from customs
                            sources, the Government of the United States is prepared, and has
                            previously so stated, to acquiesce in reasonable increases in existing
                            customs rates of duties on commodities imported into Morocco. It should
                            be understood, however, that the Government of the United States is not
                            unmindful of the fact that through the means afforded by Article 96 of
                            the Act of Algeciras the actual customs rates are frequently well in
                            excess of the 12½ percent ad valorem, by reason of an arbitrary fixation
                            of value of merchandise. On the other hand, the Government of the United
                            States is not convinced that the imposition of quantitative restrictions
                            upon the importation of certain items of merchandise into Morocco would
                            serve to increase the revenues of the Shereefian Government. Nor is it
                            clear that the proposed quota system would necessarily contribute to the
                            best economic interests of the Moroccan people.</p>
                        <p>From the foregoing, His Britannic Majesty’s Government will appreciate
                            the manifest difficulties, apparently insuperable, which prevent <pb
                                n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0484"/>the Government of the United
                            States from acquiescing in the proposed establishment of a quota system
                            in Morocco. As is shown, however, by its disposition towards a possible
                            modification of the Moroccan tariff rates, the Government of the United
                            States is by no means uncompromisingly opposed to any change, nor does
                            it wish to assume a legalistic attitude towards the Moroccan problem.
                            Nevertheless, the present régime in Morocco is squarely based upon legal
                            provisions incorporated in international agreements, and the United
                            States believes that these provisions of law ought not to be changed
                            except by due process of law. Therefore, and as evidence of its sincere
                            desire to cooperate with His Britannic Majesty’s Government and with the
                            Protectorate Government of Morocco, the Government of the United States
                            is prepared to agree to participate in a frank discussion, between
                            representatives of all the interested powers, of the various problems
                            involved.</p>

                                Morocco and other countries which would justify the necessity of
                                obtaining for the Spanish Zone a liberty of initiative imposed by
                                circumstances of fact and policies of a very different nature from
                                those <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0486"/>that governed the
                                situation during the past century, it is well to point out that the
                                most-favored-nation clause includes the right to invoke from other
                                countries an absolute reciprocity as to the concessions which are
                                made. If any other interpretation were given to the
                                most-favored-nation clause the result would be inequitable and the
                                Spanish Zone of Morocco would have to remain in a situation of frank
                                inferiority with respect to other countries.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, in the judgment of the High Commission there cannot be
                                deducted either from the letter or the spirit of the Convention of
                                1880 the interpretation which the Department of State in Washington
                                gives to Article 17 of the Madrid Convention of 1880 which confirms
                                previous agreements in those which establish with various countries
                                the most-favored-nation clause on the basis of reciprocity. Morocco
                                has not at any time renounced so equitable a principle and in proof
                                of this there can be cited among other documents the King’s
                                Regulation of 1935 giving to automobiles registered in the Spanish
                                Zone equal privileges to those obtained in the Zone by automobiles
                                of British registration.</p>
                            <p>There does not exist on the part of the Spanish Government the least
                                intention of making any difficulty for American citizens in the Zone
                                of the Protectorate, although it is not possible to agree to the
                                thesis that Morocco has lost the right to invoke reciprocity in her
                                relations with other countries, nor is it possible to give to the
                                United States a concession which supposes a more favorable
                                situation. Moreover, it is impossible to establish the precedent of
                                giving advantages without an equivalent counterpart.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I must invite the attention of Your Excellency to the
                                fact that the Netherlands and Switzerland obtained the advantage
                                which the United States desires in exchange for the giving in just
                                reciprocity to the natives of the Zone the same right in their
                                respective territories with the exception of the Dutch colonies
                                (dahirs of June 20, 1929 for Switzerland and August 1, 1930 for the
                                Netherlands). Moreover, in view of the fact that the Washington
                                Government has not given official recognition to the Spanish
                                Protectorate in Morocco,<note n="21" xml:id="d507fn21">See <ref

                                the receipt of Your Excellency’s Note No. 57 of April 3rd with
                                reference to the requirement that a citizen of the United States
                                traveling through or resorting to the Spanish Zone of influence in
                                Morocco obtain a visa and pay a fee therefor. The above mentioned
                                Note refers to my Note No. 346 of December 17, 1934 and states in
                                part that in the judgment of the High Commission there cannot be
                                deduced either from the letter or the spirit of the Convention of
                                1880 the interpretation which the Department of State gives to
                                Article 17 of the Madrid Convention of 1880. Your Excellency’s Note,
                                however, does not refer to my Note No. 535 of September 10,

                                September 10th Note, to the end that American citizens resorting to
                                or traveling through the Spanish Zone of influence in Morocco should
                                not be subject to the requirement that they obtain visas for

                            translation of a memorandum from the Foreign Office, dated December 30
                            last, regarding the payment of certain American claims in the Spanish
                            Zone of Morocco, and the recognition of that Zone by the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0488"/>
                        <p>I regret to say that in this memorandum the Spanish Government makes it
                            evident that the opinions expressed in the last paragraph of a note from
                            the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to this Embassy of January 22, 1930—a
                            translation of which was enclosed in despatch No. 49 of February 27,
                                1930<note n="27" xml:id="d508fn27"><ref target="frus1930v03#pg_607"

                            good. In other words, the Spanish Government makes the payment of the
                            claims contingent upon not only recognition of the Spanish Zone but upon
                            an agreement to abolish our capitulatory rights in the Zone.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish point of view was pointed out in my despatch No. 638 of
                            January 10, 1935,<note n="28" xml:id="d508fn28"><ref

                                    vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 999</ref>.</note> but since
                            that time the Embassy has made a vigorous and sustained effort to secure
                            the payment of our claims in return for recognition of the Zone alone.
                            The matter has been discussed at the Foreign Office many times and the
                            Embassy has been led to believe that the Foreign Office favored a
                            settlement and would do all that it could to forward it. I am inclined
                            now to believe, however, that there is a difference of opinion in the
                            Foreign Office itself and that the Moroccan Bureau and officials of the
                            High Commission in Morocco remain intransigent.</p>
                        <p>Upon the receipt of the memorandum I pointed out orally at the Foreign
                            Office that the injection of the question of the capitulations into the
                            present discussions was more likely to retard than advance the Spanish
                            desire for the abolition of capitulatory rights. I said that the payment
                            for the claims in question had been agreed upon, if only informally, by
                            Spanish and American representatives, and that there was no fairness or
                            logic in making their payment contingent upon the settlement of a
                            totally different question.</p>
                        <p>I am inclined to believe that further negotiation at the present time for
                            the payment of our claims would be useless, but in the event that the
                            Department desires a reply to the memorandum to be made I request
                            instructions as to what should be said.</p>
                        <p>It is now obvious that the withholding of recognition of the Spanish Zone
                            is a useless weapon to bring about payment of our claims. I believe,
                            therefore, that the Department should consider, from a purely selfish
                            point of view, whether recognition of the Zone should not be accorded
                            some time in the near future. Such recognition would enable our
                            Diplomatic Agent at Tangier to deal directly with the Spanish High
                            Commissioner to the Zone regarding the many questions there at issue, a
                            thing which he is now unable to do. At present Mr. Blake is sometimes
                            obliged to request the Department to instruct this Embassy to take up
                            some matter with the Spanish Foreign Office. The Foreign Office then
                            takes it up with the Moroccan Bureau, the Bureau with the High
                            Commissioner, and much time has elapsed <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424"
                                facs="0489"/>before Tangier receives any answer, which is returned
                            by the same tortuous route. It therefore seems obvious that efficient
                            prompt handling of Moroccan questions would be forwarded by recognition
                            which would permit our Diplomatic Agent to go directly to the High
                            Commissioner. Mr. Blake’s opinion should obviously be obtained on this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>Some time in the future the Department may also wish to consider the
                            question of the abolition of our capitulatory rights in Morocco. Mr.
                                Culbertson,<note n="29" xml:id="d508fn29">Paul Trauger Culbertson,
                                Assistant Chief, Division of Western European Affairs.</note> during
                            his recent visit to Madrid, was informed of the Embassy’s point of view
                            in this regard. There is some justice in the observations made in the
                            enclosed memorandum regarding the changed conditions in Morocco and the
                            consequent lack of reason to maintain capitulatory rights. On the other
                            hand, Mr. Blake has advanced various reasons for the maintenance of such
                            rights and possibly to these may be added the present intransigence of
                            the Spanish Government in settlement of our claims. Nevertheless, it may
                            be possible at some future time to negotiate an agreement which may
                            adequately protect our commercial position in Morocco and secure the
                            payment of our claims through the surrender of the capitulations. Such
                            rights have been surrendered by all countries with the exception of
                            England and the United States, and while there are many Englishmen doing
                            business in Morocco, I understand from Mr. Blake there are but two or
                            three Americans there. Since our commercial position in the Zone depends
                            rather on the Act of Algeciras<note n="30" xml:id="d508fn30">General Act
                                of the International Conference of Algeciras, signed April 7, 1906,

                            Moroccan treaties than on the capitulations, and as the principal effect
                            of the latter is the giving of a special position to a few American
                            protégés, it would seem that if and when our interests are protected by
                            an agreement, which perhaps could be easily negotiated, we might well
                            surrender our capitulatory rights. This is obviously a question,
                            however, upon which a better opinion can be given by our Diplomatic
                            Agency in Tangier than by this Embassy.</p>

                                the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the American Embassy in Madrid
                                on January 22, 1930.<note n="31" xml:id="d508fn31"><ref

                            <p>In accordance with this note the Spanish Government accepted a,
                                certain number of claims, not because the Spanish authorities
                                considered them as indisputable but inspired by friendly and cordial
                                spirit toward the Washington Government and in the belief that this
                                settlement would have influence to the end that the United States in
                                a just interchange should not only officially recognize the Spanish
                                protectorate over the Zone, but should proceed also to the
                                renunciation of the regime of capitulations. As a consequence of
                                this criterion in the last paragraph of the note referred to above
                                the Spanish Government desires to know the date on which the
                                agreement for renunciation of capitulations may be signed in order
                                to remit in Tangier or in Washington, at the choice of the
                                Government of the United States, the amount of the agreed upon
                                claims.</p>
                            <p>The Spanish authorities of the Moroccan Zone believe that in
                                recognizing the above mentioned American claims they have acted with
                                an ample criterion of benevolence, since if these claims had been
                                examined from the standpoint of strict justice some of them would
                                still be found to be debatable. Not to insist more regarding the
                                greater or less foundation of these claims, either with respect to
                                their value or as to the sums asked for is a proof of benevolence
                                and a further reason that their payment should be simultaneous with
                                the recognition on the part of the American Government of the
                                Spanish protectorate and with the renunciation of the regime of
                                capitulations.</p>
                            <p>It does not appear necessary to give extensive reasons as to the
                                justice of this desire of the Spanish Government, not only because
                                every regime of capitulations implies a lack of confidence regarding
                                the judicial and administrative authorities of the country which
                                submits to them, but because it is logical that if the United States
                                recognizes officially the Spanish Protectorate it should accept
                                simultaneously the jurisdiction of the Spanish authorities, that is
                                to say of the same authorities which are accepted by all of the
                                American residents in Spain. To accept the jurisdiction of Spanish
                                tribunals and authorities in National Spanish territory and on the
                                contrary not to accept it in the Moroccan Zone would constitute a
                                contradiction or incongruity very difficult to justify. Spain, which
                                has made in the Moroccan Zone innumerable sacrifices of every kind,
                                hopes from the excellent friendship and most cordial relations which
                                unite it with the United States that the Washington Government will
                                not <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0491"/>maintain in the future
                                any difficulty for the normal functioning of the judicial and
                                administrative authorities of the Spanish Zone, which would happen
                                if the regime of capitulations, the cause of very many
                                inconveniences, should be maintained with reference to American
                                citizens.</p>
                            <p>The payment of indemnities to other countries, such as Holland, took
                                place at the moment when they proceeded to the renunciation of
                                capitulations, that is to say both questions were settled at the
                                same time. In these circumstances it would be difficult to concede
                                to the United States a treatment more favorable in this regard than
                                was conceded to other nations.</p>
                            <p>The renunciation of capitulatory rights in our Protectorate should
                                not be subordinated to the settlement of pending claims in the
                                French Zone nor should further delay be justified by the argument
                                that such a renunciation should take place simultaneously in the two
                                Moroccan Zones. Holland renounced capitulations in the French
                                Protectorate in 1916 and did so later in the Spanish Zone.
                                Switzerland and other countries also renounced the privileges
                                derived from the regime of capitulations in one Zone before doing so
                                in the other.</p>
                            <p>The preceding considerations, so well expressed in a summarized form,
                                fully justify the aspiration of the Spanish Government to arrive in
                                the shortest possible time at a satisfactory agreement by virtue of
                                which the American claims may be definitely liquidated at the same
                                time that recognition of the Protectorate should take place and
                                renunciation be made on the part of the United States Government of
                                a regime which years ago may have been justified in Morocco but
                                which today has no reason whatever in favor of its maintenance. The
                                Spanish Government trusts that in a new consideration and study of
                                this matter on the part of the Washington Government the latter may
                                be inclined to share the point of view which has been expressed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor, in response to the
                            Department’s cable Instruction No. 1 of January 30, 1936, 5 p.m.,
                            respectfully to submit my observations upon the Spanish Memorandum
                            enclosed in Ambassador Bowers’ despatch No. 1012 of January 13, 1936,
                            and upon the action suggested in that despatch.</p>
                        <p>The various points of the Spanish Memorandum are hereunder serially
                            summarized and followed by their relative rejoinders: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>1. That the settlement of the American claims must be conditioned
                                    not only by recognition of the Spanish Zone, but by abrogation
                                    of American capitulatory rights in that Zone.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This is a departure from the agreed basis of the negotiations, and is
                            aptly characterized in the fourth paragraph of the Ambassador’s
                            despatch. The question of the capitulations, it will be recalled, was
                            clearly excluded, in the initial exchange of Notes between the
                            Department and the Spanish Ambassador in Washington, from the
                            discussions relative to the settlement of claims and the recognition of
                            the Spanish Zone. (See Note of July 26, 1927, from Spanish Ambassador in

                                merely upon the benevolence of the Spanish Foreign Office.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>These claims have all arisen from violation of elementary principles of
                            justice, or from violation of American treaty rights. In their
                            settlement, it is not benevolent treatment, but some approach to
                            justice, which is claimed. The conciliatory concessions made in regard
                            to them, by the American negotiator, rather weighs the balance of
                            benevolence on the American side.</p>
                        <p>If any such assumption as this is to prevail, it might be appropriately
                            suggested to the Spanish Government that the Department would be quite
                            agreeable to have the matter of the claims submitted to arbitration, as
                            was done in the case of British claims; the Department cannot but reject
                            the imputation that it is pressing for the settlement of unjustified
                            claims, and further it has no intention of appealing to any charitable
                            considerations in the matter.</p>

                                accept it in the Spanish Zone of Morocco, is an unjustifiable

                        <p>The charge is absolutely irrelevant, since the political conditions in
                            the territories referred to are fundamentally different. In Spain, the
                            judicial and administrative authorities are those of a sovereign
                            state.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish intervention in Morocco is of the nature of an administrative
                            trust; it does not give Spain sovereign rights in that country. The
                            authority of the Spanish Protectorate Government there, is governed
                            vis-à-vis the treaty powers by the same limitations as those which are
                            imposed upon the Shereefian Government by the Morocco treaties. The
                            removal of any such limitations can obviously be effected only with the
                            consent of the treaty power concerned, and there is nothing incongruous
                            in the maintenance by such power of any particular existing treaty right
                            (e. g., extraterritorial jurisdiction) until it deems conditions to be
                            satisfactory for the respect and continued safeguard of its remaining
                            treaty rights (economic, commercial and civil), under the modified
                            administrative regime (Spanish Protectorate) which it is expected to
                            recognize.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that no negotiations could properly be entered into with
                            Spain, for the surrender of any American rights under the Moroccan
                            treaties, until her position, as a Protectorate power in Morocco, had
                            first received the formal recognition of the American Government.</p>

                        <p>So far as we are concerned, such lack of confidence is amply justified,
                            but that consideration is beside the point. The reply to the Spanish
                            Government is that without questioning the guarantees of justice which
                            may be afforded by the judicial organization of the Spanish Zone, the
                            relinquishment of the capitulations raises a question of the
                            modification of our treaties in Morocco, and involves a restatement, in
                            substitute treaties, of our now existing treaty rights in that
                            country—substitute treaties which would require the approval of the
                            Senate. It might appropriately be added that it would be difficult to
                            present a proposition to that body, for an abrogation of the clauses of
                            the Moroccan treaties relative to our extraterritorial rights in the
                            Spanish Zone, in the face of evidence of such serious violations by the
                            Spanish authorities there of other provisions of the same treaties,
                            which define our economic and commercial rights in the Shereefian

                                abandoned the capitulations, it would be difficult for the Spanish
                                Government “to concede to the United States a treatment more

                            made only to illustrate the procedure followed between the French and
                            American Governments, namely, that a settlement of outstanding American
                            claims in the French Zone had preceded American recognition of the
                            French Protectorate, without renunciation of American capitulations in
                            that Zone of Morocco. No reference has ever been made, in these
                            conversations, to claims actually pending in the French Zone. This
                            allusion of the Spanish Foreign Office to pending claims in the French
                            Zone, is again entirely irrelevant to the issue between the American and
                            Spanish Governments, and results from a confused knowledge of our

                        <p>Since the Moroccan treaties to which the United States is a party apply
                            to Morocco as a political and economic unit, the Department has hitherto
                            held that it would become practical to consider the abrogation of the
                            capitulations only when conditions in Morocco as a whole made it
                            possible to proceed with a submission, for the approval of the Senate,
                            of substitute treaties with Morocco, relative to the entire territory of
                            the Empire (French, Spanish and Tangier Zones). To say the least there
                            is involved a matter of convenience to the American Government, such as
                            is deserving of consideration on the part of the soliciting Governments.

                        <p>The foregoing analysis of the contents of the Spanish Note, it is hoped,
                            may be found to contain some suggestive indications, in the event that
                            the Department may desire to instruct the Embassy in Madrid to make a
                            reply to the Memorandum.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador’s despatch appears to suggest that, since our withholding
                            of recognition is proving a useless weapon to bring about the payment of
                            our claims, the Department should consider the feasibility of a
                            voluntary recognition of the Spanish Protectorate, on our part, and
                            reserve, for a later date, the relinquishment of our capitulatory
                            rights, as a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> for the eventual
                            settlement of American claims in the Spanish Zone.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador’s suggestion is made, perhaps, under the impression—or
                            with the hope—that American recognition of the Spanish Protectorate—by
                            permitting direct official contact between the Diplomatic Agent at
                            Tangier and the Spanish High Commissioner at Tetuan—would obviate the
                            present circuitous route via Washington and Madrid for representations
                            to the Spanish Government in respect of Moroccan questions, which, as a
                            consequence of recognition, could then be normally treated directly
                            between Tangier and Tetuan.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, I can but express my conviction that these happy results
                            cannot be anticipated.</p>
                        <p>A <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> between the American Legation at
                            Tangier and the authorities at Tetuan has been re-established, providing
                            informal contacts through the medium of the Spanish Consulate General at
                            Tangier, which mutually permit the adjustment of local complaints made
                            by either authority. In this way matters involving individual incidents
                            of minor importance are frequently settled. It is certain, however, from
                            my observation, and from the experience of my colleagues whose
                            governments have already recognized the Spanish Protectorate, that no
                            improvement in the adjustment of controversies, would follow American
                            recognition of the Spanish Zone, of greater moment that [<hi

                        <p>It is the experience of all my colleagues that any major individual
                            question, or any representations regarding legislative or administrative
                            measures taken by the Spanish Protectorate authorities, in violation of
                            the economic or commercial clauses of the Moroccan treaties, are given,
                            at best, but a perfunctory hearing at the High Commissariat at Tetuan,
                            and that on all questions of any importance, additional <pb n="431"
                                xml:id="pg_431" facs="0496"/>representations are made to the Spanish
                            Government in Madrid, by the Embassies or Legations concerned, often, it
                            is true, with equally negative results.</p>
                        <p>I do say, however, notwithstanding these circumstances, that direct
                            official contact between the American representative in Morocco and the
                            Spanish High Commissioner at Tetuan, if secured in proper conditions, is
                            desirable and might be advantageous, but the advantage would be so small
                            as to be unworthy of consideration, especially if obtained only at the
                            cost of a gratuitous concession on our part, and the sacrifice of a
                            strong, logical tactical position such as we now occupy.</p>
                        <p>I can therefore but suggest that the Department stand firmly by the
                            procedure, to which the Spanish Government appears to be explicitly
                            committed by the Spanish Ambassador’s Note to the Secretary of State, of
                            July 26, 1927, namely, a settlement of outstanding American claims in
                            the Spanish Zone, to precede formal recognition of the Spanish
                            Protectorate in Morocco by the American Government, and I venture to
                            indicate, hereunder, some considerations in support of this
                            recommendation:</p>
                        <p>1. The actual payment of American claims—however equitable and long
                            overdue—should not be viewed out of its proper perspective. Recognition
                            of the Spanish position in Morocco, on the part of the American
                            Government, must carry with it, on the part of the Spanish Government, a
                            recognition of American treaty rights in Morocco, in existence prior to
                            the intervention of Spain in the Shereefian Empire, and there must be a
                            formal undertaking by Spain, as a protectorate power in Morocco, to
                            respect the continued maintenance of these American treaty rights. It is
                            precisely because the claims are the result of violations of American
                            treaty rights, that their settlement, as a preliminary to recognition,
                            is of such vital importance to the principles at issue.</p>
                        <p>2. In the view of the Spaniards, a relinquishment of this condition on
                            our part might be construed as the successful result of their shifty
                            tactics, and I feel it would be unwise and undesirable, in any
                            circumstances, voluntarily to capitulate from sheer weariness under the
                            tortuous policy which has been pursued by the Spanish Government
                            throughout the negotiations. Such action could but render more difficult
                            ulterior negotiations, and make more remote our ultimate object, namely,
                            an agreement which will prove helpful to Spain in her administrative
                            mission, and also provide adequate safeguards for American rights and
                            interests in Morocco.</p>
                        <p>3. We could not with propriety deal with Spain in the matter of the
                            recognition of the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, on terms more
                            favorable than those which we adopted in regard to France, when
                            recognizing the French Protectorate.</p>
                        <p>The French agreed to settle all outstanding American claims in the French
                            Zone, as a preliminary to recognition, and there is no reason whatever
                            why this logical process should be departed from in the Spanish
                            case.</p>

                        <p>As an alternative compromise, it appears to me that it would be
                            impossible for us to go, with safety, any further than a reiteration of
                            the five-point formula suggested by me in my conferences with Ambassador
                            Bowers in Madrid, in January of last year, and fully explained in my

                            authority reserved to the Palestine Courts to intervene in Consular
                            Court cases. Accordingly the Department is of the opinion that American
                            consular officers in Palestine should refrain from exercising any of the

                        <p>To understand the atmosphere which prevailed in Palestine immediately
                            prior to April 17 when it appeared that a disturbance of the local peace
                            was imminent, the Consulate General believes it wise to refer to its
                            despatch No. 691 of November 25, 1935,<note n="4" xml:id="d512fn4">Not
                                printed.</note> which was submitted subsequent to the events which
                            succeeded the discovery of an important arms importation at the port of
                            Jaffa and which described a situation closely related to that existing
                            at the present moment. At that time, it will be remembered, tension was
                            high and the fear existed that an open break between Arabs and Jews
                            would occur at any time. The situation was further involved by the
                            activities of Sheikh Izz-Ed-Din Kassem who organized bands of political
                            highwaymen and, in effect, challenged the police to maintain security on
                            the roads of north Palestine. His actions were said to constitute his
                            contribution to the organized Arab protests that the local Government
                            was unable to discover the importers or even to put a stop to the
                            traffic in arms. Sheikh Izz-Ed-Din’s activities resulted in the <pb
                                n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0500"/>death of one British constable,
                            the wounding of another, and in the death of four members of his
                            organization (if such it may be called) and the capture of five others.
                            Political brigandage thereafter disappeared in Palestine until during
                            the week of April 5, when it reappeared and helped to precipitate the
                            present disorders.</p>
                        <p>It will likewise be remembered that the tension which existed during
                            October and November was dissipated only after the High
                                Commissioner<note n="5" xml:id="d512fn5">Lt. Gen. Sir Arthur
                                Wauchope.</note> advanced his proposals for a Legislative Council.
                            These proposals successfully broke down the united front which had been
                            established by the five Arab parties in circumstances which they
                            described as a “national emergency”, by causing a renaissance of the
                            political and personal jealousies which had hitherto characterized Arab
                            politics in Palestine. As negotiations between the Arab leaders on the
                            one hand, and between the leaders and the personnel of their respective
                            parties on the other, continued, the breaking down of the united front
                            became more apparent and all thought of united Arab action in regard to
                            the Legislative Council was abandoned. Whether or not present events
                            will restore the united front still remains to be seen, for the struggle
                            between Husseini<note n="6" xml:id="d512fn6">Jamal Efendi al-Husseini,

                            severe at the present moment than ever before.</p>
                        <p>The Jewish attitude on the other hand became more unified. Organized
                            opposition to the Legislative Council was crystallized not only in
                            Palestine but throughout the world and particularly in Great Britain,
                            where continual and urgent representations against the Council were
                            carried on. An important by-product of the solidarity which the Jews
                            exhibited, which was first mentioned in the Consulate General’s despatch
                            No. 691, became more and more noticeable during the period between
                            November and April: an attitude which began as one of smugness and
                            cocksureness and which gradually evolved, as mentioned in the Consulate
                            General’s despatch of April 18,<note n="8" xml:id="d512fn8">Not found in
                                Department files.</note> into one of open derogation of the local
                            authorities and even of the High Commissioner. Several noteworthy
                            incidents illustrating the new attitude occurred during that time:
                            Jewish individuals, apparently spontaneously and not in accordance with
                            any preconceived plan or design, began indulging in acts of an anti-Arab
                            nature which, although of no particular importance in themselves, were
                            significant when taken together. Stones were thrown at passing Arabs,
                            shop windows were broken, tills robbed and finally, early in March on
                            the occasion <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0501"/>of the opening of
                            the Dizengoff Museum in Tel Aviv, a large crowd of Jews openly hissed
                            the High Commissioner when he arrived at the building in which the
                            museum is housed. Never before had such an occurrence taken place.
                            During the same time, also, the feeling was prevalent that relations
                            between the High Commissioner and Jewish leaders were becoming strained
                            because of his ardent desire to establish a legislative council, and the
                            equally ardent desire on the part of the Jews to prevent its
                            institution. The Jewish attitude thus became definitely
                            anti-Mandatory.</p>
                        <p>The above background will perhaps make more understandable the series of
                            events which occurred during the middle of this month. As reported by
                            telegram on April 18, the first factor contributing to the occurrence of
                            the disturbances was the recrudescence of political highway robbery by
                            bands of Arabs. Although Sheikh Izz-ed-Din had been captured and
                            executed by the police, his spirit was reinvoked to inspire the Arabs to
                            begin again their annoying practices on the highways. There was,
                            however, a difference in the <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> of
                            these bands as compared with those which operated under Sheikh
                            Izz-ed-Din. The latter worked merely to annoy the Government, whereas
                            the former operate on what can only be described as anti-Jewish lines.
                            On one occasion busses were stopped on the Tulkarm-Nablus Road and all
                            the passengers were forced to alight. The only three Jews in the busses
                            were then segregated from their fellow passengers and placed in the cab
                            of a truck at the head of the stopped column of cars. The door of the
                            cab was closed and the Jews were fired upon at point-blank range. Of the
                            three, one was killed outright, one died later of wounds, and the third
                            was severely wounded. This incident was followed the next night by a
                            revenge killing of two Arabs by Jews in a small hut on the Petah
                            Tikva–Ranaana Road. It is reported by the police in this respect that at
                            10 p.m. on April 16 a car stopped before the hut and one of its
                            occupants knocked on the door. In response to the knock the door was
                            opened and two persons believed by the police to be Jews entered and,
                            finding two Arabs within, shot them both dead on sight. One was shot six
                            times with a Browning automatic and the other five with a Parabellum.
                            The car with its occupants then disappeared.</p>
                        <p>When these facts became known the following morning tension between Arabs
                            and Jews reached a crucial point. The situation was rendered acute later
                            in the morning when the Jew who had been murdered by the “terrorists”
                            two days before was buried as a martyr in the cemetery on the outskirts
                            of Tel Aviv. The cortege following the body worked itself into a frenzy
                            of righteous indignation and became disorderly. The efforts of the
                            Jewish police of Tel Aviv to restore order and control the course of the
                            procession were unavailing. <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0502"/>A
                            clash ensued and the Jewish police were routed. Reserves of British
                            police were immediately called and likewise were attacked. By this time
                            the excitement had spread to the occupants of nearby houses who joined
                            the fray by throwing flower pots, cement building blocks and even iron
                            bedsteads upon the heads of the police below. At one moment it seemed as
                            though the British police would likewise be routed and troops were
                            ordered to stand by from the encampment at Sarafand. Fortunately,
                            however, order was at length restored, but not until after the police
                            had been forced to fire into the crowd and many casualties had occurred
                            both among the police and the rioters. The authorities were particularly
                            apprehensive during the course of these disturbances because at Ramleh,
                            no more than ten miles away, crowds of excited Arabs were celebrating
                            the local feast of Nebi Saleh, and had word of the riots in Tel Aviv
                            reached them a most serious situation would almost certainly have
                            developed.</p>
                        <p>The following day, Saturday, passed without incident, but in an
                            atmosphere of extreme tension. The police and the military authorities
                            prepared for serious trouble.</p>
                        <p>On Sunday their fears were justified. A large crowd of Arabs gathered in
                            the morning before the offices of the District Commissioner in Jaffa to
                            protest against the murder of the two Arabs killed on the 16th, and as
                            they were milling about in the square and working themselves into a
                            condition of frenzy two Jews appeared and were immediately set upon. The
                            crowd of Arabs then went berserk and pursued every Jew they saw.
                            Fortunately, not many were at hand. The crowd then turned its attention
                            to the main Jaffa–Jerusalem highway, stopping all cars and inspecting
                            them for Jewish passengers. Many cars were wrecked and many casualties
                            took place, among them an official of the Public Works Department, the
                            son of the honorary Swedish Consul, the son of a well-known British
                            contractor and a member of the Royal Air Force. When order was finally
                            restored at 3:30 in the afternoon total casualties amounted to <table

                        <p>Monday morning dawned on a Palestine prepared for disturbances of the
                            most serious sort. All shops were closed and traffic was at a minimum on
                            the roads. At about 9 a.m. the police received word of fresh outbreaks
                            in Jaffa and, as a result traffic ceased on the Jerusalem–Jaffa road and
                            was convoyed on the Jerusalem–Nazareth road. The disturbances remained
                            localized in the no-man’s-land between Jaffa and Tel Aviv, where a
                            platoon of the Cameron Highlanders had been stationed the day before,
                            but a few minor incidents of stoning automobiles occurred in the
                            Northern District near Jenin. To combat <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438"
                                facs="0503"/>this development the Air Officer Commanding despatched
                            detachments of armored cars to Nablus, Tulkarm and Jenin and likewise
                            ordered detachments of troops to support the police at Tulkarm in case
                            of a clash between the Arabs of that district and the Jews of the
                            neighboring colonies. Casualties in Jaffa on April 20 were as follows: 5
                            Jews killed and 26 wounded; 2 Arabs killed and 32 wounded; on that day
                            also 2 Jews died of injuries received on the previous day.</p>
                        <p>Outside of the fracas in Jaffa the only important items to note on April
                            20 are two incidents which occurred on the Jerusalem-Nazareth road: a
                            convoy of cars carrying visiting French officers back to Syria was
                            stoned near Jenin and windshields and windows were broken; the French
                            Consul General abandoned his car near Nablus because of a demonstration
                            then in progress and returned to Jerusalem by train. Also on that day
                            Consuls Lynch and Scott journeyed to Tel Aviv and back to Jerusalem
                            after learning that no American individuals or property had been
                            involved in the disturbances, and Consul Brent returned from Haifa—all
                            without incident.</p>
                        <p>On April 21 the situation was reported as being “easier”. Nineteen
                            persons were wounded, 14 Arabs and 5 Jews, in “isolated assaults”; a
                            Jewish lumber yard and other buildings were fired in Jaffa; traffic was
                            resumed under convoy on the Jerusalem–Jaffa road; a crowd of Arabs bent
                            on invading an outlying quarter of Tel Aviv were repulsed by the police;
                            a general strike, which in effect has been only partial, was begun by
                            Arab shopkeepers and still continues on April 25. This strike, which is
                            supposed to have been inspired by that of the Damascene merchants some
                            weeks ago and which is scheduled to last “until Arab demands are met”,
                            is a most half-hearted affair unsupported by the Nashashibi element. (As
                            far as can be determined the Arab “demands” are the traditional ones:
                            cessation of Jewish immigration and termination of land sales to
                            Jews.)</p>
                        <p>The most significant events of April 21 were the orations delivered by
                            the Messrs. Rokach and Dizengoff, Vice-Mayor and Mayor of Tel Aviv
                            respectively, before a crowd estimated at 10,000 persons who had
                            gathered when Tel Aviv buried its dead of the day before. In the course
                            of his oration Mr. Rokach said: “These victims have not shed their blood
                            for nothing. This incident will open the eyes of the Jews to the
                            necessity of joining together with renewed energy and strength …”<note

                                despatch.</note> Mr. Dizengoff’s remarks were perhaps more pointed:
                            “Some have fallen and the living must take their places … Many before
                            you have made the same sacrifice. All of us are ready to make it … You
                            have fallen not as wrongdoers but as a <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439"

                            to secure enough power to keep at bay the danger which pursues us

                            … No savage force, no murders, no attacks will move us from our position

                        <p>April 22 and 23 passed under circumstances officially described as “quiet
                            but tense”. No incident of importance occurred. A few burnings were
                            reported, traffic moved under convoy and rumors were rife. It is hard to
                            describe the variety, extent and seriousness of these rumors. They
                            included everything: Arabs were attacking Jewish colonies, serious riots
                            had occurred in Hebron, the Jewish village of Talpioth had been
                            destroyed by the Arabs of Bethlehem, Haifa was a bloody battlefield, the
                            Mufti had been arrested and deported, troops had arrived from Egypt. All
                            of these tales were eventually, and with maddening loss of time, proved
                            false.</p>
                        <p>Two events which occurred during these two days are, however, worthy of
                            mention. Both are important when considering the altered Jewish
                            attitude. During the night of April 22 a police patrol was fired upon by
                            Jews in the Tel Aviv district; the police returned the fire and a Jew
                            was wounded. This fact was first circulated as rumor but was later
                            confirmed and embodied in an official communiqué to which the Jewish
                            Agency took formal exception on the ground that the report was unfounded
                            and the Government was therefore culpable of disseminating untruths
                            calculated to redound to the discredit of the Jews.</p>
                        <p>The second event occurred on April 23. It was a speech made by Dr.
                            Weizmann when opening the World Congress of Jewish Physicians, at Tel
                            Aviv. The essence of Dr. Weizmann’s remarks is contained in the
                            following words: “This Congress is a symbol of our answer to the attacks
                            of the last few days … On one side the forces of destruction, the forces
                            of the desert have arisen, and on the other stand firm the forces of
                            civilization—but we will not be stopped.” These words are worth
                            considering. They contain Weizmann’s opinion of the Arabs and his
                            challenge to the Mandatory; both apparently honestly expressed.</p>
                        <p>April 24 was awaited with more apprehension than any preceding day. As
                            there had been three days of relative calm and as it was also Friday,
                            the Moslem day of rest and, from sunset, also the Jewish Sabbath, it was
                            presumed that if anything was to happen it would happen on that day, and
                            probably in Jerusalem where are situated the Dome of the Rock and the
                            Wailing Wall. But nothing happened. <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440"
                                facs="0505"/>The day finally dragged tensely to a close, but with
                            the immediate outlook unchanged. Several theories are advanced to
                            explain the absence of disturbances on April 24. The most likely in the
                            Consulate General’s view is that the Arab leaders had never been behind
                            the Jaffa outbreaks, which were participated in principally by
                            irresponsible Haurani workers<note n="9" xml:id="d512fn9">A poor type of
                                labor employed in the ports for handling of cargo ashore.</note> in
                            the port, and had not been more than half-hearted in their advocation of
                            the general strike. Nashashibi, in fact, had urged on several occasions
                            and particularly on April 23 that the leaders make a statement
                            disavowing the present unrest, that they call off the strike and depart
                            for London where they have been invited to express their views on the
                            Legislative Council. Whether or not this advice will prevail will not be
                            known until too late for inclusion in this despatch, as the meeting of
                            leaders to determine present Arab policy is now in session and will not
                            have ended before the mail closes. But it is believed that the fellaheen
                            and townsmen, although perhaps in the mood for demonstrations on April
                            24, were not sufficiently affected by recent events to brave of their
                            own accord the rifles and batons of the military and the police who were
                            in riot mood.</p>
                        <p>In brief summary: the disturbances appear to have been begun by Jews
                            entering a square in Jaffa which was packed by irresponsible Arabs
                            gathered to demand the punishment of the alleged Jews who had murdered
                            two Arabs two days previously; the district of unrest was localized in
                            Jaffa–Tel Aviv for two days, when it spread without serious effect to
                            the Arab nationalist centers in the north; the lukewarm attitude of the
                            Arab leaders in general and of Nashashibi in particular appears to have
                            prevented the spread of the disturbances and to have maintained quiet in
                            Jerusalem (for riots would probably have occurred regardless of the
                            careful preparations and presence in large numbers of both the police
                            and the military had incitement been sufficient); the Arabs may use the
                            present situation as a fulcrum for their demands (as was done with
                            success in Egypt and Syria); and, finally, the situation has adduced
                            considerable evidence to demonstrate that a significant alteration of
                            attitude has occurred among the Jews, both individuals and officials—an
                            attitude which implies the pushing ahead of Zionist designs in the face
                            of all resistance, whether offered by Arab or Mandatory. In this respect
                            the most significant fact, and one that has thus far not been mentioned
                            in this despatch, is that the Jewish defense organization Haganah, once
                            guarded in the utmost secrecy, is now openly boasted of as a sort of
                            Zionist army, trained, disciplined and armed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Consulate
                            General’s despatch No. 62 of April 25, 1936, concerning the present
                            disturbances, and to supplement that despatch with the following
                            comments on the situation as it has developed from April 25 until the
                            present date.</p>
                        <p>When despatch No. 62 was submitted the situation was briefly as follows:
                            the Arabs were conducting a general strike which did not have the
                            whole-hearted support of all the Arab leaders, the internal situation of
                            the country, although relatively quiet, was rendered tense by isolated
                            instances of arson, stabbing, sniping at night, minor disturbances in
                            most of the towns and cities containing an appreciable Arab population,
                            and by such forms of agricultural sabotage as the burning of crops, the
                            despoliation of groves and the uprooting of trees. The Arab leaders had
                            not then decided exactly what their policy would be. The Jewish attitude
                            was one of watchful waiting.</p>
                        <p>With the exception of the policy of the Arab leaders the situation has
                            undergone no notable change since April 25. The description contained in
                            the above paragraph applies perfectly well to the present situation,
                            although it must be recognized that the most trifling of incidents,
                            whether accidental or of design, could precipitate disorders of a most
                            serious nature. Such disorders would almost certainly involve a spirited
                            armed defense by the Jews, if they considered themselves attacked, and
                            would consequently be considerably more grave than any that have yet
                            occurred in Palestine. The possibility of such Jewish action is not
                            discounted by the authorities, who state that if the Haganah becomes
                            active it will be “considered as an organization of rebels and treated
                            as such”.</p>
                        <p>It will be remembered that on April 25 the Arab leaders held a meeting to
                            determine their line of policy. As far as can be learned the meeting was
                            of a stormy nature and no agreement was reached until late in the
                            afternoon. Nashashibi urged that the strike be abandoned and that the
                            delegation proceed to London. The Mufti argued for a continuance of the
                            strike and a unanimous Arab attitude. At length Nashashibi saw that he
                            was outnumbered and consented, for the sake of solidarity, to lend his
                            support to the strike. This he did wholeheartedly. His newspaper, <hi
                                rend="italic">Falastin</hi>, carried editorials supporting the Arab
                            program and urging that every shop owner and chauffeur join the strike
                            which, from that moment, became general and worthy of serious
                            consideration.</p>

                        <p>The internal situation is becoming more acute daily. Recent developments
                            include repeated efforts to sever telegraph and telephone
                            communications, an attack by armed Arabs on a convoy near Haifa and most
                            significant an attack by Arabs on a detachment of Cameron Highlanders
                            during which one of the latter was wounded when the Arabs were being

                            protection for them. He emphasizes that the local authorities have given

                            participate in the intensive campaign now being carried on against

                            situation has been definitely easier for the past week. The strike has

                            offices are still closed. It is possible the turning point is
                            approaching unless Arabs should be seriously provoked or receive greater
                            encouragement from the inhabitants of a neighboring country. Rumors are

                        <p>It has been brought to the attention of the President by influential
                            Jewish groups in this country that the British Government is
                            contemplating the suspension of Jewish immigration into Palestine.
                            American Jewish leaders fear that such suspension may close the only
                            avenue of escape of German and Polish Jews and that it may prove
                            difficult to revoke.</p>
                        <p>Unless you perceive serious objection I should like to have you mention
                            this matter to Mr. Eden<note n="11" xml:id="d519fn11">Anthony Eden,

                            personally and unofficially, stressing the fact that you are not
                            speaking on behalf of your Government. In this connection you could say
                            that you do not of course presume to interfere in any way with the
                            policy which Great Britain may adopt with respect to Palestine or to
                            offer any advice thereon since the administration of that country is
                            entirely a British responsibility. You could add, however, that you
                            believed that the Foreign Minister would wish to know that influential
                            Jewish circles in the United States are deeply concerned at the possible
                            consequences of suspending Jewish immigration into Palestine and that in
                            a personal capacity you are bringing this fact to his attention for such
                            consideration as it may merit.</p>
                        <p>Please telegraph the results of such informal conversation as you may
                            have, marking your reply as personal to me.</p>

                            will be as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“To ascertain the underlying causes of the disturbances which
                                    broke out in Palestine in the middle of April; to inquire into
                                    the manner in which the Mandate for Palestine is being
                                    implemented in relation to the obligations of the Mandatory
                                    towards the Arabs and the Jews respectively; and to ascertain
                                    whether, upon a proper construction of the terms of the Mandate,
                                    either the Arabs or the Jews have any legitimate grievances upon
                                    account of the way in which the Mandate has been, or is being
                                    implemented; and if the commission is satisfied that any such
                                    grievances are well founded, to make recommendations for their
                                    removal and for the prevention of their recurrence.”</p>

                            date the Commission will leave for Palestine, but it was not proposed
                            that the Commission should begin its work in Palestine until order has
                            been restored there.</p>

                            and terms of reference of the Royal Commission of Inquiry indicates that
                            the British Government has abandoned, for the time being at least, any
                            plans it may have had to suspend temporarily Jewish immigration into
                            Palestine? Any information you can obtain discreetly as to the present

                        <p>Senator Copeland of New York called on the Secretary of State yesterday
                            afternoon for the purpose, so he stated, of reporting to the Secretary
                            the results of the observations he had made during the course of a
                            recent visit to Palestine, accompanied by Senator Hastings of Delaware
                            and Senator Austin of Vermont.</p>
                        <p>Senator Copeland stated that he had not sought or desired to be a member
                            of the party making an unofficial investigation of conditions in
                            Palestine, but had agreed to participate upon the understanding that he
                            was to be free to express his views on the situation without any
                            obligation to Mr. Hearst, who, so it appears, financed the trip. The
                            Senator stated that he made this clear to Mr. Hearst himself, who
                            accompanied the party as far as Naples, and that Mr. Hearst “naturally”
                            acceded to Senator Copeland’s wishes in the matter.</p>
                        <p>After expressing his praise of the various Foreign Service officers in
                            the Near East with whom he came in contact, the Senator recounted his
                            experiences with British officials, including the High Commissioner in
                            Palestine, who, according to the Senator’s own statement, granted him
                            every facility for the purpose of making his investigations, even to the
                            extent of furnishing armed troops on trains proceeding to various points
                            in Palestine.</p>
                        <p>The Senator pointed out that he had conferred not only with Jewish
                            circles in Palestine but also with representatives of various Arab
                            groups. He expressed the view that the Arabs in Palestine had profited
                            by Jewish immigration and by the introduction of foreign capital in the
                            country, but he was emphatic in his view that the British authorities
                            had been remiss in the execution of the terms of the Mandate and in
                            having failed to effect a conciliation between the Jewish and Arab
                            populations. He expressed the opinion that Great Britain, instead of
                            devoting herself to her obligations under the Mandate, was using
                            Palestine as a political football for her imperial purposes. He
                            revealed, during the course of his conversation, that he intended to
                            make public statements in the above sense.</p>
                        <p>In reply, the Secretary pointed out that our Consul General in Jerusalem
                            is a thoroughly experienced Near Eastern officer who has served in the
                            Division of Near Eastern Affairs and had charge of Palestine there, and
                            that we had kept ourselves constantly informed of all phases of the
                            present situation. The Secretary furthermore expressed his confidence
                            that the British Government was fully aware of the views entertained in
                            Jewish circles in this country respecting <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451"
                                facs="0516"/>the Palestine problem. He mentioned the fact that
                            recent British reinforcements in Palestine have brought the number of
                            British troops there to about 32,000. He pointed out to the Senator
                            that, although there are in Palestine more than 10,000 American
                            citizens, not one of them has as yet been injured and that all requests
                            made by the American Consul General at Jerusalem for the protection of
                            American nationals and interests in the country had been promptly
                            accorded by the British authorities. He intimated to the Senator that,
                            while keeping constantly on the alert in this matter, it might be
                            delicate to make any demands upon the British Government as to the
                            specific manner in which it should carry out its obligations under the
                            Mandate. In this connection Mr. Hull referred to the debates in the
                            House of Representatives at the time the Joint Resolution was passed in
                            1922 favoring the establishment in Palestine of the National Home for
                            the Jews.<note n="20" xml:id="d528fn20">See <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Congressional Record</hi>, vol. 62, pt. 10, pp. 9799 ff.</note>
                            He referred to the fact that the Resolution as originally drafted stated
                            that this Government “pledges its support” to the establishment of such
                            a home and that, at the instance of Mr. Hughes, then Secretary of State,
                            the above expression was struck out and the Resolution was made to read
                            that the United States “favors” the above-mentioned project.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hull further reminded the Senator that any intervention on the part
                            of this Government might bring forth a suggestion from the British
                            Government that we assume responsibilities for the execution of the
                            Palestine Mandate and recalled that at one time it had even been
                            suggested that this Government accept the Mandate for Palestine. The
                            Senator replied that he felt sure we would run no risk today of having
                            the Mandate offered to us again, in view of the present weakness of the
                            British Government as a result of the Ethiopian fiasco and the recent
                            Anglo-Egyptian Treaty<note n="21" xml:id="d528fn21">Signed at London,

                            increased importance which Palestine had assumed in the defense of

                        <p>At the conclusion of his conversation with the Secretary, the Senator
                            emphasized that he had only come to make a friendly visit upon the
                            Secretary and to report on his visit to Palestine and stated that he was
                            not requesting the Secretary to take any action in the matter. He did,
                            however, feel that the Secretary would be justified, in view of present
                            conditions in Palestine and in view of our Treaty with Great Britain
                            respecting Palestine,<note n="22" xml:id="d528fn22">Signed December 3,

                            thankfulness.</p>
                        <p>Arab circles are jubilant, arguing that while no concrete British
                            promises have been obtainable their 6 months’ protest has not only
                            brought Palestine question before bar of world opinion but has also made
                            of it an Arab question in the solution of which Great Britain will lend
                            sympathetic ear to representations of neighboring Arab rulers.</p>
                        <p>Jewish circles approve settlement because they too have lost economically
                            from strike but disapprove strongly circumstances of termination fearing
                            precedent created for interventions by these Arab rulers.</p>
                        <p>While British military circles regret loss of opportunity to administer
                            much needed lesson, civilian officials believing ultimate solution must
                            be based on conciliation and compromise are relieved that repression
                            through martial law has become unnecessary.</p>

                            violence and gradual dispersing of provincial terrorist bands, that

                        <p>In the House of Commons yesterday the Colonial Secretary rejected, as
                            unjustifiable on economic grounds and as likely to prejudice the work of
                            the Royal Commission, the view that immigration should be suspended. But
                            in view of conditions in Palestine the High Commissioner had been asked
                            to take a conservative view for the immediate future of the absorptive
                            capacity of the country. The British Government accepted his
                            recommendation that the 6 months quota should be reduced from about
                            8,000 to 1,850 including 300 German Jews already in Palestine who had
                            been unable to obtain transfer of their capital from Germany and must
                            technically rank as immigrants. Full text by pouch.</p>

                        <p>It is important, likewise, to note that dependents of persons entering
                            under the labor schedule are not included in the above-mentioned quota.
                            According to official statistics of the Palestine Government, 61,854
                            Jews entered the country in 1935. Of this number only 14,653 came in
                            under the labor schedule. Dependents of this latter group numbered
                            13,076. In other words, persons included in the labor schedule and their
                            dependents accounted for an immigration of 27,000 <pb n="454"
                                xml:id="pg_454" facs="0519"/>while the remaining 44,000 entered
                            comparatively freely tinder other categories such as those mentioned in
                            the first paragraph. Under the action now taken by the British
                            Government it is apparent that persons in these other categories will be
                            permitted to enter as usual. Accordingly immigration into Palestine has
                            not been reduced to anywhere near the extent which is indicated by the
                            bare facts included in this telegram.</p>
                        <p>It is not at all unlikely that Jewish organizations in this country will
                            press us to take some action vis-à-vis the British Government and to
                            urge the latter to rescind its decision and to increase the labor
                            schedule. You are already familiar with the difficult situation in which
                            the British Government is placed because of the hostility manifested
                            toward its Palestine policy by Moslems in various parts of the British
                            Empire. It is apparent that the action which the British Government has
                            now taken is intended as a compromise which will reassure the Arabs and
                            Moslems to some extent and yet at the same time not seriously reduce
                            Jewish immigration. Doubtless some conciliatory move toward the Arabs
                            was considered necessary in order that their cooperation might be
                            obtained in connection with the investigations which the Palestine Royal
                            Commission intends to carry out during its forthcoming trip of
                            inspection.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances it would seem desirable for us to refrain from
                            intervening in any way in this question, particularly since it is now
                            about to receive the attention of the Royal Commission of Inquiry.
                            Moreover, since we ourselves strictly limit our own immigration we are
                            scarcely in a strong position to insist that other countries adjust
                            their immigration laws and regulations to suit the desires of ourselves
                            or a portion of our population.</p>

                            Colonial Secretary’s announcement November 5 that Jewish immigration
                            while restricted on grounds of lessened economic absorptive capacity as
                            to number of authorized labor immigrants, is to be permitted to continue
                            on the same basis as before termination of Arab [general strike].</p>
                        <p>Jewish circles here and abroad while denying existence any basis for
                            reduction of labor schedule view developments as “important victory in
                            principle”. Arab circles while recognizing no contrary <pb n="455"
                                xml:id="pg_455" facs="0520"/>assurances were given unanimously
                            charge British Government with bad faith and yielding to Jewish
                            presumption. Country-wide support is given to Higher Committee decision
                            November 6 “not to cooperate with the Royal Commission” due to arrive
                            Palestine tomorrow morning.</p>
                        <p>Local British circles are inclined privately to consider publication of
                            labor’s schedule at this juncture as politically inept and while
                            regretting Arab decision view it as logically consistent with past
                            action and pronouncements.</p>
                        <p>While events of past month have borne out prognostications my telegram of
                            October 12, noon, regarding gradual cessation of violence and dispersal
                            Arab bands, present developments lead well informed observers to fear
                            recurrence of disorders unless Royal Commission recommends conciliatory
                            gesture.</p>
                        <p>Fostered by former district strike committee, anti-Jewish boycott is
                            gaining strength. While Jewish economists scout its effectiveness other
                            observers sense strong potential danger in the possibilities for
                            trouble-making of this country-wide organization. There seems to be no
                            doubt, however, that the military are now in a position to deal
                            expeditiously with any situation which may arise although unable to
                            prevent isolated acts of terrorism.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Judge Moore</hi>: It seems clear that it would
                            not be proper to transmit to the British Government through our
                            Ambassador in London the document which Rabbi Wise refers to in the
                            attached letter.<note n="26" xml:id="d533fn26">Not printed.</note> An
                            examination of precedents for many years indicates that we have
                            constantly declined to act as a channel of transmission for private
                            organizations of resolutions and petitions destined for foreign
                            governments. We have not only declined to transmit such petitions to
                            local representatives of foreign Powers, but have also refused to
                            transmit documents through our own representatives abroad.</p>
                        <p>In this connection you will recall that during the latter part of August
                            and early September we had numerous letters from Jewish organizations in
                            this country regarding the question of Jewish immigration into
                            Palestine. Nearly all of these letters requested us to <pb n="456"
                                xml:id="pg_456" facs="0521"/>submit petitions and resolutions of
                            protest either to the British Government or to the British Ambassador in
                            Washington. At that time you and the Secretary agreed upon the following
                            statement to be used in reply to such requests: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“With respect to your request to forward notice of your
                                    resolution of protest to the British Government, I must inform
                                    you that well established international practice does not permit
                                    a government to make itself a vehicle for transmission to other
                                    governments of communications from private individuals and
                                    organizations.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">This statement was included in at least sixteen letters
                            to important Jewish organizations in the United States, including the
                            Zionist organization itself.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the document which the Zionist organization now wishes to
                            have transmitted to the British Government it is clear that under the
                            terms of the Palestine Mandate the Zionist organization has a well
                            established channel of transmission. Thus, Article 4 of the Mandate, to
                            the terms of which we consented subject to the provisions of our
                            convention with Great Britain, reads as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“An appropriate Jewish agency shall be recognised as a public
                                    body for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the
                                    Administration of Palestine in such economic, social and other
                                    matters as may affect the establishment of the Jewish national
                                    home and the interests of the Jewish population in Palestine,
                                    and, subject always to the control of the Administration, to
                                    assist and take part in the development of the country.</p>
                                <p>“The Zionist organisation, so long as its organisation and
                                    constitution are in the opinion of the Mandatory appropriate,
                                    shall be recognised as such agency. It shall take steps in
                                    consultation with His Britannic Majesty’s Government to secure
                                    the co-operation of all Jews who are willing to assist in the
                                    establishment of the Jewish national home.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In accordance with the provisions of this Article the Zionist
                            organization for some years acted as the Jewish agency. About six years
                            ago, however, an agreement was entered into between the Zionists and
                            non-Zionists providing for cooperation between the two on the Jewish
                            agency. Thus both Zionists and non-Zionists, of whom there are many
                            among the Jews of the world, each have an opportunity to present their
                            views to the British Government and to the League of Nations through the
                            established and recognized channel of the Jewish agency. Unless
                            otherwise decided by a three-fourths vote of the Council of the Jewish
                            agency, the President of the Zionist organization is <hi rend="italic"
                                >ipso facto</hi> President of the agency. As a matter of fact, Dr.
                            Chaim Weizmann is now President of both organizations. It is perfectly
                            clear, therefore, that the Zionist organization of America and the
                            Zionist organizations of other countries have a well established channel
                            of approach to the British Government. This channel is <pb n="457"
                                xml:id="pg_457" facs="0522"/>established by the terms of the Mandate
                            to which we have consented, and it might even be considered that it
                            would be contrary to the provisions of the Mandate for us to act as a
                            channel of communication with the British Government when such a channel
                            has already been established through the Jewish agency. That the agency
                            is most active in offering advice not only to the Palestine
                            administration but to the British Government itself is clear from the
                            various reports of the British Government on the administration of the
                            Mandate.</p>
                        <p>With respect to immigration Article 6 of the Mandate provides for close
                            cooperation between the Jewish agency and the Palestine Government. The
                            Article in question reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Administration of Palestine, while ensuring that the rights
                                    and position of other sections of the population are not
                                    prejudiced, shall facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable
                                    conditions and shall encourage in co-operation with the Jewish
                                    agency referred to in Article 4, close settlement by Jews on the
                                    land, including State lands and waste lands not required for
                                    public purposes.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Since Rabbi Wise’s proposed communication to the British
                            Government undoubtedly has to do largely with immigration, it is clear
                            that here again the Zionist organization of America has a legal and
                            established channel of approach through the Jewish agency.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, you will recall that a Royal Commission of Inquiry composed
                            of distinguished British statesmen is now in Palestine to investigate
                            and report upon the situation in that country. That Commission is in
                            close touch with the Zionist agency in Palestine. While this whole
                            question is <hi rend="italic">sub judice</hi> it would seem altogether
                            inappropriate for this Government to intervene in the matter by acting
                            as a channel of transmission for the views of the Zionist organization
                            in the United States. It might well be held by the British Government
                            that such action would constitute undue interference in this most
                            delicate problem and would tend to prejudice the case in the eyes of the
                            Commission of Inquiry.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the whole question of the relations between this
                            Government and the Zionist organization it is perhaps pertinent to quote
                            from a conversation which Secretary of State Kellogg had with Dr.
                            Weizmann, now and then President of the Zionist organization, on
                            December 1, 1926. Dr. Weizmann had called to request the approval of the
                            Secretary of State with respect to the formation of a committee to
                            further the Zionist movement in Palestine. Dr. Weizmann had mentioned
                            that he had seen the President who had told him that he would try to
                            find some way to aid him. In reply to Dr. Weizmann’s request Secretary
                            Kellogg records his conversation as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I said of course I did not know what the President had said but
                                    the Zionist Movement was a private enterprise only requiring the
                                        <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0523"/>consent of the
                                    British Government; that the British Government controlled
                                    Palestine under a mandate and all we had to do with it was to
                                    stipulate in our treaty that American citizens should enjoy the
                                    same rights as the nationals of countries members of the League
                                    of Nations party to the mandate. He said of course that was
                                    true.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In other words, as long as ten years ago it is clear that the Secretary
                            of State held to the view that the sole purpose of our Mandate
                            Convention was to obtain for our citizens in Palestine the same rights
                            as those enjoyed by nationals of countries members of the League of
                            Nations who are party to the Mandate. I believe it can be established to
                            be equally clear that it was not the intention of this Mandate
                            Convention to entangle us in any other way in the most delicate problem
                            of Palestine.</p>

                        <p>This morning Rabbi Stephen S. Wise and Robert Szold, a lawyer who is
                            acting with him in connection with questions pertaining to Palestine,

                            attention certain printed statements which I found to be addressed to
                            the British Commission now functioning in Palestine.</p>
                        <p>When they signified their desire that these statements should be brought
                            to the attention of the British Government, I reminded them that
                            Secretary Hull some time ago, in considering a request that we should
                            diplomatically bring certain petitions and resolutions pertaining to the
                            Palestine situation to the attention of the British Government, had
                            replied as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“With respect to your request to forward notice of your
                                    resolution of protest to the British Government, I must inform
                                    you that well established international practice does not permit
                                    a government to make itself a vehicle for transmission to other
                                    governments of communications from private individuals and
                                    organizations.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Rabbi Wise immediately said that he recognizes the reasonableness of this
                            rule and that without it our Government might make itself a sort of post
                            office department for the transmission of all sorts of documents to the
                            British Government. In addition to what was said on the point just
                            mentioned, I reminded Rabbi Wise that the provisions of Article 4 of the
                            Mandate established the Zionist Organization as an Agency authorized to
                            consult with the British Government and suggested that there is thus
                            already a usable vehicle of communication and to this he assented.</p>
                        <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0524"/>
                        <p>The upshot of the conversation was there were left with us, simply for
                            our own information, copies of the printed statements and that I said,
                            in answer to a question, that we, of course, cannot object to any
                            organization or citizen communicating in any way it may desire with
                            Ambassador Bingham, but that I would inform the Ambassador that we are
                            not instigating any such communication and, of course, are not expecting
                            or desiring him to violate the rule and practice heretofore indicated by
                            Secretary Hull.</p>
                        <p>Finally Mr. Szold said that, in the event the British Commission should
                            limit Jewish immigration to Palestine not for economic reasons, but for
                            political reasons, in his judgment, there would arise under the treaty a
                            legal question which would require action by our Government. He and
                            Rabbi Wise were quite satisfied when I told them that, in advance of
                            knowing what the Commission may determine, it was premature to talk
                            about any possible legal question in which our Government might or might
                            not be interested.</p>

                            French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the American Government consistently
                            maintained that the wording of the above mentioned statements clearly
                            guarantees to American educational and philanthropical institutions free
                            customs entry, without limitation as to either the quantity or the

                        <p>The American Government has further consistently maintained that the

                            November 4, 1930, as appears from a communication addressed by the
                            French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the American Embassy under date of
                            March 10, 1931. A copy of this note is enclosed for ready

                            Foreign Affairs in its note of March 10, 1931, Mr. Steger trusts that M.

                                    <ref target="#pg_460">p. 460</ref>.</note> reporting that a
                            decree, No. 292/LR, issued by the French High Commissioner on December
                            20, 1934, appears to constitute a unilateral withdrawal of rights
                            assured, by virtue of an agreement concluded between the American and
                            French Governments in 1923, to American educational and philanthropic
                            institutions in the Levant States under French Mandate. As an enclosure
                            to this despatch was transmitted a copy of a note sent, under date of
                            January 25, 1935, to the French High Commissioner, protesting against
                            this action.</p>
                        <p>I now have the honor to transmit a copy, with translation, of the High
                            Commissioner’s note of May 8th, 1935, replying to the observations made
                            in my note of January 25th.</p>
                        <p>A perusal of this note will show that it does not constitute a reply to
                            the points raised in my communication of January 25th: passing over
                            without comment the legal status of the matter as outlined by me, M. de
                            Martel has merely attempted to justify his action by explaining the
                            factors which led him to the conclusion that such action was necessary
                            as a matter of policy.</p>
                        <p>For the information of the Department, I wish to make the following
                            comment on several points mentioned in the present communication of the
                            High Commission:</p>
                        <p>It is to be noted that the High Commissioner adopts the standpoint that
                            the French Foreign Office, in accepting, in its note of March 10, 1931,
                            the contention of the American Government, was not acknowledging the
                            justice of the American claims, but was, “in a spirit of broad
                            liberality,” granting a request of the American Embassy. Consequently,
                            as a corollary to this standpoint, the High Commissioner feels that, the
                            necessity having arisen, this voluntary concession may be withdrawn at
                            will. It is my personal opinion that the Department will hardly be
                            disposed to accept this viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, it is stated that the withdrawal of privileges from
                            the institutions in question was a necessary concession to public
                            opinion, as represented by the demands of a committee from the Lebanese
                            Chamber of Deputies. This statement is, to say the least, misleading. It
                            is true that the Chamber sent a Committee to request “a restriction of
                            privileges.” The privileges in question, however, were those enjoyed by
                            concessionary societies, by French civilians in <pb n="463"
                                xml:id="pg_463" facs="0528"/>making purchases from the military
                            cooperative stores, and in connection with duty-free importation of
                            automobiles by officials. I have inquired of one of the members of this
                            committee, who informs me that no mention whatsoever was made of the
                            customs privileges accorded to educational and philanthropic
                            institutions.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it is stated that certain local—i. e., Lebanese or
                            Syrian—institutions had abused the privileges granted them, and that it
                            was consequently necessary to withdraw these privileges from all
                            institutions. Personally, I fail to see the logic of this statement; nor
                            do I know of any reason why the privileges granted might not be
                            withdrawn individually from those institutions which have abused
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The only logical contention advanced in the note consists in the argument
                            that the assurances given to the Italian Government provide for “customs
                            exemption”, and that this assurance might be interpreted to contemplate
                            a continuation—but not an extension—of the privileges guaranteed under
                            Ottoman law, which privileges France was required, by the terms of the
                            Mandate, to safeguard. It is true that under Ottoman legislation dating
                            back to 1864 both the amounts and the nature of the articles to be
                            imported duty-free were subject to limitation; and very probably the
                            French Government did not anticipate that the assurances given to the
                            Italian Government in the accord of September 29, 1923 should be
                            construed as extending these privileges indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the fact remains that the French Foreign Office, in its
                            note of March 10, 1931, accepted such a construction, thus in effect
                            incorporating this interpretation into the agreement reached between the
                            two Governments on November 2, 1923.</p>
                        <p>In a recent conversation with M. Kieffer, Acting Chief of the Political
                            Bureau of the French High Commission, I expressed the opinion that the
                            note of May 8th did not constitute a reply to the question of principle
                            involved; that the withdrawal of these privileges, without consultation
                            with the American Government, constituted an unfortunate precedent; and
                            that, irrespective of the validity of the reasons which led the High
                            Commission to the conclusion that this action was desirable, such a
                            precedent could hardly be accepted without comment by the American
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I then repeated my formerly expressed opinion that the Department of
                            State is far from desiring to embarrass the Mandatory Power in the
                            pursuit of the best interests of the States under Mandate, and that it
                            would undoubtedly be willing to give sympathetic consideration to any
                            request of the French Government to enter into conversations with a view
                            to arriving at a new agreement which would safeguard the interests of
                            all concerned.</p>
                        <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0529"/>
                        <p>Consequently I suggested that the High Commission’s note of May 8th be
                            considered, not as a final reply to my representations, but as an
                            expression of the desire of the High Commission that such conversations
                            be initiated. I added that, until or unless a new agreement should be
                            reached, the rights assured to American institutions under the accord
                            concluded between the two Governments in 1923 should, in my opinion, be
                            considered as existing without modification.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kieffer, while expressing the opinion that such conversations would
                            hardly result in a modification of the present standpoint of the French
                            High Commission, agreed with my suggestion. Under the circumstances I am
                            refraining from further written communications on the subject, pending
                            instructions from the Department.</p>
                        <p>From the attitude of Mr. Kieffer I judge that the French High
                            Commissioner, although realizing the weakness of his legal position,
                            will be most reluctant to acknowledge himself in error, and to make an
                            open admission of this fact by a prompt modification of the decree which
                            he has so recently issued. Consequently it is probably advisable that
                            further representations be made direct to the French Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs through the American Embassy at Paris. A copy of this despatch
                            is being sent to the Embassy at Paris for its information.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Consul</hi>: In your note of January 25th,
                                last, you were kind enough to set forth certain views regarding
                                Decree No. 292/LR of December 20, 1934, regulating customs
                                immunities on importations made by religious communities,
                                evangelical missions, educational institutions and charitable
                                societies. You called attention to the conversations preliminary to
                                the signing, on April 4, 1924, of a convention between the United
                                States and France relative to the rights of the two Governments and
                                their nationals in Syria and the Lebanon, particularly to a letter
                                by which M. Poincaré, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, assured, on
                                November 2, 1923, the American Government that its nationals would
                                enjoy all privileges granted to those of any other country. Among
                                those privileges were certain assurances given to the Italian
                                Government in an agreement dated September 29, 1923, of which you
                                quoted the main points.</p>
                            <p>The interpretation of these points having given rise to an exchange
                                of correspondence, you attached to your letter a copy of a note,
                                dated March 10, 1931, by which the Minister of Foreign Affairs
                                informed the <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0530"/>American
                                Embassy at Paris that, in order to comply with his expressed desire,
                                exemption of customs duties would be granted on importations made by
                                American institutions, without setting an annual quota, and with the
                                sole reservation of proof as to their destination and use.</p>
                            <p>You maintained that, under these circumstances, American institutions
                                should be exempt from the provisions of Decree No. 292/LR.</p>
                            <p>In the course of a conversation at the High Commission the reasons
                                for which the latter had been obliged to issue the decree in
                                question were explained to you.</p>
                            <p>You then expressed the desire to have a written confirmation hereof.
                                This note serves that purpose.</p>
                            <p>It behooves us first of all to recall that the immunities enjoyed by
                                educational, philanthropic and religious institutions in the States
                                under French Mandate date back to the Ottoman Empire. Under the
                                terms of the Mandate, France had to safeguard the privileges
                                formerly enjoyed by these institutions.</p>
                            <p>However, the Ottoman customs regulations of 1910 did not provide for
                                illimited franchise privileges; the kinds of articles to be imported
                                free of duty were determined, and their value could not exceed a
                                certain maximum.</p>
                            <p>By Decree No. 1734 dated December 22, 1922,<note n="10"

                                Commission set forth the regulations applicable in this connection
                                in the States under French Mandate. As during the Ottoman régime,
                                the articles to be admitted free of duty were set forth in general
                                terms, and their value limited.</p>
                            <p>By the agreement of September 29, 1923, the French Government granted
                                to Italy “customs franchise” for its institutions in the Levant. One
                                could reasonably argue the point whether it was a question of
                                illimited franchise or franchise depending on the regulations then
                                in force. But a controversy on this point would have no practical
                                bearing, since the mandatory power was seeking to facilitate the
                                functioning of foreign institutions by interpreting the franchise
                                regulations in a very liberal spirit. It is in this spirit that,
                                according to the very terms of the letter of March 10, 1931, France
                                announced to the American Embassy at Paris that the customs
                                administration at Beirut would receive instructions designed to
                                satisfy the desire expressed by the Embassy.</p>
                            <p>But, however desirous the mandatory power may be of generosity in
                                this regard towards foreign institutions, it must needs take into
                                consideration certain reactions of public opinion. It cannot have
                                escaped your Consulate General that this opinion has arisen more and
                                more violently against the régime of exemptions.</p>
                            <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0531"/>
                            <p>The Lebanese Chamber, having of its own accord taken cognizance of
                                this problem, sent to the High Commission a committee which exposed
                                its grievances, among which figured a demand for restriction of the
                                privileges, and there is no doubt that the complaints emanating from
                                those various circles are not devoid of foundation since, under
                                cover of immunities, certain local institutions have not hesitated
                                to abuse these privileges.</p>
                            <p>But to withdraw immunities from local institutions alone would amount
                                to establishing in favor of foreigners a privilege which the Ottoman
                                régime itself had not reserved to them. This innovation would be
                                inconceivable in the face of existing opinion. The High Commission
                                found itself under the obligation of having recourse to conciliatory
                                measures and of establishing a regulation capable of removing all
                                cause for legitimate complaints, at the same time safeguarding, in
                                the largest possible measure, the interests of foreign
                                institutions.</p>
                            <p>The text already applied by the Palestinian authorities was inspired
                                by the same thought.</p>
                            <p>The question which you brought up is therefore not a problem of right
                                or interpretation of text; it has above all a character of political
                                expediency (<hi rend="italic">un caractère d’opportunité
                                    politique</hi>).</p>
                            <p>A régime of illimited exemptions—or their limitation to foreigners
                                alone—is impossible in the face of opinion. In the presence of a
                                problem which should be solved, American and French interests are
                                eminently solidary, and I do not doubt that with the help of these
                                explanations the American Government will admit that Decree No.
                                292/LR constitutes a reasonable and carefully studied regulation,
                                designed to safeguard the proper functioning of foreign institutions
                                by placing the régime of exemptions above criticism.</p>

                            1935, regarding customs privileges of American educational and
                            philanthropic institutions in Syria and the Lebanon, copies of which
                            were transmitted direct to the Embassy by the American Consul at
                            Beirut.</p>
                        <p>With the first of these despatches the Consul enclosed a copy of his note
                            of January 25, 1935, addressed to the French High Commissioner <pb
                                n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0532"/>at Beirut. Since this note
                            appeared accurately to set forth the viewpoint of this Government, the
                            Department expressed its approval thereof in an instruction to the

                            reply of May 8, 1935, a copy of which was enclosed with despatch No.
                            887, fails however, to furnish an adequate answer to several of the
                            points raised in the Consul’s original communication.</p>
                        <p>You are requested, therefore, to bring a copy of Mr. Steger’s note to the
                            attention of the Foreign Office and explain that this Government
                            considers that the High Commissioner’s note of May 8, 1933 [<hi
                                rend="italic">1935</hi>], is an inadequate reply, and that it cannot
                            admit that rights of American nationals in Syria, recognized by official
                            declarations of the French Government under dates of November 2, 1923
                            and March 10, 1931, may be withdrawn or impaired without the consent of
                            this Government. You may point out at the same time that this Government
                            has no desire to embarrass the French mandatory authorities in Syria and
                            the Lebanon in their fiscal policies and that it will be glad to
                            consider sympathetically any reasonable proposals which the French
                            Government may wish to make with a view to the final settlement of this

                            note sent by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of France (Direction
                            Politique) on March 10, 1931, with respect to the customs privileges of
                            American educational and philanthropic institutions in Syria and the
                            Lebanon. Apparently the provisions of the <hi rend="italic">Arrêté</hi>
                            No. 292/LR of December 20, 1934, constitute a limitation to the

                            institutions in the Levant States under French Mandate, and the Embassy
                            has the honor to transmit herewith a copy of a note in the matter which
                            was forwarded on January 25, 1935, by the American Consul at Beirut to
                            His Excellency the French High Commissioner; this note sets forth
                            accurately the viewpoint of the American Government in the matter.</p>

                            the American Consul at Beirut, which, in the opinion of the American
                            Government, is an inadequate reply to the Consul’s aforementioned
                            note.</p>
                        <p>The American Government cannot admit that rights of American nationals in
                            Syria, recognized by official declarations of the French Government
                            under dates of November 2, 1923, and March 10, 1931, may be withdrawn or
                            impaired without the consent of the Government, this having apparently

                        <p>I called today upon M. Chauvel,<note n="15" xml:id="d539fn15">Jean Michel
                                Henri Chauvel, Secretary of Embassy in the African and Levant
                                Section of the French Foreign Office.</note> at the suggestion of
                            his immediate superior, M. de St. Quentin.<note n="16" xml:id="d539fn16"
                                >Doynel de Saint Quentin, Chief of the African and Levant Section of
                                the French Foreign Office.</note></p>
                        <p>M. Chauvel started the conversation by referring to the last paragraph of
                            the Embassy’s note No. 1414 of August 19, 1935, which is practically a
                            verbatim quotation of the last seven lines of Instruction No. 1001 dated
                            August 6, 1935. The Foreign Office official claimed to interpret the
                            passage in question as a statement by the American Government that it
                            had no objection to the withdrawal of the customs privileges by the <hi
                                rend="italic">Arrêté</hi> of December 20, 1934, merely resenting the
                            way in which the restrictions were invoked, namely, without the courtesy
                            of prior consultation with the American Government. He said that his
                            Ministry would be pleased to apologize for this lack of courtesy and to
                            “consult” the American Government, provided the latter would assure
                            acquiescence in the spirit and contents of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Arrêté</hi> in question. I remarked that such was not my
                            understanding of the American Government’s attitude in the matter. He
                            then asked <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0534"/>me just what
                            Washington would accept, to which I replied that the Embassy had
                            received no intimation from the Department in this matter and that it
                            would be up to the French authorities to make the initial
                            suggestions.</p>
                        <p>M. Chauvel then said that it would be very difficult for the Foreign
                            Office to make suggestions without knowing just what would be acceptable
                            to us. He reverted to the passage in the communication of May 8, 1935
                            (No. 4050), from High Commissioner de Martel to Consul Steger, stressing
                            particularly paragraphs 10 and 11 and saying that according to High
                            Commissioner de Martel, there is a serious movement among the Syrian and
                            Lebanese merchants to reduce duty-free imports of whatever nature (for
                            obvious reasons), this movement having been fanned by exaggerated use of
                            free entry privileges by Italian institutions.</p>
                        <p>Parenthetically, M. Chauvel related here a rather interesting anecdote.
                            The Italian institutions imported shoes for their Syrian school
                            children—a reasonable enough action according to previous privileges—but
                            they insisted upon importing simultaneously large quantities of black
                            shirts in order that these same children might parade the streets in
                            true Fascist style and equipment.</p>
                        <p>The French official then stated it was his understanding that the free
                            entry restrictions involved by the <hi rend="italic">Arrêté</hi> do not
                            cause any financial difficulties to the American institutions in the
                            mandated territories in question. He said he would suggest to High
                            Commissioner de Martel that he get into personal contact with M.
                                Deutsch,<note n="17" xml:id="d539fn17">Apparently a reference to
                                Bayard Dodge, President of the American University at Beirut.</note>
                            who is apparently the head of the American missions in the territories
                            involved, and ascertain just what commodities his organization would
                            find desirable to import free of duty, and that thereafter either the
                                <hi rend="italic">Arrêté</hi> might be modified or an exchange of
                            correspondence between the Foreign Office and the Embassy could take
                            place whereby facilities would be accorded.</p>
                        <p>M. Chauvel repeated on a number of occasions that the mandatory
                            authorities are placed in a very difficult position on account of the
                            American Government’s objection to the <hi rend="italic">Arrêté</hi>, as
                            final French action with respect to similar complaint by the Italian
                            Government would perforce have to be based on whatever advantages we may
                            obtain. He said also that local conditions had absolutely required some
                            sort of restriction as that involved in the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Arrêté</hi> in question.</p>
                        <p>I told the Foreign Office official that my Government obviously desired
                            to be reasonable, that I would communicate the memorandum of my
                            conversation with him to the Department of State for consideration,
                            sending a copy thereof to the American Consul at Beirut.</p>

                            inquiry is made as to whether it would not be possible to enter into an

                            merely to complete the Ministry’s files in the matter. He added that no

                            <p>By note No. 1414 dated August 19, 1935, the Embassy of the United
                                States of America informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the
                                United States Government, although contesting the principle of the
                                decision taken by the High Commissariat of France at Beirut with
                                regard to exemption from customs duty in favor of American
                                institutions in the Levant, did not wish to embarrass the mandatory
                                authority’s fiscal regime and would examine in a friendly spirit any
                                reasonable proposal submitted to it with a view to the settlement of
                                the matter.</p>
                            <p>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs thanks the Embassy for this
                                communication, and has the honor to state that an informal exchange
                                of views would appear to it to offer opportunity to determine the
                                nature of the accord to be arrived at. Should the Embassy share this
                                opinion, the Sub-Division of Africa-Levant would place itself at the
                                disposal of the person charged with discussing the matter with
                                it.</p>

                            No. 852 of March 18, 1935,<note n="19" xml:id="d541fn19">Not
                                printed.</note> and to subsequent correspondence with regard to the
                            French High Commissioner’s Decree No. 292/LB of December 20, 1934, which
                            limits rights previously assured to American educational and
                            philanthropic institutions in the territory under French Mandate.</p>
                        <p>Article 4 of the Decree in question denies to the institutions in
                            question the privilege of free entry of articles imported from a
                            country, other than the United States, which is not a member of the
                            League of Nations. Especial attention was not called to this provision
                            in my previous reports, inasmuch as it did not at the time appear to
                            affect especially any American institutions in this country.</p>
                        <p>Now, however, my attention has been directed to the fact that the
                            American University of Beirut imports considerable quantities of medical
                            and other scientific instruments and supplies from Germany, and that,
                            unless special arrangements are made in the meantime, imports from that
                            country will not be admitted free of duty after the effective date of
                            Germany’s withdrawal from the League.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the prohibition of duty-free imports from Germany has not yet
                            become effective; and inasmuch as the protest of the American Government
                            against the provisions of the Decree in question is being presented
                            through the American Embassy at Paris, I shall, in the absence of
                            specific instructions to that effect, make no representations to the
                            French High Commission at Beirut.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the Department may not feel inclined to make
                            representations for the purpose of enabling the University to continue
                            to import from Germany articles which, in most instances at least, might
                            equally well be imported from the United States. However, inasmuch as
                            the assurances given to the American Embassy at Paris, under dates of
                            November 2, 1923, and March 10, 1931, make no mention of limitation of
                            imports with respect to the country of origin of the merchandise, it is
                            believed that the provisions of Article 4 of the Decree should be
                            brought specifically to the attention of the Department.</p>
                        <p>It is respectfully requested that the Consulate General be informed in
                            the event that the Department should deem it advisable to include this
                            point in the representations which it is now making to the French
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I take this occasion to report that there has been no change in the local
                            situation since the date of my despatch No. 887 of May 25, 1935.</p>

                            consideration of the situation by the French High Commissioner at
                            Beirut, and discussions between him and the representatives of American
                            missions in this country.</p>
                        <p>I now have the honor to enclose a memorandum of a conversation which I
                            had yesterday with M. Kieffer, Chief of the Political Bureau of the High
                            Commission. It will be seen that, although the Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs duly transmitted to the French High Commissioner the suggestion
                            that he initiate negotiations here, the latter has definitely declined
                            to take any such action.</p>
                        <p>My opinions as to the general situation, based on local observations and
                            frequent discussion with competent officials of the French High
                            Commission, have been duly communicated to the Department in previous
                            despatches. I now feel it incumbent upon me to express the opinion that
                            the officials of the High Commission, and possibly also those of the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Paris, are deliberately evading the
                            issue. They realize that their legal position is weak; however, the
                            provisions of <hi rend="italic">Arrêté</hi> No. 292/LR of December 20,
                            1934, constitute a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi>, and the High
                            Commission has every interest in postponing, rather than in meeting, the
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>It is my understanding that the Department takes the attitude that the
                            provisions of <hi rend="italic">Arrêté</hi> No. 292/LR, being in
                            contravention of treaty rights, are inapplicable to American
                            institutions, and that, pending the consent of the American Government
                            to eventual modifications, the rights formerly enjoyed by these
                            institutions continue <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0538"/>to exist
                            unimpaired. I am inclined to believe that if the Department should
                            insist strongly upon practical recognition of this legal situation, the
                            French Government would find in this insistence an incentive for
                            altering its present policy of procrastination.</p>

                            <p>I called this morning on M. Kieffer, Chief of the Political Bureau of
                                the French High Commission, and inquired if the High Commission had
                                received recommendations of the French Foreign Office to the effect
                                that the High Commissioner initiate conversations with
                                representatives of the American missions in this country, with a
                                view to adjusting the differences which had arisen as a result of
                                the application of the High Commissioner’s Decree No. 292/LR of
                                December 20, 1934, limiting the customs privileges enjoyed by
                                philanthropic and educational institutions.</p>
                            <p>M. Kieffer replied that the High Commissioner had received such
                                recommendations from the Foreign Office, but had interpreted them to
                                mean that the initiative for such conversations should come from the
                                American interests concerned; and that he had recently replied to
                                the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that no one had approached
                                the High Commission on the subject.</p>
                            <p>I replied that his evaluation of the position appeared to be at
                                variance with my own and with my understanding of the position of
                                the American Government; that the position of the State Department
                                was that an international agreement had been arbitrarily altered by
                                the Mandatory authorities without the consent of the American
                                Government, and that, until the consent of the American Government
                                should have been obtained, the terms of the assurances previously
                                given by the French Government must be considered as being still in
                                force. Such being the case, I added, the French authorities, if they
                                desired to effect a change in the legal situation could hardly
                                expect that the American Government should take the initiative by
                                proposing a reduction of privileges guaranteed to American
                                institutions by the existing agreement. It was rather, I stated, the
                                Mandatory authorities who should act with a view to ascertaining
                                whether the Government of the United States were willing to recede
                                from the position taken in my note of January 25, 1935.</p>
                            <p>From this point the conversation turned to the more general question
                                of the right of the French High Commission to withdraw the
                                privileges previously agreed upon between the two Governments. <pb
                                    n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0539"/>From M. Kieffer’s
                                statements it appears that the chief, if not the only argument in
                                legal justification of the stand of the High Commission is that
                                advanced in paragraphs 6 to 9 of the High Commission’s note of May
                                8, 1935. (My comment on the argument will be found in paragraphs 8
                                and 9, page 3, of my despatch No. 887 of May 25, 1935.) M. Kieffer,
                                while admitting that the French Foreign Office, in its note of March
                                10, 1931, accepted the contention of the American Government that
                                the franchise granted to the institutions should be unlimited, now
                                argues that the French Government, while bound under the terms of
                                the Mandate to preserve privileges enjoyed by foreigners under the
                                Ottoman régime, had no right to grant an extension of those
                                privileges. According to this argument, the assurances given in
                                1931, being contrary to the terms and the spirit of the Mandate,
                                must be considered as null and void.</p>
                            <p>Aside from this legal argument, the only justification advanced is
                                that of expediency. In connection with this point, I merely repeated
                                to M. Kieffer my previous statement that the American Government had
                                expressed its willingness to give sympathetic consideration to the
                                views of the Mandatory authorities, but that it still held to its
                                standpoint that any modification of existing American rights must
                                result from an agreement between the two parties rather than from
                                unilateral action.</p>
                            <p>M. Kieffer then, reverting to my former statement that discussions of
                                possible modifications should be initiated by the High Commission,
                                promised to discuss the matter again with the French High
                                Commissioner and to inform me of the results.</p>

                                Lebanon.</p>
                            <p>I told him that it seemed to me that the affair had resolved itself
                                into a question of principle and that if a principle could be
                                established, namely, that the French Government cannot unilaterally
                                withdraw or impair those privileges and rights granted under
                                treaties, <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0541"/>should France ask
                                the American Government’s consent to a certain series of
                                modifications of the practice which existed prior to such unilateral
                                action, no doubt some arrangement might be worked out.</p>
                            <p>M. Chauvel said that the details of an arrangement would certainly
                                have to be worked out on the spot in Syria, since there, one had the
                                representatives of the injured parties.</p>
                            <p>I told him that, while that might be the case, I was most anxious
                                before I went out there to have the matter of principle settled, and
                                as at the present moment France was protesting with all its might
                                against a unilateral action by Germany in violation of treaties, I
                                did not think the French would wish to be proponents of any other
                                policy in one of its mandates.</p>
                            <p>M. Chauvel said that M. de Martel, the High Commissioner, was
                                arriving in Paris on March 25th, and that he would be glad to
                                arrange for him to see me at that time when perhaps in a conference
                                something might be brought to a head.</p>
                            <p>I said that for this and for other reasons I would be glad to see the
                                High Commissioner.</p>

                                found in Department files.</note> relative to the customs privileges
                            of American educational and philanthropic institutions in Syria and
                            Lebanon, the Embassy of the United States of America was good enough to
                            inform the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Government of the
                            United States, apprised of the <hi rend="italic">Départment’s</hi> note
                            dated November 8, 1935, continued to hold the view that the privileges
                            of these establishments could not be unilaterally withdrawn or modified,
                            and that any proposal tending to this end should be initiated by the
                            French Government.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honor to advise the Embassy of
                            the United States of America that the question thus propounded has had
                            its closest attention. The Ministry, nevertheless, in the absence of
                            more precise details relative to the point of view of the Government of
                            the United States, is not in a position to determine the nature of the
                            proposals which that Government would like to have laid before it.</p>
                        <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0542"/>
                        <p>The object of the above-mentioned note of November 8, 1935, was to bring
                            about, through informal conversations, an examination of the disputed
                            subject. The discussions which took place between a representative of
                            the Embassy and the <hi rend="italic">Services du Départment</hi>
                            resulted solely in establishing the fact that neither the Embassy nor
                            the <hi rend="italic">Départment</hi> had sufficient basic information
                            to evaluate the practical importance of the modifications made in the
                            regime which, before December 20, 1934, the American institutions
                            enjoyed. The suggestion was then made to leave to local representatives
                            of these institutions the task of presenting their point of view to the
                            High Commissariat, the necessary study to be made on the spot.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy’s note No. 1790 of March 2 last brings the question back to
                            its starting point.</p>
                        <p>Such being the situation, the Ministry believes it should indicate as
                            follows the position of the French Government.</p>
                        <p>Either the objection of the Government of the United States to the decree
                            of December 20, 1934, has to do with the procedure followed in this case
                            by the Mandatory Authority, in which event the French Government is
                            entirely disposed to give to the regime established by this decision a
                            contractual character by means of a Franco-American accord covering the
                            application of this regime to American institutions.</p>
                        <p>Or the reservations of the Government of the United States have to do
                            with the nature of this regime, and under this second supposition the
                            French Government would not be prepared to submit any proposal
                            whatsoever unless these reserves were precisely stated.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is constrained to add that any
                            modifications of importance made to the advantage of American
                            institutions only in the regime instituted on December 20, 1934, would
                            present the most serious difficulties. The customs privileges granted to
                            foreign institutions have in fact become a question of public opinion in
                            the States of the Levant under French mandate. The Mandatory Authority,
                            anxious to maintain for these institutions the facilities which they
                            need, but at the same time desirous of protecting them from being
                            reproached for benefiting from excessive privileges, to the detriment of
                            public finances, has considered it necessary to codify these privileges,
                            taking into account the practical needs of the establishments involved.
                            It is a question, in short, of a consolidation destined to guarantee for
                            the future the maintenance of these privileges which the local powers,
                            in the absence of precise regulations, would not fail to call in
                            question again. This end can only be attained, however, if the same
                            regulations apply without distinction to Lebanese and to all foreign
                            establishments.</p>

                        <p>The regime instituted on December 20, 1934, has been minutely studied by
                            the competent services, and the French institutions, very numerous and
                            extremely important in the Levant, declare that for their part they are
                            satisfied.</p>

                            1923, particular pledges, referred to in the letter addressed by M.

                            as it is concerned, to formulating reserves of principle, has declared
                            that it appreciates the reasons of political expediency which determined
                            the decision of December 20, 1934 and has not insisted that a special
                            regime be maintained for it.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes that the Government of the United
                            States of America, taking into consideration the circumstances above
                            described, will be satisfied in seeing its institutions enjoy, under the
                            new regime, the same treatment as that accorded the Italian institutions
                            which the above referred to letter of my predecessor described.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the Department’s
                            instruction of June 10, 1936 (File No. 690 D.11241/36),<note n="25"

                            under reference apparently crossed this Consulate General’s despatch No.
                            5 of May 15, 1936,<note n="26" xml:id="d546fn26"><hi rend="italic"

                            medicine and pharmacy in the Lebanese Republic. These modifications
                            appear to be completely satisfactory to all concerned.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the privileges of American educational and philanthropic
                            institutions in Syria, the Department has no doubt received from Paris a
                            copy of the note of the French Foreign Office dated May 31, 1936,
                            stating that the French Government is prepared to enter into a further
                            agreement with the Government of the United States upon the subject of
                            the customs privileges to be granted to such institutions, provided the
                            Government of the United States is willing to conclude an agreement
                            embodying the regime set up by the decree of December 20, 1934.</p>
                        <p>Such an agreement would merely mean giving legal force to a unilateral
                            action of the Mandatory authority taken without consultation <pb n="479"
                                xml:id="pg_479" facs="0544"/>with or the consent of the United
                            States and, on this basis, would seem unwise. However, any slight
                            modification of the existing regime which could be obtained in such an
                            agreement would be sufficient to justify action along these lines.</p>
                        <p>In so far as the regime itself is concerned, I have discussed the matter
                            thoroughly with the authorities of the American University and the
                            American Mission here who do not find that the regime now being applied
                            subjects them to any undue hardships. President Dodge stated that, in so
                            far as the restriction of the importation of foodstuffs is concerned, he
                            was thoroughly in agreement with the reasoning of the Lebanese
                            authorities that competition of native products offered by free
                            importation was not justifiable. The complaints of the University have
                            been of an administrative character rather than one of principle, and
                            certain decisions of the customs under the French Decree No. 292/LR of
                            December 20, 1934, have seemed arbitrary and disadvantageous to the
                            University, but in each case an appeal to higher authority has
                            straightened the matter out to the University’s satisfaction. Therefore,
                            from all information obtainable, it cannot be said that legitimate
                            American interests have suffered by the application of the decree. It
                            can only be added that unilateral modification of treaty rights is
                            unjustified.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I would suggest that a proposal be made to the French
                            Government for an exchange of notes clarifying and specifying the
                            privileges to be granted to American schools, orphanages, asylums,
                            hospitals and dispensaries, arising out of the exchange of notes between
                            M. Poincaré and Ambassador Herrick, dated Paris, respectively, November
                            2, 1923, and December 18, 1923.<note n="27" xml:id="d546fn27"><ref

                            exchange of notes might well embody the sense of the decree of December
                            20, 1934, with one modification, namely, that the notification of an
                            appeal from the decision of the customs authorities should exempt the
                            educational or religious institution from paying the duty originally
                            assessed until such time as the appeal should have been reviewed by the
                            highest customs authorities and until notification of the refusal of
                            such appeal should have been notified to the educational or religious
                            institution through appropriate channels.</p>
                        <p>The insertion of such a provision in the interpretative exchange of notes
                            would preserve the principle of non-acquiescence in an unmodified
                            unilateral French decision on the subject, and at the same time save the
                            American institutions involved much time and money in efforts to have
                            returned to them duties paid under protest in the first instance where
                            interpretation of the decree of December 20, 1934, has been harshly or
                            wrongly applied.</p>
                        <p>As M. de Martel has not yet returned to Syria and is not expected before
                            the middle of August, it has been extremely difficult to obtain <pb
                                n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0545"/>any satisfaction from anyone
                            here on these subjects, since the uncertainty as to the future regime of
                            Syria and the Lebanon makes everyone reluctant to take decisions. If I
                            could have the Department’s consent in principle to the procedure
                            outlined in this despatch, I will take the matter up with M. de Martel
                            on his return, as it would seem most desirable to have the matter
                            definitely settled before any new regime can take over in the Lebanon or
                            Syria.</p>

                            philanthropic institutions in Syria and the Lebanon of customs
                            privileges previously assured by agreement between the American and

                            practicable a draft of a proposed exchange of notes in accordance

                            with regard to the provisions to be included in such an agreement. After
                            these discussions have taken place you should consult with the French

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s instruction of September 12, 1936, concerning customs
                            privileges on account of American educational and philanthropic
                            institutions in Syria and the Lebanon, and to report that I have carried
                            out the instructions therein contained to draft, in consultation with
                            the High Commission, a proposed exchange of notes to effect the
                            essential modifications in principle and practice which would establish
                            these privileges in accordance with the American rights. The texts of
                            three notes agreed on are attached,<note n="28" xml:id="d548fn28">None
                                of the enclosures mentioned in this despatch are printed. The draft
                                texts here referred to were identical with the final exchange of
                                notes.</note> typed double space and referred to as A, B and C.</p>
                        <p>Before discussing the matter with the authorities at the High Commission,
                            I have had many conversations with the heads of the interested American
                            institutions, namely, President Bayard Dodge and Treasurer George
                            Stewart of the American University, as well as the Reverend James H.
                            Nicol of the American Mission. Copies of the memoranda of conversations
                            with these gentlemen, as well as a copy of a letter from President
                            Dodge, giving his unqualified approval of the arrangements projected,
                            are enclosed herewith. As a result of these conversations, I decided, in
                            addition to the request for delayed payment on appeals in customs cases,
                            to request the High Commission for a more liberal treatment of the
                            importations for the scholastic institutions, in particular those of
                            university grade, basing such a request on the fact of devaluation, as
                            well as on the fact that institutions of university grade have greater
                            need of importation of expensive material from abroad than institutions
                            of secondary character.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, ever since the receipt of the Department’s instruction on
                            October 5th, I have kept in constant touch with the High Commissioner,
                            Comte Damien de Martel, and the Secretary General of the High
                            Commission, M. Meyrier, on this subject, urging them to consider the
                            matter and settle the points of difference. On different occasions both
                            the High Commissioner and M. Meyrier expressed their willingness to get
                            at the matter as soon as possible, but begged me to defer the subject
                            until French treaties with Syria and the Lebanon should be out of the
                            way. The negotiation of that with the Lebanon was followed by
                            disturbances which further delayed the consideration of this matter, as
                            did also the preparation of the French case to place before the League
                            of Nations in connection with the Turkish reactions in the Sandjak of
                            Alexandretta. However, on December <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482"
                                facs="0547"/>6th, M. de Martel told me that the High Commission was
                            ready to discuss the matter, and empowered M. Kieffer, Head of the
                            Political Bureau, to come to an agreement with me on the subject.</p>
                        <p>On Wednesday morning, December 9th, I saw M. Kieffer at the High
                            Commission by appointment, and a memorandum of our conversation is
                            enclosed. In order to expedite matters, I presented him with the texts
                            in English and an unofficial translation into French of three notes
                            which appeared to me satisfactory in the premises, and we went over them
                            together. M. Kieffer saw no objections in principle, but wished to
                            consult the technicians of the customs regime, which he did, and then
                            sent the head of that service, M. Roux, Inspector General, to see me on
                            December 11th to draw up the exact texts to carry out the suggestions
                            made. I agreed with M. Roux on texts which seemed to fulfill the
                            American demands, and they are set forth in the memorandum of
                            conversation of December 11th hereunto annexed. The last step in the
                            negotiation which could take place in Beirut was completed today when I
                            saw M. Kieffer at the High Commission at 10:30 A.M. to agree on slight
                            modifications on the drafts of notes that I had submitted, called for by
                            the method which the customs regime felt was more satisfactory to give
                            effect to our requests. The substance of our conversation at this time
                            is contained in a memorandum of even date attached hereto. The texts as
                            finally agreed on are annexed as mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>As stated before, the American institutions involved are more than
                            pleased with the modifications suggested, as it will mean an increase of
                            the limits of free importation for the American University of at least
                            9000 Syrian pounds per year, and possibly more, and furthermore will
                            remove burdensome difficulties with respect to appeals on customs cases.
                            If any question should arise in the Department’s mind as to the
                            transmission through the Consulate General of an engagement taken by the
                            President of the University or the heads of other educational, religious
                            and philanthropic institutions, with respect to the eventual payment
                            while customs question is under appeal, I wish to emphasize that the
                            transmission of such an engagement involves no responsibility on the
                            part of the Consulate General; that it would only occur in extremely few
                            cases, for the University only, in view of the limit of 1000 pounds of
                            duty set for the exercise of such a privilege, and that it is destined,
                            from the point of view of the Mandate authorities, to avoid abuses of
                            such a privilege by nationals of the Mandated States who are equally
                            heads of educational, religious and philanthropic institutions (See
                            enclosure No. 12).</p>
                        <p>I am sending one copy of this despatch by air mail to the Department, as
                            well as to Paris, and the French High Commission is doing the same with
                            its texts of the drafts in order that the matter may <pb n="483"
                                xml:id="pg_483" facs="0548"/>be cleared up at an early date, as now
                            that the decision has been arrived at here, the customs authorities are
                            anxious to issue the necessary decree of revision in order to give the
                            institutions involved the benefit of larger importations. M. Kieffer
                            informs me that the moment a telegram is received from Paris that the

                            discussed with Mr. Seyrig, Inspector General of Archaeology, the subject
                            matter enclosed with the Department’s instruction of April 27, 1936
                            (File No. 890D.927/24),<note n="31" xml:id="d550fn31">Not
                                printed.</note> enclosing a copy of an instruction to the American
                            Ambassador in Paris,<note n="32" xml:id="d550fn32"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Supra.</hi></note> with respect to possible restrictions upon
                            archaeological activities in Syria. Mr. Seyrig told me that he was very
                            glad to know that the American Government had manifested its interest in
                            this subject, as he had been informed that the Belgians and British had
                            done likewise. He said that up to the present the Syrian authorities had
                            shown themselves slightly more liberal in archaeological matters than
                            the interested services in the Lebanon, and therefore he hoped that when
                            this portion of the treaty should come under discussion the same
                            liberalism might be continued. He said that this policy was illustrated
                            by the fact that the regulations now in existence in Syria permitted the
                            museum at Damascus to maintain a sales room for the disposition of
                            duplicates, whereas in the Lebanon there was no such possibility and the
                            Beirut museum, which is not even yet ready, will be choked by
                            accumulations of duplicates. Should these items become available for
                            sale they would serve the needs of many museums and universities and
                            bring in a large revenue to the Governments here which might be utilized
                            for further archaeological investigation.</p>

                        <p>Upon receipt of the Department’s instruction of April 27 an officer of
                            the Embassy called upon an official of the Sous-Direction d’Afrique et
                            de Levant at the Foreign Office and left with him an <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> stating, in effect, that eminent American
                            archaeologists had brought to the attention of the Department their
                            anxiety over rumors tending to indicate that certain restrictions might
                            be placed upon archaeological activities in Syria in consequence of the
                            current negotiations in Paris between the Syrian Delegation and the
                            French Government, and that in view of the great interest of American
                            archaeologists in this subject the Embassy had been directed to inquire
                            informally of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs whether in fact the
                            question of archaeological activities in Syria or the revision of the
                            Antiquities Law in Syria were included among the questions to be
                            discussed during these negotiations. At the same time the officer left
                            with the Foreign Office a summary of the pertinent statements set forth
                            in the first enclosure to the Department’s instruction of April 27.</p>
                        <p>The official of the Foreign Office stated that archaeological excavations
                            in Syria were in fact included among the subjects discussed with the
                            Syrian Delegation at present in Paris and that he was very glad to have
                            an expression of interest in the subject from the American Government as
                            he had had similar inquiries from the British and the Belgians and that
                            these exhibitions of interest in the matter by foreign governments would
                            strengthen the hand of the Foreign Office in its negotiations with the
                            Syrian Delegation. He said that the French Government was insisting upon
                            the maintenance of the present regulations for an additional period of
                            twenty years and upon the maintenance of a French citizen in the
                            position of Director of Antiquities.</p>
                        <p>Upon the receipt of the Department’s instruction of July 22 an officer of
                            the Embassy again called at the Foreign Office and was informed that an
                            agreement had not yet been reached upon the question of archaeological
                            activities in Syria, but that the French Government intended to maintain
                            its position of retaining the present regulations without material
                            change.</p>
                        <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0551"/>
                        <p>The official of the Sous-Direction d’Afrique et de Levant expressed
                            considerable impatience with the difficulties which had been encountered
                            in connection with these negotiations which constantly appeared to
                            approach termination but could not be completed because of new and
                            impossible demands on the part of the Syrians. Although he would not go
                            into detail regarding the difficulties being met, he said that the
                            points giving the most trouble were the protection of the minorities and
                            the related subject of stationing French troops in Syria. He was
                            sanguine that these matters would be settled eventually and promised to
                            inform the Embassy when the negotiations had been completed.</p>
                        <p>It appears that upon the completion of the negotiations here the Syrian
                            Delegation must return to Syria and go before the country in general

                        <p>The effect of these decrees is to prohibit the practice of medicine or
                            pharmacy in the Lebanon, after November 1, 1939, and November 1, 1938,
                            respectively, to any person who does not hold the Lebanese, Syrian, or
                            French baccalaureate diploma or the degree of Bachelor of Arts of the
                            American University of Beirut. Corresponding degrees from other
                            countries, even though equivalent or superior to those specifically
                            mentioned, appear to be excluded from recognition.</p>
                        <p>Since it is extremely improbable that any American physician or
                            pharmacist, receiving his training in American institutions, would hold
                            any of the degrees mentioned, such persons would be excluded from the
                            right to practice their profession in the Lebanese Republic.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as it is hardly likely that an American would care to set up an
                            individual practice of medicine or pharmacy in this country, this
                            discrimination is of slight importance so far as the general independent
                            practice of the professions is concerned. However, should the provisions
                            of these decrees be literally applied, the practical effect would be to
                            prevent American religious missions or educational and philanthropic
                            institutions from engaging American physicians to carry on their work.
                            The American University of Beirut, the ranking members of whose medical
                            faculty are always predominantly American or European, would be
                            especially affected.</p>
                        <p>In a note dated December 15, 1933, a copy of which is enclosed, I brought
                            to the attention of the French High Commissioner the situation which
                            might result from a strict application of these decrees, with the
                            request that the steps be taken to ensure that American educational and
                            philanthropic institutions shall not be limited in the choice of
                            physicians whose services are required. I have now received from the
                            High Commission a reply, of which a translation is enclosed, expressing
                            the opinion that no <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> discrimination
                            results from the decrees in question, despite the incontestable fact
                            that the situation thus created does actually leave American physicians
                            in a less favored position than those of Lebanese, Syrian, or French
                            nationality.</p>
                        <p>The High Commission takes the standpoint that the list of degrees
                            specifically acknowledged as equivalent to the Lebanese baccalaureate is
                            not exclusive of all other diplomas, since the President of the Republic
                            may at any time add to this list. Even if this interpretation <pb
                                n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0553"/>be correct, which seems to me
                            doubtful, this statement still appears to evade the issue and to place
                            in the category of a courtesy, to be granted in the discretion of the
                            Lebanese Government, what should be considered as a right guaranteed
                            under the terms of the Mandate to citizens of the United States and of
                            members of the League of Nations.</p>
                        <p>In connection with this matter, I have acted in concert with the British
                            Consul General, who is desirous of safeguarding similar British
                            interests. The reply received by the British Consul General to his note,
                            which approached the question from a slightly different angle, was
                            identical with that addressed to me.</p>
                        <p>As the evasive tenor of the note of the High Commission appears to
                            indicate an unwillingness to take steps to rectify the situation, I have
                            the honor to inquire whether the Department desires me to make further
                            representations, or whether it is preferred that the matter be taken up
                            through the American Embassy in Paris.</p>

                                French High Commissioner, and desires to call attention to the fact
                                that Legislative Decrees Nos. 65 and 66 of the Lebanese Government,
                                dated January 5, 1933, contain provisions which, if literally
                                interpreted, might seriously interfere with the work of certain
                                American philanthropic institutions in the Lebanese Republic.</p>
                            <p>The effect of these decrees is to prohibit the practice of medicine
                                in the Lebanon, after November 1, 1939, to any person who does not
                                hold the Lebanese, Syrian, or French baccalaureate diploma or the
                                degree of Bachelor of Arts of the American University of Beirut.
                                Corresponding degrees from other countries, even though equivalent
                                to those especially mentioned, appear to be specifically excluded
                                from recognition.</p>
                            <p>Under these provisions, any American physician or pharmacist would be
                                excluded from the right to practice his profession in the Lebanese
                                Republic, since it is very improbable that a person receiving his
                                medical training in the United States would hold any of the degrees
                                mentioned.</p>
                            <p>More specifically, the practical effect would be to prevent American
                                religious or educational missions from availing themselves of the
                                services of physicians of any nationality other than Lebanese,
                                Syrian, or <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0554"/>French. For
                                instance, the American University of Beirut, the higher ranking
                                members of whose medical faculty have always been predominantly
                                American and European, would find it impracticable to exercise a
                                free choice in engaging foreign specialists; and several religious
                                missions which conduct hospitals or clinics would similarly be
                                prevented from entrusting the direction of these institutions to
                                American physicians.</p>
                            <p>It is of course realized that the purpose of the decrees in question
                                is the very proper one of raising the educational standards of the
                                medical profession in the Lebanon, and that a discrimination against
                                foreign physicians, or a limitation of the freedom of action of
                                American philanthropic institutions, is not intended. Nevertheless,
                                Mr. Steger would appreciate it if M. de Martel would carefully
                                consider the unfavorable situation which, as outlined above, would
                                result from a strict application of the provisions of these decrees,
                                as well as the possibility of taking measures which will ensure the
                                exemption from these provisions of medical men appointed to the
                                staffs of American philanthropic and educational institutions.</p>

                                liberal professions, require of the latter the possession of the
                                diploma of the Lebanese baccalaureate or of an equivalent
                                diploma.</p>

                            <p>The equivalence of the Syrian baccalaureate requires no
                                discussion.</p>
                            <p>The Lebanese Government has admitted the French baccalaureate in view
                                of the fact that French is an official language in the Lebanon.</p>
                            <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0555"/>
                            <p>It has also admitted the diploma of Bachelor of Arts of the American
                                University on account of the excellent education acquired in this
                                establishment by numerous Lebanese in the past seventy years.</p>
                            <p>While reserving an opinion with regard to the application of Article
                                11 of the Mandate on such matters, I believe these new regulations
                                cannot be criticized on the basis of this article: They do not
                                establish among candidates for the liberal professions any
                                discrimination on the basis of their nationality or of the
                                nationality of the institutions where the latter carried out their
                                studies. This is all which is required by the principle of economic
                                equality. It requires only an equality consisting, as in this case,
                                of the establishment of uniform rules applicable to all. But it is
                                not incompatible with <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> inequalities
                                resulting from the differences produced by the application of
                                uniform regulations to different situations.</p>
                            <p>It is quite incontestable that the principle of equivalence of
                                diplomas is in strict conformity with equality. In its application
                                    <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> inequalities must perforce
                                occur, by virtue of the Act of the Mandate itself. Article 16, by
                                the terms of which “French and Arabic shall be the official
                                languages in Syria and the Lebanon”, authorizes the mandated States
                                to consider that diplomas granted by institutions not giving
                                instruction in one of these languages are not really equivalent to
                                the local diplomas, it being fundamentally impossible for their
                                holders to have a command of local technical terminology—a thing
                                which might present serious difficulties.</p>
                            <p>Aside from the above, it is well to observe that the list of degrees
                                admitted to be equivalent is not exclusive. In a matter where the
                                terms of the Mandate appear to me to grant to the local governments
                                a certain liberty of interpretation, I have no doubt that, should
                                the case arise, the Lebanese Government will show itself disposed to
                                examine in a favorable light the matter of admitting as equivalent
                                certain American diplomas, on condition, of course, that Lebanese
                                diplomas have the benefit of reciprocity.</p>

                                    provisions of Article 1 of Legislative Decrees Nos. 65 and 66
                                    dated January 5, 1933, issued by the Government of the Lebanese
                                    Republic, requiring applicants for admission to practice
                                    medicine and pharmacy to ‘possess the diploma of a Lebanese
                                    baccalaureate or a diploma officially recognized as equivalent,’
                                    are unnecessarily restrictive for the accomplishment of their
                                    legitimate purposes. My Government likewise considers that the
                                    provisions of those Articles, in conjunction with the provisions
                                    of Article 2 of each decree which empower the Lebanese Chief of
                                    State, at the suggestion of the Director of Public Instruction
                                    and Fine Arts, to determine what degrees are ‘equivalent’ to the
                                    Lebanese baccalaureate, place clearly excessive authority in
                                    those officials the exercise of which is not compatible with the
                                    obligations of the Mandatory under Article 11 of the Mandate for
                                    Syria <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0557"/>and the Lebanon

                                    any State Member of the League of Nations as compared with its
                                    own nationals, including societies and associations, or with the

                                <p>“My Government is also of the opinion that Decree No. 1633 of
                                    March 1, 1933, issued by the Government of the Lebanese Republic
                                    and providing that the only foreign degrees recognized as
                                    equivalent to the Lebanese baccalaureate are degrees of French
                                    institutions, is so clearly discriminatory in favor of French
                                    institutions and against all other foreign institutions that no
                                    discussion of the question is deemed necessary.</p>
                                <p>“Under the circumstances my Government cannot consider as
                                    adequate the reply made by the French High Commissioner at
                                    Beirut under date of January 8, 1934, to the note of December
                                    15, 1933, in which the American Consul at Beirut invited
                                    attention to the discriminatory effect upon American nationals
                                    of the above mentioned decrees. Moreover, the suggestion made in
                                    the High Commissioner’s reply that recognition might upon
                                    request be granted to certain American diplomas ‘on condition of
                                    course that Lebanese diplomas have the benefit of reciprocity’
                                    is obviously improper in view of the fact that by the provisions
                                    of Article 2 of the American-French Convention of April 4, 1924,
                                    the United States and its nationals, including societies and
                                    associations, are unconditionally entitled to all rights
                                    accorded members of the League of Nations.</p>
                                <p>“My Government therefore feels confident that the French
                                    Government will effect the modification of Decrees Nos. 65 and
                                    66 of the Government of the Lebanese Republic so as to insure
                                    that baccalaureate degrees of reputable and qualified American
                                    institutions of learning shall not be placed in a less favorable
                                    position than similar institutions in France and that the
                                    recognition of this right shall not be dependent either upon
                                    reciprocal treatment or upon the arbitrary decision of the local

                            Instruction of February 11, 1936 (File No. 890E.1281/7),<note n="39"

                            medicine <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0558"/>and pharmacy in the
                            Lebanese Republic, I have the honor to report that the French High
                            Commissioner to Syria, who is at present on leave of absence in France,
                            received Mr. Marriner, Counselor of Embassy, on Saturday, March 28, by
                            appointment, and among other subjects touched briefly on the situation
                            concerning the legislation in Lebanon regarding the practice of medicine
                            and pharmacy in that republic.</p>
                        <p>M. de Martel said that the difficulties were engendered by the very great
                            number of Syrian graduates of the universities of the region, including
                            the American Presbyterian College at Beirut, who had taken degrees in
                            medicine and pharmacy and were naturally opposed to foreign competition.
                            He said that the tendency of the Syrian peoples to go in for the liberal
                            professions had caused the gravest amount of overcrowding of all of them
                            in the French mandate, with consequent jealousy of either doctors or
                            lawyers coming from the outside. He said, however, that the Government
                            of the Lebanon was studying the question and indicated that in any
                            legislation it was certain that France would receive no other or more
                            favorable treatment than any other nation.</p>
                        <p>To-day, I received a note, signed on behalf of the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs by M. Bargeton, Director of Political and Commercial Affairs,
                            stating that, according to information furnished by the French High
                            Commissioner to Syria, since the reestablishment of the constitutional
                            regime in the Lebanese Republic, Legislative Decrees Nos. 65 and 66 of
                            January 5, 1933, relative to the conditions required of persons desiring
                            to practice medicine or pharmacy in Lebanon, cannot be modified except
                            by a law voted by the Lebanese Parliament. It is likewise stated in this
                            note that the Government of the Lebanon proposes to present to the
                            Chamber there at its next session a draft of a law modifying the texts
                            of 1933.</p>

                            628 of January 13, 1934 from the consul-in-charge, and to despatch No.
                            2657 from the Embassy at Paris dated April 1, 1936 with regard to the
                            Legislation concerning the practice of Medicine and Pharmacy in Lebanon.
                            It will be recalled that after certain talks with M. de Martel, French
                            High Commissioner in Syria, the Foreign Office at Paris confirmed his
                            statement to me that an effort would be made to have the necessary
                            legislation passed at Beirut to correct the situation, and enable <pb
                                n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0560"/>American physicians and
                            pharmacists to practice, and more particularly to teach, without being
                            possessors of locally acquired bachelors degrees.</p>
                        <p>In the course of my first calls on local officials, especially when I saw
                            M. Eddé, President of the Lebanese Republic, the Secretary of State, M.
                            Tabet, and the Delegate of the High Commission to the Lebanese
                            Government, M. Lafond, I stressed the mutual interest we had that
                            nothing should be done to hamper the access of Americans to teach in the
                            University here.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State told me that the necessary amending law had
                            recently passed but had not yet been promulgated. I expressed the hope
                            that this would be done before the summer holidays set in. When I saw M.
                            Lafond on the thirteenth it was still in abeyance, but apparently he
                            obtained the signature of President Eddé that afternoon, and
                            communicated it to me today in accordance with his promise.</p>

                            Syrian delegation, looking toward the termination of the mandatory
                            régime and the entrance of Syria, and possibly the Lebanon, into the
                            League of Nations as independent states, it becomes important to make

                            Government contemplates with respect to consultation with the United
                            States concerning the termination of the Mandate, the disposition of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to your
                            Instruction No. 1440 of August 4, 1936, regarding the negotiations
                            between the French Government and a Syrian delegation looking toward the
                            termination of the mandatory régime and the entrance of Syria, and
                            possibly the Lebanon, into the League of Nations as independent states,
                            and requesting that the matter be brought to the attention of the French
                            Government with pertinent inquiries as to the arrangements contemplated
                            for consultation with the United States regarding the termination of the
                            Mandate, the disposition of the territories in question and the
                            conditions under which these territories would be administered upon the
                            cessation of the mandatory régime.</p>
                        <p>I called on August 19 on M. de Saint Quentin, Chief of the Africa-Levant
                            Section of the Foreign Office, and discussed the matter with him,
                            leaving with him an <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi>, a copy of which
                            is enclosed herewith. M. de Saint Quentin said that the Foreign Office
                            had not yet given any detailed consideration to the matter of
                            consultation with other Powers, that the negotiations going on with the
                            Syrian delegation were for the purpose of drawing up a treaty which
                            would be signed after elections had taken place in Syria and the setting
                            up of a parliamentary government, and it would probably be two or three
                            years before matters would progress so far as to permit of the entrance
                            of Syria, and possibly the Lebanon, into the League of Nations. He said,
                            however, that it was of course in the mind of the French Government <pb
                                n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0564"/>to communicate at the
                            appropriate time the text of the treaty reached with Syria to the League
                            of Nations and also to the United States. He said that, without wishing
                            to express a final view, he supposed that the same procedure would be
                            followed vis-à-vis the United States respecting Syria and the Lebanon as
                            had been followed by Great Britain in the case of Iraq. I took occasion,
                            in this connection, to explain to M. de Saint Quentin the difference in
                            the position of the United States with respect to Iraq and our position
                            with respect to Syria and the Lebanon, as set out in the Department’s
                            Instruction under reference.</p>
                        <p>I have now received a memorandum from the Foreign Office, dated August
                            25, 1936, in reply to the <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> which I
                            left with M. de Saint Quentin; copies in French and an office

                            <p>In view of the current negotiations between the French Government and
                                a Syrian delegation, looking toward the termination of the mandatory
                                régime and the entrance of Syria, and possibly the Lebanon, into the
                                League of Nations as independent states, it becomes important to
                                make provision for the future respecting the rights of the United
                                States and its nationals in those states under the new conditions
                                which will prevail. The Government of the United States, therefore,
                                desires to bring this matter to the attention of the French
                                Government and to inquire what arrangements the French Government
                                contemplates with respect to consultation with the United States
                                concerning the termination of the Mandate, the disposition of the
                                territories of Syria and the Lebanon, and the conditions under which
                                those territories are to be administered upon the cessation of the
                                mandatory régime.</p>
                            <p>In connection with this matter, reference is made to Article 6 of the
                                Convention between the United States and France, signed at Paris on
                                April 4, 1924, regarding the rights of the two Governments and their
                                respective nationals in Syria and the Lebanon, which reads as
                                follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Nothing contained in the present convention shall be

                                        of the mandate as recited above unless such modification
                                        shall have been assented to by the United States.”</p>

                            <p>In an <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> dated the 19th of this
                                month the Embassy of the United States of America, in view of the
                                current negotiations between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and
                                the Syrian Delegation, was good enough to inquire what arrangements
                                the French Government contemplates with respect to consultation with
                                the Government of the United States concerning the termination of
                                the Mandate and the consequences of this termination.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> refers to Article 6
                                of the Franco-American Convention of April 4, 1924.</p>
                            <p>In reply to this <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi>, the Ministry
                                for Foreign Affairs has the honor to inform the Embassy of the
                                United States of America that the informal negotiations at present
                                in course with the Syrian Delegation have as their essential object
                                the preparation of official negotiations which can only be opened
                                after the Syrian elections and the constitution at Damascus of a
                                parliamentary government.</p>
                            <p>At the close of these official negotiations and after the
                                ratification of the agreements which will mark their conclusion, the
                                text of these agreements will be communicated to the League of
                                Nations. The French Government intends, at the same time, to
                                communicate the text thereof to the Government of the United States
                                of America.</p>
                            <p>Without awaiting, however, this communication, the Ministry for
                                Foreign Affairs is already in a position to inform the Embassy of
                                the United States that the Franco-Syrian and Franco-Lebanon treaties
                                will be closely inspired by the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1932 [<hi

                            the opinion that the fact that M. de Martel had received <pb n="502"
                                xml:id="pg_502" facs="0567"/>no instructions from the Quai d’Orsay
                            regarding the Embassy’s <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> of August
                            19, 1936, was probably due to the circumstances that his rôle was
                            primarily that of negotiator with Syria and the Lebanon, the matter of
                            consultation with the Government of the United States concerning the
                            termination of the Mandate, et cetera, being a matter to be dealt with
                            by the Quai d’Orsay itself. Nevertheless, in order to be doubly sure,
                            Mr. Wilson of the Embassy called this morning upon M. de Saint-Quentin
                            and informed him of the substance of Mr. Marriner’s telegram to the
                            effect that M. de Martel had received no instructions on the subject
                            from the Quai d’Orsay and would be glad to have the point of view of the
                            United States Government brought officially to his attention. M. de
                            Saint-Quentin confirmed the view which we held, as expressed
                            hereinabove, namely, that the Foreign Office memorandum of August 25
                            applies to both Syria and the Lebanon. M. de Saint-Quentin said that he
                            did not know why the Embassy’s <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> had
                            not been communicated to M. de Martel for his information, as M. de
                            Martel was in Paris at the time the <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi>
                            was left at the Foreign Office, but he presumed that it was because of
                            the fact that the question of consultation between the French and
                            American Governments regarding the termination of the Mandate, et
                            cetera, was one to be dealt with by the Quai d’Orsay rather than by the
                            High Commissioner in Syria, He said that there was no possibility that
                            our interests could in any way be adversely affected because of M. de
                            Martel’s lack of instructions regarding our position, adding that he
                            would in any case transmit at once copies of the Embassy’s <hi
                                rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> of August 19 and the Foreign Office
                            memorandum of August 25 to M. de Martel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wilson mentioned to M. de Saint-Quentin that a copy of the Foreign
                            Office memorandum of August 25 had been transmitted to the Department of
                            State and that doubtless the Embassy would receive further instructions
                            from the Department regarding this matter.</p>

                            <p>In 1923, when Turkey consented, at Lausanne, to sign the Straits
                                Convention establishing liberty of passage and demilitarization, the
                                    <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0569"/>general situation of
                                Europe, from the political and military points of view, presented an
                                aspect totally different from that which she presents today.</p>
                            <p>Europe was moving towards disarmament and her political organization
                                was to be based solely on the immutable principles of law sanctioned
                                by international engagements. Land, sea and air forces were much
                                less formidable and their tendencies were in the direction of
                                reduction. At that time Turkey signed the respective clauses of the
                                Straits Convention with the assurance given her by Article 18 which
                                had just added, to the guarantee of Article 10 of the Covenant of
                                the League of Nations,<note n="4" xml:id="d564fn4"><hi rend="italic"

                                signatories and, in any case, four great Powers undertook to assume
                                jointly and by all means decided upon for that purpose by the
                                Council of the League, the defense of the Straits when menaced.</p>
                            <p>Since then the situation which existed in the Black Sea has come to
                                present an aspect of concord reassuring in every way, while
                                uncertainty has settled little by little over the Mediterranean,
                                Naval Conferences have shown a development in the direction of
                                rearmament, and maritime shipyards will soon pour into the sea ships
                                of a power never reached before. In the domain of the air, the curve
                                is dizzily rising, and continental and insular fortifications are
                                constantly multiplied.</p>
                            <p>During this complete change of conditions the only guarantee which
                                was to have prevented entire insecurity of the Straits has just
                                disappeared in its turn, and while the most interested Powers
                                proclaim the existence of a threat of a general conflagration,
                                Turkey, at her most vulnerable point, finds herself exposed to the
                                worst dangers without any counterpoise to that disquieting
                                insecurity.</p>
                            <p>In acceding to the pressing requests which were addressed to her,
                                Turkey accepted the demilitarization of the Straits at that time
                                entirely occupied by foreign forces, after having long weighed,
                                under the existing conditions, the value of the minimum guarantees
                                which were granted to her, “in order that the demilitarization of
                                the Straits and of the contiguous zones shall not constitute an
                                unjustifiable danger to the military security of Turkey.”</p>
                            <p>To Article 18 of the Convention which sanctioned the security
                                guarantee indissolubly linked to the ensemble of the clauses
                                governing the régime of the Straits, the signatories attached such
                                great importance that they solemnly affirmed that the guarantee in
                                question formed an integral part of the clauses of demilitarization
                                and of freedom of passage.</p>
                            <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0570"/>
                            <p>This is equivalent to saying that without an effective, practical and
                                efficacious assurance there could not have been imposed on Turkey a
                                diminution of sovereignty over a part of her territory the security
                                of which is indispensable to that of the whole country.</p>
                            <p>It is likewise obvious that if this guarantee becomes inoperative or
                                uncertain the equilibrium of the whole Convention is destroyed to
                                the prejudice of Turkey and to the prejudice of the peace of
                                Europe.</p>
                            <p>Now, the political crises have clearly demonstrated that the present
                                mechanism of collective guarantee goes into motion too slowly and
                                that a tardy decision is of such a character as to cause the loss,
                                in most cases, of the benefit of an international action. It is for
                                this reason that Turkey, like many other countries at the present
                                time, could not, in 1923, content herself with the collective
                                guarantee which the Covenant would have assured to her as soon as
                                she became a member of the League of Nations, that she considered
                                insufficient the collective guarantee of all the signatories of the
                                Straits Convention and that only the joint guarantee of the four
                                great Powers seemed to her capable of assuring, under the conditions
                                then prevailing, the minimum of security indispensable to her
                                territorial integrity.</p>
                            <p>But if that minimum itself is weakened or rendered problematic by
                                political and military circumstances entirely different from those
                                existing when it was established, the Government of the Republic
                                cannot, without rendering itself guilty of grave negligence, expose
                                the whole country to a sudden and irreparable attack (<hi

                            <p>The position of the guarantors of the security of the Straits with

                                render at least doubtful the military and effective collaboration of
                                those guarantors as regards the objective assigned to them, are
                                factors which have overturned the general economy of the 1923
                                Convention.</p>
                            <p>Today it cannot be affirmed that the security of the Straits is still
                                assured by a real guarantee and Turkey cannot be asked to remain
                                indifferent to the possibility of a dangerous default.</p>
                            <p>It should be added to these considerations that the Straits
                                Convention only mentions the states of peace and war, Turkey being a
                                neutral or belligerent in this latter case, without contemplating
                                the possibility of a special or general threat of war and permitting
                                Turkey to then take steps for her legitimate defense. Now, it is
                                fully demonstrated today that the most delicate phase of an external
                                danger is precisely that phase of menace, there being a possibility
                                that a state of war might supervene unexpectedly and without any
                                formality.</p>
                            <p>This lacuna can by itself deprive the guarantees envisaged of their
                                efficacy whatever may be the value of the latter.</p>

                            <p>From the beginning of its existence, the Turkish Republic has marked
                                out for itself a policy of peace and understanding the realization
                                of which in all fields has not failed to impose upon her sacrifices
                                which have often been heavy.</p>
                            <p>The Turkish Government has shown under the many circumstances which
                                have presented themselves during the last decade a spirit of
                                conciliation, of fidelity to its engagements and of sincere
                                attachment to the cause of peace which has been appreciated by all
                                the Powers.</p>
                            <p>The security which Turkey has always assured to others she has a
                                right to claim for herself.</p>
                            <p>Circumstances independent of the will of the signatories of Lausanne
                                have rendered inoperative clauses laid down in complete good faith,
                                and as the stake is the existence of Turkey and the security of all
                                her territory, the Government of the Republic may be led to take
                                before the nation the responsibility incumbent upon it by adopting
                                measures dictated by the imperious necessity of circumstances.</p>
                            <p>Taking into view the circumstances set forth above and believing with
                                good reason that the provisions of Article 18 of the Straits
                                Convention referring to a joint guarantee of the four great Powers
                                have become uncertain and inoperative and that they no longer can in
                                practice protect Turkey against a foreign danger to her territory,
                                the Government of the Republic has the honor to inform the Powers
                                which took part in the negotiations of the Straits Conventions that

                            following comment with which Mr. Shaw accompanied the copy forwarded for
                            my information: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“At 7:30 p.m. the Foreign Office telephoned me to say that as the
                                    Ambassador was away the Minister wished to see me at 8:30. The
                                    Minister greeted me with even more exuberance than usual. He
                                    said that, as I was aware, they always wanted to keep the
                                    friendly American Government informed of their doings and
                                    therefore he was giving me a copy of a note on the Straits
                                    régime which had been approved after an all-night session of the
                                    Council of Ministers and which was being addressed to all the
                                    Governments which had taken part in the negotiation of the
                                    Lausanne Straits Convention. On purpose he said he had chosen a
                                    broad formula since some Powers which had signed the Convention
                                    had not ratified it; e. g., the U. S. S. R. and Yugoslavia. He
                                    said the note would be given out on Monday and the Turkish
                                    Ambassador in Washington had been instructed to inform the
                                    Department concerning the note tomorrow. After I had had an
                                    opportunity of reading the note the Minister asked me what I
                                    thought of it. I expressed satisfaction that Turkey after
                                    setting forth clearly and soberly her view of the case was
                                    prepared to negotiate a new régime rather than create a <hi
                                        rend="italic">fait accompli</hi>. The Minister replied that
                                    Europe had been treated to various ways of handling
                                    international questions, but the present note represented the
                                    Turkish way. He called my attention to the fact that the note
                                    contained no reference to prestige and honor and no
                                    high-sounding phrases. I inquired how he envisaged the
                                    negotiations. He said that some of the Governments addressed
                                    would doubtless say they weren’t particularly interested in the
                                    matter of the Straits and Turkey could do as she wished; others
                                    would have definite ideas and negotiations would be carried on
                                    at Ankara. I asked the Minister whether I was correct in
                                    thinking that Articles 1 and 2 and the Annex to Article 2 of the
                                    Lausanne Straits Convention were not affected by the present
                                    Turkish action and that it was Article 4 that the Turks had
                                    particularly in mind. The Minister at once replied that there
                                    would have to be changes in the Annex to Article 2 with respect
                                    to vessels of war. He was not too clear as to just what these
                                    changes should be. He spoke of the desirability that each case
                                    of a war vessel entering the Black Sea should be considered on
                                    its merits with ample previous notice, not only to Turkey but to
                                    other interested Powers. He spoke of the responsibilities of
                                    Turkey to Europe in this connection. He said Turkey hadn’t the
                                    slightest anxiety about the naval programs of any of the Black
                                    Sea Powers. Under their naval agreement with the Soviets there
                                    was notification of any naval building and the confidence
                                    created by this fact eliminated any apprehension. On commercial
                                    navigation of the Straits the Minister was most emphatic that
                                    Turkey stood squarely not only for the facilities set up under
                                    the Lausanne Convention, but for any extension and liberalizing
                                    of those facilities that could be worked up. He pointed out that
                                    Turkey had always considered the Lausanne Convention as applying
                                    not only to the commercial vessels of the signatory countries,
                                    but to all commercial vessels and that they would not depart
                                    from this view in the future. He said that if he were called
                                    upon for a text of an agreement regarding commercial navigation
                                    of the Straits, he would at once propose the pertinent parts of
                                    the existing Convention. He even went <pb n="508"
                                        xml:id="pg_508" facs="0573"/>so far as to say that they
                                    would have no objection to the continuance of some kind of
                                    international Straits Commission. They welcomed witnesses, he
                                    said. I said I supposed Turkey had no intention of raising any
                                    question over the demilitarized zones set up by Article 1 of the
                                    Thracian Convention.<note n="7" xml:id="d565fn7">League of

                                    present limitations on Bulgaria’s military establishment that
                                    demilitarized zone is unobjectionable from the Turkish point of
                                    view, but should Bulgaria rearm then Turkey will insist on
                                    fortifying Edirne (Adrianople) to restore the balance of
                                    forces.…”</p>

                                    telephoned from Geneva. The Minister told me that Suad Bey

                                    Straits régime. Dr. Aras had given Suad Bey reasons for
                                    believing Mr. Titulesco’s fears were quite groundless.”</p>

                        <p>It will be noted that this communication of the Turkish Government looks
                            to the reconsideration (or, by obvious implication, the abolition) of
                            those provisions of the Lausanne Convention relevant to the
                            demilitarization of the Straits: and that, although the determination to
                            be rid of such military restrictions is plainly enough indicated (in the
                            penultimate paragraph) by the words that this Government “may be brought
                            to take before the nation the responsibility incumbent upon it, by
                            adopting the measures dictated by the imperative necessity of the
                            circumstances,” that threat of eventual unilateral action is
                            nevertheless subordinated to the conciliatory assurance that the Turkish
                            Government “is ready to undertake discussions with a view to arriving,
                            in the near future, at the conclusion of agreements designed to regulate
                            the régime of the Straits under the conditions of security indispensable
                            for the inviolability of Turkish territory, and in the most liberal
                            spirit as regards the continued development of commercial navigation
                            between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.”</p>
                        <p>The Turkish Government would seem to have taken advantage very adroitly
                            of the conjuncture of European affairs consequent upon the German
                            remilitarization of the Rhineland and (incidentally, though not
                            negligibly, from the viewpoint of the Near East) upon the Austrian
                            reestablishment of conscription. Not only is the moment one at which
                            Turkey might expect to find a minimum of effective opposition, because
                            of the preoccupation of the principally interested Powers with far
                            graver “revisionist” threats to their interests and to their actual
                            security; but the course of the discussions that have thus far taken
                            place between Germany and the other Locarno Powers—discussions in which
                            the latter have in effect taken the position that they would consent to

                            only Germany would pay at least symbolic deference to the sanctity of
                            those instruments—would seem to have estopped Great Britain and France
                            and Italy from taking any strong stand against the less vital revision
                            of military restrictions which Turkey now proposes to effect by
                            negotiation and mutual accord. It would thus seem that Turkey is likely
                            not only to achieve her present purpose, but to acquire, in doing so,
                            the <hi rend="italic">kudos</hi> of having set an example of correctness
                            and good-will in her international relationships.</p>
                        <p>There is indeed some question whether this wise moderation of the Turkish
                            Government’s <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> originated with it. From
                            certain conversations which he has had in Ankara, Mr. Shaw has received
                            the impression that, almost until the last moment before despatching the
                            note, the Turkish authorities had intended to exploit in a less
                            conciliatory way the opportunity which the European situation now
                            affords them, but that their intentions were moderated as a result of
                            conversations with the British Ambassador. Although, in a brief talk
                            which I had with him yesterday, Sir Percy Loraine did not actually
                            confirm that impression, he did seem to me to lend color to it by
                            stressing the admirable manner of the Turkish <hi rend="italic"
                                >démarche</hi>, even while stating that he did not yet know what
                            view his Government would be disposed to take towards the substance of
                            the request.</p>
                        <p>The attitude thus expressed by the British Ambassador may perhaps be
                            construed to indicate that his Government has not at any rate reacted
                            strongly against the Turkish demand for revision, and may be expected to
                            acquiesce. And it would seem that France has no such proximate interest
                            as would warrant her taking a definite attitude of opposition. Nor would
                            it appear likely that Japan, although one of the Powers guaranteeing the
                            régime under Article 18 of the Straits Convention, would feel disposed
                            to concern herself actively in so remote a question, any more than in
                            the analogous case of her participation in guaranteeing the status of
                            the Memel Territory; both cases are perhaps mere survivals of an
                            international orientation of Japanese policy, which has since been
                            discarded in favor of a policy centred almost wholly upon Asia. Italy
                            would seem to be the only one of the guaranteeing Powers which might
                            prove disposed, on account of her considerable mercantile interests, and
                            possibly for reasons related to her present tendencies towards a form of
                            imperialism, to oppose substantial objections and difficulties in the
                            way of Turkey’s obtaining the desired revision of the Convention.</p>
                        <p>But even although the guarantors and other Powers signatory to the
                            Convention may prove disposed to acquiesce in the revision which Turkey
                            demands, it may well be that Great Britain and France, at any <pb
                                n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0575"/>rate, would find it
                            embarrassing to deal with the question of Turkey’s remilitarization of
                            the Straits until at least there shall have been worked out some
                            tolerable solution of the question of Germany’s remilitarization of the
                            Rhineland. It is therefore possible that Turkey’s <hi rend="italic"
                                >démarche</hi> may remain for the present in abeyance, save perhaps
                            for some preliminary informal assurances, until definite progress may
                            have been achieved in the settlement of the crisis in Western European
                            affairs.</p>

                            Although the representatives of the most interested powers here express
                            opinions, the position of their states does not seem as yet in any way
                            crystallized. The Secretariat view is that the Turkish notification is a
                            salutary influence in international affairs in contrast to the recent
                            series of unilateral denunciation of treaties and the hope is
                            particularly expressed that it may presage action under article 19 of
                            the Covenant which would bring the League usefully into play and
                            increase its prestige. Among the representatives of the most interested
                            powers, I find currents of view countenancing national political
                            interests such as the favorable attitude toward the Turkish position on
                            the part of the Balkan Entente running counter in the same field to
                            their basic policy of anti-revisionism.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that in an
                            informal conversation to-day, the Foreign Office confirmed that it had
                            sent a sympathetic reply to the Turkish proposal for Treaty revision
                            with a view to refortifying the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, and made
                            the following observations in this general relation.</p>
                        <p>While the Foreign Office would have preferred that Turkey had addressed
                            its communication to the Secretary General of the League and had the
                            Assembly take the steps provided for in Article 19 of the Covenant,
                            instead of addressing the signatories of the Lausanne Treaty direct and
                            merely informing the League, it was realized that the former procedure
                            would have afforded the representatives of the anti-revisionist
                            countries in the Assembly an excellent opportunity to block Turkey’s
                            aspirations. Nevertheless the Foreign Office welcomed the
                            straightforward nature of Turkey’s proposal, which they considered quite
                            proper. The Foreign Office thought that the Turkish Government had shown
                            good judgment in its choice of the moment to request a revision of the
                            Régime of the Straits and that Turkey was in the present instance
                            probably actuated more by fear of Italian expansion in the Mediterranean
                            than for any other reason.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office said that, while they had no doubt the Italian
                            Government would desire to oppose the refortification of the Straits,
                            they would be interested to see what sort of a case Italy, a revisionist
                            country and an outstanding treaty-breaker, could make against Turkey.
                            Referring briefly to the other interested Powers, the Foreign Office
                            said there would not be much opposition, except, perhaps, in the case of
                            the French, “who object to everything.” Greece also feared Italy and
                            wished to fortify her own islands; Rumania, as a member of the Balkan
                            Entente, seemed favorably disposed; Bulgaria was agreeable for
                            revisionist and other reasons; and Soviet Russia, a signatory who had
                            not ratified the Treaty, was an ally of Turkey and for this and other
                            obvious reasons, had assumed a very favorable attitude.</p>
                        <p>As regards the problem from a purely military standpoint, the Foreign
                            Office felt that Turkey could block the Straits in a few hours even
                            under the existing Régime. By the same token, owing to the great
                            advances in the air, the blocking of the Straits alone no longer
                            afforded adequate protection to Constantinople. The question of
                            permitting Turkey to refortify the Straits was therefore becoming
                            largely academic.</p>

                        <p>This question of altering the Régime of the Straits was discussed with
                            the same official of the Foreign Office a little less than two years ago
                            and reported in the Embassy’s despatch No. 824, of July 13, 1934.<note

                            the Turks had agreed to drop the question and felt that the less said
                            about it the better. In to-day’s conversation reported above, the same
                            official seemed most heartily to welcome the present proposal of the
                            Turkish Government. The Embassy could not help being struck by this
                            change of attitude even though it is easy enough to understand in view
                            of the highly important changes which have occurred since the first
                            conversation took place: especially Germany’s re-occupation of the
                            Rhineland, Italy’s successes in Ethiopia and the severe loss which
                            British prestige has suffered, particularly in the Mediterranean
                            area.</p>

                                Ambassador,<note n="17" xml:id="d570fn17">Sir Percy Loraine.</note>
                            touching on various aspects of the same question.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States has, as I understand the matter, no
                            treaty right, direct or indirect, with respect to the Straits
                            Convention; nor has it any concern with the military and political
                            aspects of that Convention; its sole practical interest in the matter is
                            the maintenance (or perhaps the amelioration) of the régime of freedom
                            of commercial navigation through the Straits. There is every reason to
                            believe that it is the intention of the Turkish Government to maintain
                            that régime satisfactorily and without discrimination for the benefit of
                            maritime traffic, even in the event of the termination of Turkey’s
                            present conventional obligations in that regard. And in view
                            particularly of the disposition of the Turkish Government, because of
                            the “favorable balance of trade” with the United States, to give
                            American commerce the most favorable treatment, I am confident that we
                            need feel no anxiety about the continued enjoyment by our shipping of
                            the benefits of the régime.</p>
                        <p>There are, indeed, certain minor points in which improvements might be
                            suggested. On the basis of its contacts with the American Export Line
                            (the sole American shipping company affected) the Consulate-General
                            informs me that this line, in common with the British and other shipping
                            interests concerned, considers that the quarantine charge of four
                            piastres (say $0,032) per net registered ton on vessels navigating these
                            waters in either direction (and even when not stopping in transit), and
                            the same charge for the maintenance of life-saving service, levied upon
                            each voyage into the Black Sea, are unduly high and, in the case of
                            vessels merely passing through the Straits, unwarranted. Although it
                            does not appear that, even under the existing Convention, there is any
                            basis for demanding as of right that these charges be abated, there may
                            possibly develop, in connection with the proposed reconsideration of the
                            Convention, some favorable opportunity to suggest to the Turkish
                            Government the reduction of these charges. The Embassy would of course
                            take advantage of any such occasion, either acting alone or cooperating
                            with the representatives of other maritime nations.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as our interest in the question of the Straits is confined to
                            matters in which we can in any case expect the most favorable treatment
                            of our shipping, I venture to suggest that no useful purpose would be
                            served by our being represented by observers in any conference which may
                            be held for the reconsideration of the Convention. On the contrary, in
                            view of the fact that the Turks are even yet manifestly somewhat
                            sensitive about the fact that “as a matter of historical <pb n="514"
                                xml:id="pg_514" facs="0579"/>survival” (to quote Dr. Aras) the
                            régime of commercial navigation in these Turkish waters has been treated
                            as a question for regulation by international agreement rather than by
                            domestic action, I am sure they would feel it to be the more friendly
                            and gracious on our part, and would predispose them to entertain the
                            more sympathetically any ameliorative suggestions which we might find
                            occasion to offer, if we were to refrain from any assertion of interest
                            in the Convention such as would be implied in our sending observers to
                            the prospective conference on the subject. I have accordingly to request
                            that, if the Department shares this view, I may be authorized to let the
                            Turkish authorities know, in whatever manner may seem most appropriate,
                            that our Government, while fully appreciative of the importance of the
                            question of the Straits and interested in keeping informed as to the
                            progress of the negotiations, particularly as they affect the commercial
                            navigation of the Straits, has no intention of participating in that
                            conference.</p>

                            <p>Not having previously had the opportunity of meeting Dr. Aras, I
                                called on him at his house, by appointment, at 4:00 o’clock this
                                afternoon.</p>
                            <p>The conversation shortly turned to the present troubled state of
                                Europe; and in response to a question, he avowed himself optimist
                                enough to believe that war is not actually imminent, but pessimist
                                enough to feel sure that the present <hi rend="italic">gâchis</hi>
                                will go on indefinitely—that things are likely to get worse before
                                they get better—and that, meanwhile, none of the problems now vexing
                                Europe will be solved. I asked whether an exception might not be
                                expected in the case of Turkey’s <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi>
                                with regard to the problem of the Straits. He assented with obvious
                                satisfaction; and he then proceeded to observe that, whereas most of
                                Europe is troubled and alarmed, the situation is quite different in
                                two of its extremities, the Scandinavian and the Balkan areas, which
                                have relatively no international problems or apprehensions, and no
                                external entanglements or commitments other than those derived from
                                the League Covenant. For his own part (and throughout the
                                conversation he used the first-person pronoun in referring to the
                                activities or the views of the Turkish Government) he had for
                                fifteen years done his utmost to bring about appeasement <pb n="515"
                                    xml:id="pg_515" facs="0580"/>and understanding among the Balkan
                                countries, and could now affirm that there are no appreciable
                                difficulties among them.</p>
                            <p>Reverting then to the particular question of the Straits, he said
                                that although he had not yet received formal replies from all the
                                Governments concerned, he nevertheless had reason to believe that
                                within a few days all the interested Powers would have given
                                favorable responses: as for the guaranteeing Powers, Great Britain
                                had already consented to negotiate in the sense requested; France
                                would probably do so shortly; Italy might be expected to make only
                                the same reservation that she has hitherto made as to entering into
                                agreements with countries applying sanctions against her; and he
                                anticipated that Japan would only stipulate that the negotiations
                                must take place outside the League of Nations. Of the nations of the
                                Balkan Entente, Yugoslavia and Greece had already indicated a
                                favorable disposition—Greece the more readily, of course, because
                                two of her islands would by the same act be freed from the present
                                restrictions upon their fortification. Upon my inquiring as to
                                Bulgaria, he first remarked that she had no reason to object, and
                                that she had been the beneficiary of a very friendly and helpful
                                policy on the part of Turkey; and that if Bulgaria were to take an
                                unsympathetic attitude, there was no reason why he should continue
                                to befriend her. Having made these comments with some appearance of
                                asperity, he went on to say that Bulgaria had in fact indicated that

                            <p>As to the procedure by which effect would be given to Turkey’s
                                request for a revision of the Straits Convention, Dr. Aras did not
                                seem yet to be clear. He said that he would discuss the matter with
                                the representatives of the interested Powers on the occasion of the
                                meeting of the League Council in May. He added, in that connection,
                                that he would of course keep Mr. Hugh Wilson<note n="18"
                                    xml:id="d570fn18">Minister to Switzerland.</note> informed of
                                the progress of such discussions, as well as any Japanese official
                                in Geneva whom the Japanese Ambassador may designate to him for that
                                purpose. He contemplated that the interested Governments would wish
                                to consider the question of the Straits at a conference called for
                                the purpose. He trusted that there would be no demand to have the
                                question considered by the League, both because it is not properly a
                                League question, and because such treatment of it would raise an
                                unnecessary difficulty as regards Japan. There was something to be
                                said, however, for holding the conference at Geneva, outside the
                                League, but with the advantage of the facilities the League affords.
                                On the other hand, the Turkish Government would be very glad to have
                                the conference meet on its own territory—either at Ankara or at
                                Istanbul.</p>
                            <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0581"/>
                            <p>He said it was not yet evident just what form the revision of the
                                Straits Convention should take; there would doubtless be a
                                multilateral convention, but it might also prove necessary to
                                conclude one or more bilateral conventions dealing with the
                                particular interests of, say, the Black Sea States, and specially of
                                Russia (which has never ratified the Straits Convention).</p>
                            <p>In its substantive aspect, the revision would deal with three general
                                subjects—1) the commercial navigation of the Straits, 2) the
                                remilitarization of the zone, and 3) the passage of naval vessels.
                                The first two of these subjects could be disposed of in half an
                                hour, as they present no issue at all.</p>
                            <p>As to the first, Turkey is ready to agree out-of-hand to continue the
                                present régime of free commercial navigation, and to consider any
                                improvements which may be suggested in that regime, for the
                                impartial benefit of all nations, whether or not they are
                                signatories of the Convention (and he added that the fact of certain
                                nations being signatory to provisions of that sort was a mere
                                historical survival, and that the only differentiation between
                                signatories and non-signatories would prove to be that the former
                                would now be put to the necessity of negotiating on the subject).
                                Turkey was prepared to assume the appropriate obligations as a
                                matter of voluntary declaration. I understood him to imply (although
                                I missed the opportunity to get him to clear up the point) that he
                                contemplates Turkey’s substituting such a unilateral declaration for
                                the existing multilateral provisions of the Convention.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the remilitarization of the Straits, he said that the
                                indications already received warranted the assumption that the
                                interested Powers are prepared to recognize the abolition of the
                                demilitarized zone.</p>
                            <p>The sole subject as to which the negotiations may be expected to
                                involve any difficulties is that of the terms on which naval vessels
                                and aircraft (other than Turkish) shall be allowed to pass through
                                the Straits. Great Britain and Italy may be expected to insist upon
                                a minimum of restriction, and Russia upon a maximum, on the
                                movements of naval vessels or airships. Between these two extremes
                                of political viewpoint, Turkey considers that it should be possible
                                to find a technically sound system of controlling the transit of
                                such craft through the Straits so as to obviate dangers and
                                surprises, either to Turkey herself or to other Powers in the Black
                                Sea or in the Mediterranean. For the protection of Turkey, it might
                                perhaps be provided that such craft would be allowed to pass through
                                only one by one: and to avoid possible surprises to others, there
                                might be provision for <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0582"
                                />advance notification to the Turkish Government, which would
                                thereupon publish or notify the fact to all other Governments
                                concerned. He remarked, however, that these were merely suggestions
                                which might be considered in the course of efforts to find a system
                                of control satisfactory to all the nations affected.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Aras took occasion to say, early in the course of his comments on
                                the revision of the Convention, and to elaborate at a later point in
                                the conversation, that if there were to be any great delay in
                                effecting the revision as regards the demilitarized zone along the
                                Straits, Turkey would request the approval of the signatory Powers
                                for her taking necessary provisional measures, subject to eventual
                                agreement on a permanent basis. He pointed out that there is at
                                least a theoretical danger of Turkey’s becoming involved in
                                hostilities: for one thing, she is among the countries applying the
                                League sanctions which Italy regards as an abnormality in
                                international relations, and resents as unfriendly; and another
                                aspect of the same fundamental situation is that Italy’s especial
                                animosity towards Great Britain might lead to war between Italy and
                                Germany on the one side, and England, France, and Russia on the
                                other—a situation in which either group, while having no intrinsic
                                quarrel with Turkey, might feel impelled for military reasons to
                                attempt control of the Straits. While hoping and even believing that
                                such contingencies were merely hypothetical, Turkey could not ignore
                                possibilities so vitally endangering her security, and would feel
                                justified, even under the terms of the existing Convention, in
                                taking necessary measures of precaution; but she preferred to act
                                with the acquiescence of the other signatories rather than to
                                proceed solely upon her own construction of her obligations. He
                                further gave me to understand that he had no reason to apprehend
                                that the negotiations for revision would be protracted, save for the
                                possibility that the procedural requirements might take some time in
                                the case of Great Britain (primarily because of the necessity of
                                consulting the Dominions) and possibly of France and Italy.</p>
                            <p>The impressions I derived from the rather discursive comments made by
                                Dr. Aras may be roughly summarized as follows:—</p>
                            <p>Turkey is reasonably confident that through negotiations with the
                                Powers party to the Straits Convention she can arrive at a complete
                                abrogation of that instrument, and has somewhat vaguely in mind

                                        with those set up by the Convention, although perhaps taking
                                        account of ameliorative suggestions from the maritime

                            between Moscow and Turkey are not now so intimate as they have been.
                            There is a feeling that increasing antagonism between England and Italy
                            will lead England to seek close friendship with Turkey, and that Turkey
                            will become less dependent on the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Russian-Turkish friendship has been a <hi rend="italic">mariage de
                                convenance</hi> and there is no reason to suppose that it will long

                            that Japan will make reservations in view of the fact that any change in

                            announcing to the powers signatory to the Treaty of Lausanne a desire
                            for revision of its military clauses, reports began to be received in
                            Turkey that Rumania would raise objections. In fact, during the course
                            of the conversation between the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs and
                            Mr. Shaw, Counselor of this Embassy, on the evening of April 10th (see
                            Despatch No. 20 of April 14, 1936) the former was called to the
                            telephone and was informed by the Turkish representative in Geneva that
                            M. Titulesco was fearful of the effect upon Hungary and Bulgaria of the
                            Turkish action with regard to the Straits Convention. On April 20th the
                            Berlin radio station broadcast a report that a difference of opinion had
                            arisen between Rumania and Greece on the question of the Straits.
                            According to this report, Greece did not wish to oppose the Turkish
                            project, while Rumania was trying to persuade her to do so and to
                            advocate the maintenance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>. The
                            Secretary General of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, M. Numan
                            Menemendjioglu, who had planned a trip to Moscow, changed his itinerary
                            at the last minute and went by way of Belgrade and Bucharest. It is
                            understood that this was for the purpose of bringing about agreement to
                            Turkey’s proposals on the part of all the members of the Balkan Union
                            and especially of Rumania. His efforts were apparently successful; and
                            Rumania, before the meeting of the Balkan Union in Belgrade, expressed,
                            in the form of the enclosed note, her willingness to discuss with
                            sympathy the revision of the Straits Convention.</p>

                        <p>228. I learn from a Minister of a participating state that the present
                            arrangement respecting the Conference on the Regime of the Straits is
                            that it will convene as originally scheduled at Montreux on June 22nd
                            and after setting up committees will adjourn a few days later until
                            after the Assembly, the real decisions not to be taken until the second
                            group of meetings. This is the appearance of a compromise, the Turks
                            desiring the Conference before the Assembly and the British not wishing
                            to participate in any decisions until they could know the Assembly
                            results and also desiring to employ the Council and Assembly sessions as
                            a bargaining ground for action respecting the Straits.</p>
                        <p>There are no evidences here of any particular French policy and the
                            assumption is that France will follow Great Britain’s lead.</p>
                        <p>Consonant with the statement of the Italian representative, reported in

                        <p>30. After giving full consideration to the questions raised in your
                            despatch No. 22 of April 23, the Navy Department reaffirms its view with
                            respect to the desirability of a bilateral agreement between the United
                            States and Turkey for the purpose of safeguarding American rights in the
                            navigation of the Straits, as expressed in its letter of <pb n="522"
                                xml:id="pg_522" facs="0587"/>August 17, 1935, a copy of which was

                        <p>This Department and the Navy Department concur in your view regarding the

                            Accordingly you may in your discretion advise the Turkish authorities
                            informally that this Government has no intention of sending an observer
                            to the Conference but that it would appreciate being kept informed of
                            the progress of negotiations.</p>

                        <p>244. Conference on Regime of the Straits. The Polish Minister returning
                            from a private conversation with the Turkish Foreign Minister at
                            Montreux tells me that Aras informed him that Turkey had given direct
                            commercial assurances to the United States and Poland, the inference
                            being that these were the only non-conference powers to which they had
                            been accorded.</p>
                        <p>The draft convention submitted by Turkey<note n="26" xml:id="d578fn26"
                                    ><hi rend="italic">Actes de la Conference de Montreux</hi>, pp.
                                285–287.</note> makes no mention of a continuing Straits commission.
                            The Bulgarian and Rumanian delegations here expressed to me strongly the
                            view that Turkish governmental formalities at the Straits could in
                            effect be so obstructive and discriminatory as largely to nullify the
                            principle of free commercial transit and that some neutral body of
                            appeal such as a Straits commission is an essential safeguard.</p>
                        <p>I am reliably informed by delegates of various participating states that
                            the present situation at Montreux indicates that there will be no
                            opposition to Turkish remilitarization, that the commercial aspects as
                            suggested above are regarded as a problem, but that the real question in
                            the Conference will be concerning the passage of war vessels each state
                            represented already taking positions based on individual strategic
                            considerations. In the last respect the real problem of the Conference
                            is seen to lie in an adjustment of the British and Russian
                            positions.</p>

                        <p>32. The following statement is made in telegram from Consulate at Geneva
                            dated June 23, noon, reporting on Montreux Conference “The Polish
                            Minister returning from a private conversation with the Turkish Foreign
                            Minister at Montreux tells me that Aras informed him that Turkey had
                            given direct commercial assurances to the United States and Poland, the

                            his statement to you on April 22 covered in the second paragraph on page

                        <p>26. Department’s 32, June 25, 6 p.m. In view of delay in consulting
                            Ambassador I submit following personal opinion: Statements made by
                            Foreign Minister to the Ambassador on April 22 and to me on April 10,
                            see bottom of page Embassy’s despatch No. 20 April [14] are official
                            declarations of Turkish Government’s policy with respect to commercial
                            navigation of the Straits and were deliberately given as such. That
                            navigation is to be at least as free as under Lausanne convention and
                            vessels of all countries whether or not signatory to new convention will
                            benefit without any discrimination whatsoever. Text of convention
                            proposed by Turks at Montreux bears out this view. Statements concerning
                            commercial navigation essentially the same as those made to us were also
                            made by Dr. Aras and Foreign Office officials to several other
                            representatives of non-conference powers. From the outset the Turks have
                            spared no efforts to make their position on this point perfectly clear
                            to everybody.</p>

                        <p>254. Consulate’s 244, June 23, noon, Conference on Regime of the Straits.
                            I learned from delegations here of participating powers that the
                            following are the essentials of the positions of the governments, either
                            expressed or unexpressed, up to the present stage of the Conference.</p>
                        <p>Commercial Questions:</p>
                        <p>Great Britain, Bulgaria and Rumania—The safeguarding of commercial
                            shipping interests by some form of international control or
                            regulations.</p>
                        <p>Remilitarization and transit of warships:</p>
                        <p>Russia—Free ingress and egress for Black Sea powers; opposes equality of
                            rights in this for other powers. Black Sea closed to other powers except
                            for courtesy visits of small units unless in implementation of League or
                            regional pact decisions. Except as last stated no non-riparian
                            belligerent power could enter Black Sea during war.</p>
                        <p>Bulgaria and Rumania—Opposed to provisions described in the last sentence
                            of foregoing but generally favorable to mutual assistance
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>France—Broadly speaking, policy not yet disclosed except its support of
                            mutual assistance features of Russian position.</p>
                        <p>Italy—The Italian representative here made a “personal but official”
                            visit to Montreaux and exposed his Government’s position as a general
                            reservation on all questions concerning remilitarization and transit of
                            warships. His somewhat cryptic thesis on remilitarization was that
                            Turkey should be permitted to remilitarize but not to fortify the
                            Straits. He also indicated opposition to any discrimination in warship
                            transit favoring Black Sea powers.</p>
                        <p>Turkey—To prohibit the passage of warships through the Straits in
                            sufficient strength at any one time to threaten Stamboul. With the
                            foregoing exception riparian states to have unrestricted passage. Other
                            states only for courtesy visits. Generally concentrating on right to
                            fortify. Envisaging failure of ratification of general convention,
                            desires to be accorded right to fortify immediately upon signature or
                            under terms of special separate protocol, also to be accorded in the
                            same manner the privilege of closing the Straits to non-riparian
                            warships in case of a threat of war.</p>
                        <p>Japan—If riparian warships are permitted egress from the Black <pb
                                n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0590"/>Sea non-riparian warships
                            should have ingress on equal terms. Opposes any reference to League in
                            the convention and declines to give any commitments to act in defense of
                            the Straits.</p>
                        <p>Great Britain—In general support of Japan on first item of Japanese

                            disclosing its hand.</p>
                        <p>The best informed general estimate here is that Great Britain is awaiting
                            Italy’s entering the Conference when Great Britain, Japan and Italy will
                            concert their tactics to achieve a bottling up of Russia in the Black
                            Sea. In that feature, however, which presents itself as an
                            Italian-Balkan issue, it is not known to what extent Great Britain may
                            support Italy or maneuver for a middle position.</p>

                        <p>265. Regime of the Straits.</p>
                        <p>1. A member of the British delegation to the Montreux Conference informs
                            me that the British position vis-à-vis Russia, described in the final
                            paragraph of my No. 254, June 26, 5 p.m., had in fact been held by the
                            delegation in the opening days of the Conference but that the present
                            British policy make [<hi rend="italic">marks?</hi>] a definite turning
                            toward an acceptance of the Turkish demands and also of the Russian,
                            with some “escalator” proviso in respect of the latter to the effect
                            that an increase beyond a certain point in the Russian Black Sea fleet
                            would permit a proportionately larger ingress of naval units of
                            non-Black Sea powers. He added that satisfactory conversations had been
                            had with Litvinov and Aras along these lines.</p>
                        <p>He saw, however, a lack of fixity in any British policy in part, at
                            least, due to possible attitudes which might be assumed by Italy and
                            Japan. The Japanese appear to be holding stiffly to their stand as
                            described in my telegram under reference, and there is furthermore, a
                            general feeling in the British delegation that the attitudes of Japan or
                            Italy, or both, might break up the Conference.</p>
                        <p>2. The Greek Minister informs me that the Balkan Entente is unitedly in
                            support of Turkey; but that he has the impression that unless London
                            makes some approach to Rome respecting a general Mediterranean
                            settlement, Italy will not go to Montreux.</p>

                            to enclose herewith a memorandum of a conversation which I had on July
                            25th with Dr. (Tevfik Ruştu) Aras, Turkish Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</p>
                        <p>What seems to me to appear most significantly from this conversation is
                            that, despite the impatience and irritation against Great Britain which
                            the Turkish controlled press was permitted to propagate during the
                            Conference at Montreux, the present intention of this Government is to
                            manifest an attitude of complete satisfaction, and indeed of solidarity,
                            with that of Great Britain. It is not yet fully apparent whether this is
                            due to the favorable results finally attained at Montreux, or to what
                            extent it may be induced by a feeling of common cause with Great Britain
                            with relation to the apprehended pretensions of Italy in the Eastern
                            Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>With respect to certain phases of the latter question, I am reporting by
                            separate despatch certain comments of Dr. Aras, made in the course <pb
                                n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0592"/>of the same conversation,
                            concerning the status of the understanding between Turkey and Great

                            of the League Covenant.</p>

                            <p>Having asked for an appointment in order to present my felicitations
                                to Dr. Aras, who had returned from Montreux on the 24th, I was one
                                of a number of Chiefs of Mission whose visits he received on the
                                afternoon of the 25th, at the Pera Palace Hotel. He was in a very
                                triumphant mood, and scarcely allowed me to speak my word of
                                congratulations before bursting forth into jubilations that Turkey
                                had got from the Conference every substantial thing that she had
                                wanted—which satisfactory result had been achieved in spite of very
                                serious difficulties.</p>
                            <p>Quite in contrast with the attitude of the controlled Turkish press,
                                which during most of the Conference had been protesting against the
                                obstructiveness of the British, he emphasized that this happy
                                outcome was in large degree due to the constant friendly support of
                                the British Delegation. He was so insistent on this point as even to
                                convey the impression that there might well have been a rift which
                                he was now zealously trying to repair.</p>
                            <p>Without specifically blaming either France or Russia, he enlarged
                                upon the difficult situation created for Turkey by their insistence
                                upon keeping the Straits open for the uses of the Franco-Soviet
                                combination while closing them to the naval forces of other Powers.
                                Turkey, he said, could never have accepted such a situation, in
                                which she would have been compelled to compromise her neutrality as
                                guardian of the Straits. Happily, a way out of the impasse had been
                                found by the formula that Turkey should allow the passage of naval
                                forces acting either under mandate of the League or under the terms
                                of a mutual assistance treaty to which Turkey herself might be a
                                party. The latter alternative was altogether out of the question, as
                                Turkey has no present or imaginable intention to become a party to
                                such a treaty; so the proviso was based upon a condition contrary to
                                fact and therefore meaningless save as it was acceptable to the
                                French and Soviet Governments because enabling them to make it
                                appear to their home constituencies that the Conference had given
                                them some additional element of security.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Aras further spoke rather bitterly of the Italian abstention from
                                the Conference, saying that Italy not only had responded in <pb
                                    n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0593"/>terms favorable in
                                principle to considering the revision of the Lausanne Convention but
                                had also accepted the invitation to participate in the Conference on
                                a given date at Montreux, but had later reconsidered that
                                acceptance. He protested he was broad-minded enough to consider that
                                there might be sufficient reasons for Italy’s abstention to explain
                                it as not actually unfriendly to Turkey, but he could not bring
                                himself to regard it as a friendly thing to do.</p>
                            <p>At various points in the course of his rather discursive comments,
                                Dr. Aras reiterated that the new Convention fully and impartially
                                preserves the free commercial navigation of the Straits, and indeed
                                further facilitates it by a slight alleviation of the existing
                                charges for certain services to navigation.</p>

                            to enclose herewith a copy of a note received from the Ministry for
                            Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey on November 12, 1936, together
                            with an English translation thereof.<note n="29" xml:id="d586fn31">Not

                        <p>The note informs the diplomatic missions accredited to Ankara that, the
                            proper number of instruments of ratification of the Powers signatory to
                            the Montreux Convention having been deposited in the archives of the
                            Government of the Republic of France, the provisions of the Montreux
                            Convention became definitively effective on November 9, 1936.</p>
                        <p>The note was delivered to the Embassy during the morning of November 12.
                            That afternoon I had an appointment with Dr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras, Turkish
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs. Early in the course of general
                            conversation, I took occasion to congratulate the Minister on the
                            definitive coming into force of the Montreux Convention, as notified in
                            the Ministry’s circular note of November 11; and I inquired whether, as
                            reported in the press, it was the intention of the Turkish Government to
                            make official publication of the documents. He said that such a
                            publication was in course of preparation, and that he would gladly send
                            me a copy. In thanking him, I remarked that if he should see fit to
                            communicate it to me under cover <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0594"
                            />of a note, his doing so would forestall and set at rest any question
                            that might arise as to the intentions of the Turkish Government
                            concerning our participation in the benefits of the Convention. He at
                            once volunteered to make such a formal signed communication,<note n="30"

                                <p>In his reply of February 10, 1937, the Ambassador stated: “I have
                                    had much satisfaction in transmitting Your Excellency’s letter
                                    and its accompaniments to my Government, pointing out to it
                                    particularly that in your discourse [July 31, 1936] presenting
                                    the Montreux Convention to the Grand National Assembly for
                                    ratification, Your Excellency had stressed the fact that the
                                    benefits of that Convention accrue alike to the signatories and
                                    to non-signatory states, without distinction.”
                                    (767.68119/994)</p></note> by way of further assurance such as
                            he had already given me orally (see memorandum of conversation with him,
                            July 25, transmitted to the Department in Embassy’s No. 90, July 29);
                            and he went on to say that he had already gone further than merely
                            giving individual assurances to us and to other nations not signatory to
                            the Convention—he had, in reporting it to the Grand National Assembly
                            and asking ratification in behalf of the Turkish Government, explained
                            that it embodies a recognition of the principle of free commercial
                            navigation of the Straits and that such recognition is therefore
                            implicit in the Turkish ratification.</p>
