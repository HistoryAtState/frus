                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the U.S. Government. The Historian of the
                    Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of
                    the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of the General
                    Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of <gloss
                        target="#t_PL_1">P.L</gloss>. 102–138 added a new Title <gloss
                        target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities
                    Act of 1956 (22 <gloss target="#t_USC_1">U.S.C</gloss>. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions
                    and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. The statute also
                    confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of
                    historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions
                    made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume meets all regulatory,
                    statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                        en<pb n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>gaged in foreign policy
                    formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State
                    historians by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign
                    policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. Most
                    of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have been
                    declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (Archives II) in College Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s central files for
                    1977–1981 are available in electronic or microfilm formats at Archives II, and
                    may be accessed using the Access to Archival Databases (AAD) tool. Almost all of
                    the Department’s decentralized office files covering this period, which the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred to
                    or are in the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName> Presidential Library and other
                    agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has been declassified,
                    some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The staff of the Carter
                    Library is processing and declassifying many of the documents used in this
                    volume, but they may not be available in their entirety at the time of
                    publication. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Carter Library
                    include some of the most significant foreign-affairs related documentation from
                    White House offices, the Department of State, and other federal agencies
                    including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the
                    Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>Some of the research for volumes in this subseries was done in Carter Library
                    record collections scanned for the Remote Archive Capture (RAC) project. This
                    project, which is administered by the National Archives and Records
                    Administration’s Office of Presidential Libraries, was designed to coordinate
                    the declassification of still-classified records held in various Presidential
                    libraries. As a result of the way in which records were scanned for the RAC, the
                    editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series were not always
                    able to determine whether attachments to a given document were in fact attached
                    to the paper copy of the docu<pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>ment in the
                    Carter Library file. In such cases, some editors of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series have indicated this ambiguity by stating that
                    the attachments were “Not found attached.”</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                    <hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Documents in this volume are presented chronologically according to time in
                    Washington, DC. Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and
                    date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Editing and Publishing
                    Division. The original document is reproduced as exactly as possible, including
                    marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes. Texts are
                    transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the publication of
                    historical documents within the limitations of modern typography. A heading has
                    been supplied by the editors for each document included in the volume. Spelling,
                    capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the original text,
                    except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes
                    and omissions in the documents are corrected by bracketed insertions: a
                    correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases
                    underlined in the original document are printed in italics. Abbreviations and
                    contractions are preserved as found in the original text, and a list of
                    abbreviations and terms is included in the front matter of each volume. In
                    telegrams, the telegram number (including special designators such as Secto) is
                    printed at the start of the text of the telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld after
                    declassification review have been accounted for and are listed in their
                    chronological place with headings, source notes, and the number of pages not
                    declassified.</p>
                <p>All brackets that appear in the original document are so identified in the
                    footnotes. All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the sources of the document and its
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <pb n="VI" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation of the series and declassification of records. The Advisory
                    Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the
                    series, but it makes recommendations on issues that come to its attention and
                    reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory

                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2014 and was completed in
                    2015, resulted in the decision to withhold 0 documents in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in 0 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in 0 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and edito<pb n="VII" facs="0008"

                <p>This volume documents the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                    administration’s efforts to conduct public diplomacy. A primary emphasis of the
                    volume is the fundamental role that the United States Information Agency
                    (subsequently the United States International Communication Agency) played in
                    the formulation and implementation of public diplomacy. The documentation
                    focuses on the merger of the Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and
                    Cultural Affairs (<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>) and the United States
                    Information Agency in late 1977 and the establishment of the United States
                    International Communication Agency in early 1978; the reports and
                    recommendations of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Information and the U.S.
                    Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs; the
                    production and dissemination of USIA/ICA research reports, briefing papers, and
                    surveys; the conceptualization and administration of broadly-based cultural
                    initiatives such as ARTS AMERICA; the development of initiatives designed to
                    celebrate the American Constitution bicentennial; foreign responses to exhibits,
                    films, radio and television programs; a new emphasis on younger, foreign
                    audiences; and USIA/ICA’s efforts to adapt to and utilize new forms of
                    technology to refresh and enhance its programming.</p>
                <p>The volume also draws attention to the Department of State’s public diplomacy
                    efforts. The documentation focuses on people-to-<pb n="X" facs="0011"
                        xml:id="pg_X"/>people, cultural, and educational exchanges, administered in
                    the Department by <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>. Following the integration
                    of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> into <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                        >USIA</gloss>, senior officials worked to strengthen the institutional
                    relationships between the two agencies. The volume also includes documentation
                    on the Department’s initiative to inform the American public about U.S. foreign
                    policy and the world.</p>
                <p>Within the White House, the President and his primary advisers grappled with the
                    organizational and intellectual challenges posed by the <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                        >CU</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> merger and establishment
                    of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                        >Carter</persName>, in creating <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>,
                    emphasized not only <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>’s charge to inform the
                    world about American society but also <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>’s new
                    role of informing the American public about the world, what <gloss
                        target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> would term the “reverse” or “second mandate.”
                    The documentation reveals the ways in which <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                        >Carter</persName>, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs
                        <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Zbigniew Brzezinski</persName>, and other
                    advisers pushed USIA/ICA Director <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">John
                        Reinhardt</persName> and his agency to develop programming and initiatives
                    to support foreign policy successes such as the Camp David Accords and respond
                    to crises such as the taking of U.S. hostages in Iran, the Soviet invasion of
                    Afghanistan, the 1980 Olympic boycott, and Cuban refugees. In addition, the
                    volume also highlights <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s
                    appointments to the Board for International Broadcasting, Radio Free
                    Europe/Radio Liberty, and the advisory commissions on information and cultural
                    affairs.</p>

                <p>The Presidential papers of <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName>
                    are a key source of high-level decision making documentation on public
                    diplomacy. A number of collections from the National Security Affairs (NSA)
                    files are relevant to research in this area. Within the <persName
                        corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName> Material, the Agency File
                    (particularly the files for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, <gloss
                        target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>, Department of State, BIB/VOA/RFE/RL)
                    contains the most relevant documentation, especially concerning the 1977 <gloss

                    Material, the Horn/Special File, containing the files of <gloss

                    broadcasting. Also of interest in the Staff Material collection are the

                    the Europe, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and East/West File, and the

                    engaged in a series of public diplomacy initiatives related to Europe and Latin
                    America, and their files contain valuable information on public diplomacy and
                    disarmament and the creation of the <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Hubert H.
                        Humphrey</persName> North-South Scholarships. Beyond the National Security
                    Affairs files, the White House Central Files are also an excellent source of
                    documentation on public diplomacy. The Subject Files yield substantial material
                    on <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"

                    governmental and non-governmental educational and informational exchanges, and
                    the President’s relationships with foreign press.</p>
                <p>The National Archives and Records Administration also houses essential
                    documentation on the conduct of public diplomacy during the <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration. Within the Department

                    Record Group 306, the records of the United States Information Agency/United
                    States International Communication Agency. These collections are a rich source
                    of information about USIA/USICA’s ever-evolving organizational structure and its
                    various programs and products. The <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction</p>
                    <p>Those of us who have endorsed this statement speak only for ourselves. We
                        believe our views are shared by many of our colleagues in the Washington
                        elements of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and in the 110 countries
                        around the world in which our programs operate. Moreover, we believe this
                        statement represents a positive and reasoned approach to the conduct of
                        American public diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>We are convinced that the overseas information and cultural programs of our
                        government can be made more responsive and more effective. To that end, we
                        propose redefining the function of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>,
                        and reorganizing it to support that function.</p>
                    <p>Much of what we propose is not new. We believe that a realistic and workable
                        public diplomacy can be conducted within the framework of the original
                        mandate set out for the country’s information and cultural programs in the
                        Smith-Mundt Act of 1948:</p>
                    <quote>

                        <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has been largely ignored by the
                        Executive Branch and threatened by the Congress over the past decade. Our
                        accomplishments <pb n="2" facs="0051" xml:id="pg_2"/>have come in spite of,
                        rather than because of, those to whom we are accountable. Not surprisingly,
                        our achievements have fallen short of our potential. We believe the time has
                        come to establish realistic goals and to seek the active support of the
                        Administration in providing the leadership and resource stability needed to
                        achieve those goals.</p>
                    <p>Our statement includes three major recommendations:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>government-wide agreement that the mission of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> is not to manipulate foreign attitudes, but to seek
                            understanding of American policy as well as the society and values from
                            which it flows;</p>
                        <p>acceptance of an operating style characterized by open, frank discussion
                            of issues (including responsible non-government opinion) and the
                            depiction of American society and culture in all its diverse
                            aspects;</p>
                        <p>integration of the Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and
                            Cultural Affairs into a revitalized, independent <gloss

                    </quote>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Role of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our Agency was formed in an age when the media were regarded as powerful
                        weapons in the battle for men’s minds. If propaganda could be directed
                        against the enemy in wartime, it was argued, why not use the same means in
                        peacetime to win friends? <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has long
                        since outgrown that simplistic view. We know that manipulation through
                        international communication fails on two counts: its pursuit represents a
                        naive conception of human nature and a self-defeating contradiction of the
                        values we seek to represent in the world.</p>
                    <p>We also know that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is a comparatively
                        small voice in an increasingly sophisticated and noisy communications
                        environment. Our role must be carefully defined, lest our message be lost in
                        the babble of competing voices.</p>
                    <p>The basic task of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has always been to
                        support American foreign policy. From this mission devolves a responsibility
                        not only for the careful representation of government policies, but also for
                        the candid depiction of American society and values.</p>
                    <p>In the long run, the response of foreign nations to our policies will be
                        motivated first by their own self-interest, and second by their perception
                        of ours. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> can sharpen these
                        perceptions and can seek understanding. But we cannot change deep-seated
                        attitudes. Rather than trying to make policy more palatable, we must strive
                        to make it more understandable. And rather than trying to make America more
                        lovable, we must strive to make it more comprehensible.</p>
                    <p>If this definition of our role as one of representing foreign policy and
                        depicting American society is more modest than the rhetoric of past years,
                        we believe it will lead to a program that is more fruitful.</p>
                    <p>Although what we say is necessarily limited by our resources, our message
                        must encompass the diversity of our pluralistic society. We <pb n="3"
                            facs="0052" xml:id="pg_3"/>must not fear portraying America as it is.
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should be expected to present
                        persuasively the Administration’s policies along with responsible
                        non-government opinion, even though such opinion may at times be critical of
                        those policies. Presenting the diversity of American opinion produces
                        long-term benefits which far exceed the occasional short-term risks.</p>
                    <p>To represent our society and its values with candor and to enunciate the
                        policies of the government with precision, we believe the proper mode of
                        discourse is the dialogue, in the sense suggested by <persName
                            corresp="#p_AH_1">Harry Ashmore</persName>: “As opposed to argument or
                        debate, dialogue is not intended to resolve issues, but to clarify and
                        illuminate them. It is essentially a rational exercise by which differences
                        may be narrowed and perception improved.”</p>
                    <p>We recommend dialogue not because American views will necessarily prevail,
                        but because rational discussion will best ensure their fair exposure in the
                        world marketplace of ideas.</p>
                    <p>Dialogue involves listening as well as speaking. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> has traditionally reported on foreign public opinion. We
                        urge that this role continue. Otherwise the dialogue we advocate becomes a
                        monologue—we speak and they listen. Even if government action is
                        infrequently influenced by foreign public opinion, it should at least be
                        heard before policy is formed.</p>
                    <p>In summary, we urge the promotion of responsible discussion abroad of
                        American policies and purposes, and the repudiation of the sometimes
                        captivating but superficial notion that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>’s goal should be simply to win friends and influence
                        people. There is, we submit, a considerable difference between responsible
                        and representative public diplomacy (which we advocate) and public relations
                        (which we reject).</p>

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has long been plagued by arguments
                        over whether we should address mass audiences or opinion leaders. We dispute
                        those who would exclude either; the relationship is clearly complementary.
                        Moreover, a nation which represents the Jeffersonian principle of full
                        public participation in decision-making can hardly disavow this ideal abroad
                        by channeling its efforts only to elites. In fact, it is because of our
                        concern with publics outside government that the mission of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is fundamentally different from that of
                        the Department of State. However, our interest in communicating with the
                        broadest possible audience must be tempered by budgetary pragmatism and by
                        an awareness of inter-cultural sensitivities.</p>
                    <p>As a practical matter, mass audiences are accessible, if at all, only through
                        the Voice of America or through materials placed in the indigenous media.
                        With the press, television, and other media in most coun<pb n="4"
                            facs="0053" xml:id="pg_4"/>tries subject to government control or
                        sanction, placement of all but the least controversial materials is
                        frequently limited. Access to the media in democratic societies is less a
                        question of ideology than of willingness to accept materials from a foreign
                        government, even a friendly one. In each case, access is at the pleasure of
                        the media gatekeepers (e.g., editors, producers, and commentators), with
                        whom we must unquestionably seek to develop a relationship of mutual trust.
                        For unless we first establish a dialogue with those who control the foreign
                        media, we will fail in the broader dialogue between America and the people
                        of other nations.</p>
                    <p>There are other publics whom we must continue to address because of their
                        pre-eminent role in the development of ideas: scholars, artists, writers,
                        and government officials concerned with education, information, and cultural
                        affairs. We look upon them as essential interpreters in the process of
                        cross-cultural communications.</p>
                    <p>U.S. officials must also maintain close personal contact with administrators,
                        foreign affairs officials, military officers, and business leaders. However,
                        it is clear that other elements of the American mission abroad—particularly
                        State, Defense, and Commerce—must bear primary responsibility for these
                        relationships. We can often support these contacts with media skills and
                        resources, but our primary concern should remain those audiences with whom
                        we uniquely share a community of interest.</p>
                    <p>In this information-rich age, we must carefully shape our programs in each
                        country to complement the existing patterns of influence, culture, and
                        communication. This strategy requires both mass communication and personal
                        contact.</p>

                            corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> Panel comments on the essentiality
                        of public diplomacy, we disagree with its proposals for reorganization. They
                        would compound the fragmentation that already exists in Washington—the
                        separation of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> (the State Department’s Bureau of
                        Educational and Cultural Affairs)—and would create fragmentation overseas
                        where none exists.</p>
                    <p>The purposes of public diplomacy are best served, we believe, by an
                        independent organization combining <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"

                        the State Department’s educational and cultural exchange program overseas.
                        Our programming experience has shown that the present distinction between
                        information and cultural programs is arbitrary and awkward. Both relate to
                        policy; both relate to the society we represent.</p>
                    <p>By bringing <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> together, we can ensure that the dialogue we
                        seek involves the flow of ideas and people to, as well as from, the United
                        States. We are confident that this can be accomplished without violating the
                        Congressional stricture that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> not be
                        used by any Administration to pursue domestic political goals, nor to
                        mobilize American public opinion in support of Administration
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> Panel would have <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> join the State Department, with the
                        Voice of America remaining outside as an independent agency. In support of
                        this proposal, the <persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> Panel
                        argued that the differences between association with State and continued
                        independence “are more cosmetic than substantive.” We wish to argue that the
                        differences are substantive indeed, and must follow logically from the
                        definition of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s role. If that role is
                        primarily advocacy of State Department policy, we rightly belong in the
                        Department of State. If, on the other hand, it is the representation of U.S.
                        Government policies and the depiction of American society, it follows that
                        our continued independence must be assured. But neither role is enhanced by
                        the creation of new and overlapping bureaucracies.</p>
                    <p>We advocate the full integration of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> within
                        a revitalized and rechartered <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        committed to the support of American policy through the exchange of persons
                        and ideas.</p>
                    <p>There is a second option which we believe is far less desirable, but still
                        preferable to the fragmented organization proposed by the <persName
                            corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> Panel—combining <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> with all educational and cultural
                        exchange activities in a single inter-cultural communications agency within
                        the Department of State. This position was taken by the State Department
                        which, like <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, has opposed the
                            <persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> Panel reorganizational
                        recommendations.</p>
                    <p>Even if the second option is chosen, we believe that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> should remain closely associated with <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. But we fear that the State Department,
                        whose primary responsibility is the formulation and execution of American
                        foreign policy, will find itself particularly uncomfortable with an
                        independent news gathering and reporting organization to which the Congress
                        recently granted a charter for news integrity. If <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> becomes an element of the State Department, <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s special responsibilities must be
                        protected. And if the redefined role we seek for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> is accepted, it, too, will need special guarantees.</p>
                    <p>As representatives of the U.S. Government serving abroad, we do not seek or
                        expect to be exempted from official accountability for our <pb n="6"
                            facs="0055" xml:id="pg_6"/>actions. Since we are part of the American
                        diplomatic mission, our activities may understandably be regarded by others
                        as indicative of the direction of U.S. policy. Where we present, as we must,
                        dissenting voices, they must be identified clearly as such. And we accept
                        the necessity, in sensitive circumstances, to avoid the creation of
                        dangerous confusion over U.S. policy directions.</p>
                    <p>For this reason, the desire of some employees of the Voice of America for
                        complete and unfettered freedom of action could only be realized were the
                        Voice cut loose from all organizational ties to State or <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>—including access to classified
                        information, the protection and advantages afforded by official status for
                        its employees overseas, and the negotiation for and protection of its
                        overseas transmitters by our embassies.</p>
                    <p>We think this extreme course inadvisable. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> is an integral part of our information program. We believe
                        that its employees can perform with journalistic integrity alongside their
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> colleagues, and that the
                        requirement for <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> news to be reliable and
                        authoritative can be further protected if our redefined goals are
                        accepted.</p>
                    <p>Whatever structure is chosen, we support the goals proposed by the Department
                        of State for strengthening a reorganized international communications
                        organization:</p>

                    <p>We recognize and strongly support the need for organizational change. And we
                        believe that one organization, not two, should be responsible for

                            corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> Panel proposals to divide the
                        functions of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. We endorse the
                        consolidation of public diplomacy within a restructured, independent <gloss

                    <p>Finally, there is the question of leadership. If caution is the preserve of
                        the State Department, boldness must be that of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>. The necessary catalyst for successful public diplomacy is
                        leadership which is politically sophisticated, culturally sensitive,
                        experienced in international communications, and dedicated to the pursuit of
                        ideas and the promotion of understanding.</p>
                    <p>We believe the national interest is best served by a public diplomacy based
                        on dialogue. And we believe the considerable energy and talent of the

                        communication between “the industrialized democracies” on issues of common
                        concern. These issues have fallen primarily in the political-military and
                        economic fields but also cover environmental concerns, energy problems and
                        conceptual differences on arms control and disarmament policies.</p>

                        have also been active participants in these meetings designed to bring
                        ourselves, the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> countries and the Japanese
                            <pb n="9" facs="0058" xml:id="pg_9"/>closer together on major issues of
                        concern. The objective of the Trilateral Commission (<gloss
                            target="#t_TLC_1">TLC</gloss>) from the outset has basically been a
                        communication objective and this is why some of us have felt that <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> could play a useful role in contributing
                        to the efforts of this and similar organizations.</p>
                    <p>In underscoring the need for greater communication on the issues, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and President-elect
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> have referred to the
                        importance of continuing exchanges between North America, Western Europe
                        (EC/OECD) and Japan in Asia in view of their similar interests and concerns,
                        particularly in the security and economic areas. The assumption here is that
                        any breakdown in this communication could have serious consequences in terms
                        of our own policy interests and also from the standpoint of international
                        stability since it would provide potential adversaries with opportunities to
                        exploit differences in advancing their objectives.</p>
                    <p>The communication problem is now very acute in the case of Japan and the
                            <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> over the current trade imbalance
                        problem and a reading of the press in Western Europe and Japan will indicate
                        a certain paranoia on both sides. In a recent statement in Antwerp (November
                        23) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HDR_1">Deane Hinton</persName> referred
                        to the possibility of a new wave of restrictionism which would not be an
                        answer to concerns over Japanese-European trade imbalances: “What is called
                        for is a balanced recognition by all parties that a problem may exist and a
                        need to be sensitive to the concern of others.”</p>
                    <p>This brings me to the purpose of this message which is to inform you of
                        current initiatives by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> in Brussels
                        and Tokyo designed to facilitate more effective communication between
                        ourselves, the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> and Japan on the economic
                        issues of common concern. Our intended audience is the media (economic
                        editors and commentators) and also includes those economic specialists from
                        the academic and other fields who contribute to the media.</p>
                    <p>Largely as the result of Art Hoffman’s active interest and cooperation in
                        Brussels and good spadework by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Tokyo,
                        we now have European and Japanese media leaders interested in a special
                        exchange effort to improve public understanding of the major economic issues
                        with which we are all confronted. Hoffman worked with us to facilitate the
                        recent visit to Brussels of Yasuo Takeyama, influential editor of <hi
                            rend="italic">Nihon Keizai,</hi> Japan’s <hi rend="italic">Wall Street
                            Journal.</hi> Takeyama was very impressed by the briefings arranged by
                        Hoffman which gave him an entirely new perspective on the gravity of the
                        situation in Europe in relation to Japan’s image in Europe and he returned
                        to Tokyo determined to do something about it.</p>
                    <p>Good follow-up work by Hoffman and Miller and his staff in Tokyo have now
                        produced these results:</p>

                    <p>1. The Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association headed by our
                        friend Masaaki Kasagi of <gloss target="#t_CULCON_1">CULCON</gloss> is now
                        proposing a major symposium in Tokyo next fall bringing economic editors and
                        commentators together representing the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and Japan. Kasagi, working closely
                        with Takeyama, will use the new Press Center forum in Tokyo for this
                        symposium.</p>
                    <p>2. Considering the immediacy of the problems, Kasagi further proposed a
                        preliminary meeting of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, Japanese and
                        European correspondents stationed in Japan late this month which their
                        Foreign Press Center will organize. Hoffman has been invited to attend this
                        meeting which will provide him with an exceptional opportunity to meet
                        Japanese journalists concerned with <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>3. Takeyama, concerned by his findings in Brussels, now plans a series of
                        three seminars sponsored by his paper in Europe working with European
                        editors in a special attempt to communicate more effectively on the current
                        trade issues. The first of these will be on February 10 in Brussels.</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> Information Offices in Brussels and
                        Tokyo and the <gloss target="#t_IPI_1">IPI</gloss> in London have all
                        expressed keen interest in the exchange proposals and believe they will do
                        much to clear the air on some of the fundamental misunderstandings. Peter
                        Galliner, Director of the <gloss target="#t_IPI_1">IPI</gloss>, will visit
                        with Hoffman in Brussels this month to discuss European input on the
                        exchanges and Art indicates that the <hi rend="italic">Financial Times</hi>
                        may play a role similar to <hi rend="italic">Nihon Keizai’s</hi> on
                        symposium sponsorship on the European end.</p>
                    <p>The above will give you some idea of how fast things are now moving as the
                        result of these <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> initiatives. It may
                        also provide useful background for the upcoming <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>-Japan Friendship Commission Meeting on January 10, since I
                        believe it is the type of project in which our more pragmatic media,
                        business and Congressional representatives should have a very keen interest.
                        We are dealing here with gut issues rather than some of the frothier aspects
                        of cultural exchange.</p>

                    <p>In the address taped on January 19, President-elect <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> reinforced the themes he planned to
                        emphasize during his January 20 inaugural address:</p>
                    <p>“I have chosen the occasion of my inauguration as President to speak not only
                        to my own countrymen—which is traditional—but also to you, citizens of the
                        world who did not participate in our election but who will nevertheless be
                        affected by my decisions.</p>
                    <p>“I also believe that as friends you are entitled to know how the power and
                        influence of the United States will be exercised by its new Government.</p>
                    <p>“I want to assure you that the relations of the United States with the other
                        countries and peoples of the world will be guided during my own
                        administration by our desire to shape a world order that is more responsive
                        to human aspirations. The United States will meet its obligation to help
                        create a stable, just, and peaceful world order.</p>
                    <p>“We will not seek to dominate nor dictate to others. As we Americans have
                        concluded one chapter in our Nation’s history and are beginning to work on
                        another, we have, I believe, acquired a more mature perspective on the
                        problems of the world. It is a perspective which recognizes the fact that we
                        alone do not have all the answers to the world’s problems.</p>
                    <p>“The United States alone cannot lift from the world the terrifying specter of
                        nuclear destruction. We can and will work with others to do so.</p>
                    <p>“The United States alone cannot guarantee the basic right of every human
                        being to be free of poverty and hunger and disease and political repression.
                        We can and will cooperate with others in combating these enemies of
                        mankind.</p>
                    <p>“The United States alone cannot ensure an equitable development of the world
                        resources or the proper safeguarding of the world’s environment. But we can
                        and will join with others in this work.</p>
                    <p>“The United States can and will take the lead in such efforts.</p>
                    <pb n="12" facs="0061" xml:id="pg_12"/>
                    <p>“In these endeavors we need your help, and we offer ours. We need your
                        experience; we need your wisdom.</p>
                    <p>“We need your active participation in a joint effort to move the reality of
                        the world closer to the ideals of human freedom and dignity.</p>
                    <p>“As friends, you can depend on the United States to be in the forefront of
                        the search for world peace. You can depend on the United States to remain
                        steadfast in its commitment to human freedom and liberty. And you can also
                        depend on the United States to be sensitive to your own concerns and
                        aspirations, to welcome your advice, to do its utmost to resolve
                        international differences in a spirit of cooperation.</p>
                    <p>“The problems of the world will not be easily resolved. Yet the well-being of
                        each and every one of us—indeed our mutual survival—depends on their
                        resolution. As President of the United States I can assure you that we
                        intend to do our part. I ask you to join us in a common effort based on
                        mutual trust and mutual respect.</p>
                    <p>“Thank you.”</p>
                    <p>The United States Information Agency distributed the address to 26 countries

                    <p>Such studies have been conducted irregularly in recent years, with the result

                        found, when opinion polls are not conducted regularly, that the Agency is
                        vulnerable to charges of political motivation in the scheduling of a survey
                        at a particular time. The use of regular periodic surveys will avoid these
                        problems and will serve basic Agency needs in providing useful insights into

                    <p>The research tool employed in such studies is the so-called “rider” survey.
                        It comprises roughly a dozen questions piggy-backed on ongoing national
                        polls taken by leading commercial contractors. These riders are an integral

                        European countries, augmented by the Netherlands and Norway as

                        states. The thrust of the inquiry will be to identify those perceptions and
                        expectations of the incoming U.S. administration that are overriding in
                        European public opinion, as distinguished from leadership and media opinion.
                        Within that compass, the focus will be on Atlantic security and
                        international economic concerns to coincide with the administration’s
                        priority issues. In this sense, and indeed in its broad perspective as well,
                        the survey results should provide unique information useful beyond purely

                    </p>
                    <p>The present paper is one of two embodying a review of indications from
                        surveys abroad from 1955 to 1976 that bear upon foreign perceptions of U.S.
                        military strength and foreign opinion on issues relating to arms
                        control.</p>
                    <p>The objectives of these papers are to contribute guidance for Agency
                        programming to the degree that available information is still <pb n="15"
                            facs="0064" xml:id="pg_15"/>applicable, and guidance to Agency research
                        as to where more current measurements are desirable.</p>
                    <p>Brief comments on some of the major indications are included below, not as in
                        any sense firm conclusions, but in the interest of stimulating thought on
                        the meaning of the data and their progam implications.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Some Comments and Program Implications</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The available indications from surveys taken abroad in recent years would
                        seem to point to a declining trend in the U.S. strength image compared to
                        that of the U.S.S.R. But it is important to appreciate that most of the
                        evidence is in the form of anticipations expressed in the past about the
                        state of affairs in the future. Needless to say, perceptions of actual U.S.
                        strength at the present time may differ from past anticipations.
                        Accordingly, updated measurements of current perceptions are pressingly
                        needed before coming to any hard and fast conclusions about how opinion on
                        U.S. strength compares with that of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the primary program suggestion that emerges from the present review
                        of foreign perceptions of U.S. strength is that in any efforts to enhance an
                        image of preeminence the emphasis in program output should be less on
                        nuclear strength or even military strength, and more on overall power. It is
                        in this most generalized view that the U.S. apparently stands best vis-a-vis
                        its principal adversaries. With such factors as economic strength,
                        technological strength and political influence in the balance U.S. might
                        looms larger in foreign perceptions than in a narrower focus upon military
                        or strategic capabilities.</p>
                    <p>In regard to preferences expressed abroad for U.S. vs. Soviet superiority in
                        strength it would seem at first blush that it can only be considered an
                        adverse reflection on the U.S. to find that even among its closest allies
                        the predominant preference is not for U.S. superiority but rather for
                        equality with the U.S.S.R. Such judgments would seem to suggest a lack of
                        trust in the U.S. to use a preponderance of power in ways that serve the
                        best interests of its allies. But while there is some evidence for such
                        negative sentiments it is far from the whole story. Exploration of the
                        reasons voiced in the present connection suggest that in the minds of many
                        security is best assured by parity. The superiority of one side means the
                        inferiority of the other, and efforts to catch up tend to perpetuate an arms
                        race. Parity means greater stability and can be the basis of arms control
                        and disarmament.</p>
                    <p>In any case, whatever the adverse connotations in some respects, preference
                        for U.S.–U.S.S.R. equivalence in strength would seem to have its
                        advantageous side at the present time. It suggests that foreign public
                        opinion is not only predominantly prepared to accept but indeed <pb n="16"
                            facs="0065" xml:id="pg_16"/>to applaud equality in U.S. and Soviet
                        strength. If parity is the state of affairs to which the U.S. must reconcile
                        itself, it is reassuring to know that such a position is not likely to
                        result in widespread concern and trepidation among the peoples of the Free
                        World.</p>
                    <p>There is a further thought here in regard to Agency programming. If the U.S.
                        must settle for parity with the U.S.S.R. in strength it obviously best
                        serves U.S. interests to represent such a situation as less a course that
                        the U.S. has had thrust upon it and more a course that it has chosen. The
                        U.S. could thus represent the decision as reflecting the arguments already
                        described that appeal to many abroad—that parity means greater stability and
                        is a better basis for negotiations in arms control and disarmament.</p>
                    <p>But whatever the advantages of parity there is the disturbing possibility
                        brought to light in the survey data that perceptions of less than U.S.
                        preeminence in strength in the future may be approved, but at the same time
                        be accompanied by lesser respect for the U.S. and lesser confidence in its
                        leadership in foreign affairs. This is a serious finding if true. But before
                        such a bleak conclusion is accepted much more confirmation is needed. The
                        strength question upon which this analysis was based was of the “who’s
                        strongest” variety and did not explicitly deal with the position of
                        U.S.–U.S.S.R. equivalence. Thus further exploration is needed to see whether
                        those who specifically affirm an equivalence of U.S. and Soviet strength
                        have any less respect for and confidence in the U.S. than those who envision
                        continued U.S. superiority in the future.</p>
                    <p>The effects of Sputnik I<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2">Reference is to the first

                        elevating perceptions of Soviet strength, nuclear and otherwise, is clearly
                        a thing of the past. It is fair to presume since the moon landing that any
                        spinoff from space spectaculars works more to U.S. advantage. On the other
                        hand the explosion of the Soviet superbomb in 1961,<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d5fn3">Reference is presumably to Soviet detonation of a 50

                        initial impact, has no doubt contributed to some enduring beliefs in larger
                        Soviet weapons. How important a 100 megaton bomb may appear, however, when
                        lesser bombs are already so overwhelming may be questioned. So possibly U.S.
                        emphasis on numbers and accuracy is probably well advised in enhancing
                        appreciation of U.S. capabilities.</p>
                    <p>All in all, it should not be presumed that the U.S.S.R. is perceived as ahead
                        of the U.S. at the present time in nuclear strength. While the largest
                        proportion of the public abroad is likely to perceive an <pb n="17"
                            facs="0066" xml:id="pg_17"/>approximate standoff, especially in view of
                        repeated American statements affirming equivalence, it well may be that
                        among those believing otherwise the U.S. continues to hold the edge it
                        manifested when last measured in mid-1972.</p>
                    <p>Finally, not the least food for thought in the survey indications are

                        the great powers have sagged somewhat in perceptions of strength in absolute

                        comparative strength. But it can suggest a diminished importance in public
                        opinion of the question of who’s ahead in a world where lesser countries are

                        to stand at the rear of the theater or sit in the aisles”. The Polish and
                        diplomatic audience heaped “superlatives” on the film, not only for its
                        artistic merit (“This film should get all the Oscars in the world”), but (in
                        the Embassy’s judgment) for “. . . its deeper philosophical implications,”
                        which were readily grasped by the audience and characterized by an important
                        Polish film director who said, “This is a film about us. You have to be from
                        this part of the world (referring to film director Milos Forman) to make
                        such a film—in America”.</p>
                    <p>Aside from the impressive effect of CUCKOO’S NEST on the audience as a
                        cinematic tour de force, the Embassy foresees a “multiplier effect” in
                        pressure on the Polish authorities to obtain the film for public showing.
                        The anticipated refusal of Polish authorities to import it for public
                        release would “demonstrate another dimension to the Polish (government)
                        claims about importing so many Western films: that such acquisition is
                        selective and politically regulated and not determined by any artistic
                        merit”.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy has followed this message with a new request, to show the film at
                        a second invited program for Polish psychiatrists. Permission has been
                        requested from United Artists.<note n="4" xml:id="d6fn4">In telegram 660

                        have arranged exchanges of farm youth and farm families during the past ten
                        years. Americans and foreign participants live with farm families, travel
                        widely and exchange experiences with large numbers of people. In 1976, <hi

                        send American high school students abroad for a year and receive foreign
                        students in the United States. Participants live with host families and
                        attend local schools. More than 6,000 foreign and 3,000 U.S. students
                        participate each year under programs conducted by the <hi rend="italic"

                        elected state and local government officials to Africa this summer for
                        30-day visits.</p>
                    <p>—The Department of State’s <hi rend="italic">International Visitor
                            Program</hi> is a central aspect of our people-to-people activity. Under
                        it, each year we bring more than 2,000 foreign leaders to the United States
                        for visits of approximately 30 days. The International Visitors spend
                        several days in Washington and visit other cities in the United States
                        according to their professional interests, meeting and exchanging views with
                        U.S. counterparts.</p>
                    <p>—Home hospitality is provided these officially invited visitors by such
                        organizations as the <hi rend="italic">Atlanta Council for International
                            Visitors</hi>, one of 90 local organizations throughout the United
                        States which cooperate with the Department. More than 100,000 volunteers in
                        these organiza<pb n="22" facs="0071" xml:id="pg_22"/>tions help arrange
                        programs in their communities, provide local transportation, and receive the
                        visitors in their homes. Most International Visitors welcome the opportunity
                        to see how Americans live in their homes, and they describe home hospitality
                        as the high point of their visits.</p>
                    <p>—The Department also promotes improved two-way links with foreign countries
                        through the <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName> academic
                        exchange program which it administers. Each year approximately 3,000 U.S.
                        and foreign students, research scholars, teachers and lecturers are
                        exchanged with over 100 countries. In Western Europe, our Allies consider
                        these programs of great importance and share their funding with us on an
                        approximately equal basis. Through these programs we are able to take
                        cognizance of the long-range needs of the industrial democracies in the
                        sciences, arts and humanities, and to help establish permanent linkages
                        between centers of higher learning. Academic exchanges are also conducted
                        with the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe. As a result,
                        there is a new generation of scholars who have lived and studied here and
                        abroad, and thereby have a better understanding of other countries, and
                        their own.</p>
                    <p>I will ask <persName corresp="#p_DJD_1">Joe Duffey</persName> to review these
                        programs to see whether there is more that we can and should be doing in the
                        areas described above. Joe will also be seeing Reverend <persName

                                >Carter</persName> stated: “It was a tremendous exhibition of the

                            Georgians spoke Portuguese—to learn about us and for us to learn about
                            them. So we’re going to try to do this on a nationwide basis and ask
                            those of you who are interested, either the Governors or their spouses,
                            to be thinking about it, and later on you’ll get a letter concerning it.
                            And perhaps your own State this first year would like to just take one
                            airplane, and we’ve asked the State Department to give us advice. And we
                            would like to have somebody go, maybe a couple of hundred folks go from,
                            say, Idaho, to perhaps Morocco, and let 200 Moroccans come back.” (<hi

                        side and “broad public forces which realize how senseless and dangerous is
                        the arms race” on the side of the angels. As such, this would be just
                        another piece of <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss> boilerplate on the

                        these enemies of detente make use of “state bodies, such as the U.S.

                        and review process. Although everyone participating does not agree with all

                        of them I made a few changes which have not been seen before by the offices.

                        can make a contribution to better mutual understanding and favorably
                        influence the international climate. Ongoing and proposed programs
                        implemented by <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> and the posts overseas in
                        support of these objectives <pb n="28" facs="0077" xml:id="pg_28"/>must be
                        consistent with the principles outlined in the <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss> Concept Paper. Their ultimate purposes are an enhanced level
                        of mutual understanding and cooperative relations between the U.S. and other
                        societies. These objectives will provide a coherent framework for describing
                        the focus and content of our various activities.</p>
                    <p>The next step in our scenario is for each area and functional office (with
                        program funds) to define specific (one or more as appropriate) aims which
                        will contribute to the furtherance of those objectives appropriate to the
                        mission of each office. In preparation for this next phase offices should
                        select those <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> program objectives which are
                        relevant to their respective regions or functions. It is anticipated that no
                        office will pursue all objectives.</p>
                    <p>Although each office will prepare its own unique aims, it is desirable that a
                        common approach be used. In order to start from the same basic perception
                        each office preparing aims should designate one officer to be the focal
                        point for their preparation. This officer’s name should be provided OPP by
                            <gloss target="#t_COB_1">COB</gloss> February 18. OPP and EX discussions
                        of the goal preparation process will be held on Tuesday the 22nd.</p>
                    <p>Each area’s aims will become a part of the <gloss target="#t_CPP_1"
                            >CPP</gloss> guidance sent to the field with the annual
                        instructions.</p>
                    <p>This effort has been a long and arduous one, but the patience and
                        contributions of all those who have participated is very much appreciated.
                        Now let’s continue to flesh out the system and make it work.</p>

                            international relations. The Bureau encourages the formation of linkages
                            between individuals and institutions across political boundaries and the

                        Board Chairman who is not resident in the Washington area.) The Board
                        probably needs to meet about four times per year for a day or two, maybe
                        longer for the budget meeting, and Board members should (as a group or
                        individually) probably make one visit a year to Munich and some of the radio

                        about certain things:</p>
                    <p>• Board members are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of
                        the Senate.</p>
                    <pb n="31" facs="0080" xml:id="pg_31"/>
                    <p>• Only three may be of the same political party.</p>
                    <p>• For each day of service they are compensated at the E–V daily rate ($182.00
                        under the new pay raise), and when traveling they are allowed travel money
                        and per diem. There is no upper limit on compensation for travel or
                        allowances permitted by the law.</p>
                    <p>The law does not specify how often the Board shall meet or how it goes about
                        its business except that it is permitted to establish a staff hired under
                        standard civil service procedures. The division of labor between the Board
                        and its staff is up to it.</p>
                    <p>The law <hi rend="italic">authorizes</hi> the Board to make grants to <gloss
                            target="#t_RFERL_1">RFE/RL</gloss> (including monies received from other

                        kept within the broad foreign policy objectives of the U.S., to encourage
                        efficiency and economy, to make audits, prescribe regulations and report
                        annually to the President and the Congress. The law does not specify how the
                        Board is to exercise these functions. This concluding general provision of
                        the law is interesting:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>“In carrying out the foregoing functions, the Board shall bear in mind
                            the necessity of maintaining the professional independence and integrity
                            of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>The Secretary of State is charged in the law with responsibility for
                        providing the Board “with such information regarding the foreign policy of

                    <p>Attached is the first, hastily prepared weekly foreign media reaction report
                        which you requested yesterday.</p>
                    <p>The material for this paper was compiled from the regular reporting which the
                        Agency receives from overseas and represents only readily available sources
                        on hand. For future reports we will, of course, specify the subjects our
                        posts should monitor and thereby gain a wider coverage.</p>
                    <p>Normally you will receive this report on Thursdays, as you requested.
                        However, since many publications appear on Fridays (e.g., <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Economist</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The Spectator</hi>, <hi
                            rend="italic">The New Statesman</hi>), we will either need to prepare a
                        Friday supplement or choose a different day for sending the weekly
                        report.</p>
                    <p>In the course of writing this paper, questions arose regarding both its style
                        and content, and we will resolve them in early discussions with <persName

                    <p>Finally, because of the press of time we have relied heavily on direct
                        quotations to indicate the substance of articles. Henceforth we will prepare
                        substantive summaries and use only the most striking, revealing
                        quotations.</p>

                        <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> has begun to
                            discover what a thicket he has to plunge through in his search for a
                            nuclear arms deal with Russia. He is shoving gallantly forward. . . . It
                            is increasingly difficult to go on <pb n="33" facs="0082" xml:id="pg_33"
                            />believing that the negotiations about nuclear weapons can be kept in
                            two different compartments, one for ‛strategic’ weapons to be discussed
                            between America and Russia alone, the other for ‛tactical’ ones which
                            also involve their European allies. Some people argue that it may be
                            necessary, before long, to reorganize the negotiations to recognize that
                            fact. Any such all-in nuclear negotiations would be a hideous tangle.
                            But it seems increasingly likely that any <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"

                            take initiatives, and to show a willingness to come at least half way. .

                            His margin is now either nonexistent or at best wafer-thin. For this
                            reason he cannot afford to dispense with ‛linkage,’ ‛reciprocity,’ or
                            whatever term is in vogue to describe getting a good, tough over-all
                            bargain.” (London <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, conservative,

                            they will easily get the upper hand in the bargaining. . . . According

                            apparently is not ready to shackle its cruise missile. There is reason
                            to take a skeptical view of the possibility of eventual U.S.-Soviet
                            agreement on cruise missiles and Backfire bombers. It would not be wise
                            to pursue a policy of gentlemen’s agreements with Moscow or even a
                            policy of good examples, because such a policy might lead to a dangerous

                    <p>The following is provided in response to subject <gloss target="#t_PRM_1"
                            >PRM</gloss>:</p>
                    <p>1. Define, from the moral viewpoint, what the United States should set as its
                        goals in greater upholding of human rights around the world.</p>
                    <p>2. Analyze the probable short and long term positive and negative effects of
                        a series of alternative human rights policies for the United States.</p>
                    <p>Examine the following options:</p>
                    <p>a. Vigorous unilateral statements by the U.S. naming the nations
                        involved;</p>
                    <p>b. Milder or intermittent unilateral statements and actions, naming the
                        nations involved;</p>
                    <p>c. A multilateral policy, going in step with the United Nations, which
                        sometimes names the nations involved;</p>
                    <p>d. A general declaratory policy, naming no names (the mildest course).</p>
                    <p>3. Analyze the probable result of the suggested analysis which would be a
                        selective policy of promoting human rights, pushing harder on Country A and
                        less on Country B. A very important—perhaps overriding—question is whether
                        consistency is more important than making progress where we can with a
                        selective approach.</p>
                    <p>4. Declare that “the human rights policy of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> is the reflection of deeply felt concerns for human rights
                        by the American people, the President and the Congress.”</p>
                    <p>5. In paragraph 6c of subject <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRM</gloss>, include
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> cultural and informational

                    <p>6. Monitor and provide regular assessments on the most prominent foreign
                        media coverage of U.S. human rights policy and related initiatives.</p>
                    <p>7. Propose that we use the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> Belgrade
                        June 15th meeting as a forum to (a) reinforce our position on the <gloss

                            educational and cultural exchanges.</note> and (b) express concern about
                        allegations that human rights and freedoms incorporated in the Final Act
                        have been denied in several Final Act signatory countries.</p>
                    <p>8. Propose a program to promote positive efforts to encourage favorable human
                        rights trends and to help foster the growth of free political and social
                        institutions.</p>

                        opinions of responsible American governmental and non-governmental leaders.
                        We would even suggest an increase in this activity, perhaps through regular
                        preparation of video-taped interviews or question-and-answer sessions with
                        State Department officials on subjects of intense area interest such as
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s recent trip and
                        for use with Arab or Israeli government, media and academic leaders rather
                        than with the general public. (See also my memo of February 22<note n="5"

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">But at the same time we wish to consider ways to take
                            these activities one step further, making available to the Israeli
                            leadership and public opinion the viewpoints of moderate Arabs, and to
                            the Arab leaders the opinions of moderate Israelis</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The first 30 years of the Arab-Israeli dispute have been characterized by
                        extremist rhetoric emanating from both sides, and amplified by both
                        indigenous and foreign media. Now, with moderates playing significant public
                        roles on both sides of the lines, we would like to assist in amplifying
                        their efforts. For example, a video-tape of an address by an Israeli
                        moderate to an American audience, and his handling of the questions asked by
                        Americans, might encourage moderates among Arab viewers, and
                            conversely.<note n="6" xml:id="d15fn6">

                        the business of showing interviews prepared for American <gloss

                            corresp="#p_RY_1">Rabin</persName> or President Sadat to audiences
                        across the lines. We propose taking the process one step further, showing
                        similar interviews by moderate, non-governmental personalities.</p>
                    <p>To a very limited extent we have already done this, exposing selected Arab
                        and Israeli leaders, usually in the living room of an American diplomat
                        rather than in a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Center, to
                        video-taped expressions of private individuals from the other side. Examples
                        are the televised series entitled “The Arabs and the Israelis” in which
                        Israelis heard the widow of an Egyptian fighter pilot say she bore no
                        ill-will toward Israel but only longed for peace, and in which Arab
                        audiences listened to the father of a dead Israeli infantry officer describe
                        his vision of a peaceful Middle East in which Israelis and Arabs could
                        prosper <pb n="43" facs="0092" xml:id="pg_43"/>together. Another U.S.-made
                        television series shown to selected audiences on both sides of the lines was
                        the dialogue between Israeli author Amos Elon and Samia Hassan, daughter of
                        an Egyptian diplomat, who discussed the entire spectrum of Arab-Israeli
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">What we are proposing now is not only to continue taking
                            advantage of such materials as they become available from other sources,
                            but also to adopt a more positive role in stimulating their making,
                            attempting to direct them toward instead of away from the hard political
                            questions, and seeing that they are circulated where they can make a

                    </p>
                    <p>For example, we would like to obtain video tapes or transcripts of talks and
                        question-and-answer sessions of Israeli “doves” visiting the U.S. These
                        could range from fringe figures such as Matti Peled to politically
                        significant moderates such as former General Yigael Yadin or former Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA_1">Abba Eban</persName>. Similarly,
                        moderate figures from the Arab world, particularly the new breed of
                        polished, American-educated lobbyists, lecturers and academics could be
                        video-taped addressing the questions of American audiences, which presumably
                        would reflect the misgivings or insecurities of subsequent Israeli
                        viewers.</p>
                    <p>We are considering another approach in conjunction with <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>-sponsored American speakers on the
                        Middle East problem. Whether in Israel or the Arab countries, such speakers
                        normally field a series of concerned and suspicious questions which reflect
                        the deep distrust of the ultimate intentions of the other side. We would
                        like to have a speaker such as Malcolm Kerr, for example, meet and talk with
                        a group of Israeli leaders and then, after a time, show them a video-tape of
                        the questions asked him during an earlier, similar session in Syria, Jordan
                        or Egypt.<note n="8" xml:id="d15fn8">
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> placed a vertical line
                            in the left-hand margin next to this sentence.</note> Conversely, we
                        would show Arab audiences a tape of Israelis questioning Dr. Kerr. We think
                        the questions, illustrating feelings of insecurity rather than desires for
                        expansion, might be mutually enlightening.</p>
                    <p>Looking back over the U.S.-Middle Eastern role of the past four years, we see
                        that the first stage in our information effort was to explain the U.S.
                        “honest broker” role, dictated by the fact that U.S. interest in a permanent
                        settlement is as great as the interests of the direct parties to the
                        dispute. This stage apparently has been successfully completed in view of
                        the manifest desire of both Arabs and Israelis that the U.S. continue its
                        middle-man role.</p>
                    <pb n="44" facs="0093" xml:id="pg_44"/>
                    <p>The second and ongoing stage of the information effort has been to focus the
                        attention of all parties to the dispute on initiatives to clear away
                        procedural impediments to negotiation and on examining and defining the
                        major problems to be solved.</p>
                    <p>What we now are proposing is a cautious forward step into encouraging both
                        private Americans and area moderates to define the compromises necessary to
                        reach solutions.</p>
                    <p>Such indirect dialogues between Arabs and Israelis, conducted via American
                        intermediaries or partisans, will not by themselves remove the accumulations
                        of distrust and suspicion that make political compromise so difficult.
                        However, they may speed the day when delegations of Israelis and Arabs are
                        willing to begin direct dialogues on neutral territory, or even to venture
                        across the lines to enter into the kind of direct communications that must
                        accompany final stages of a peace settlement. For this reason we see such
                        efforts, sensitively produced by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and
                        sensitively presented at our posts, as a positive means of supporting the
                        intensive U.S. diplomatic efforts concomitant to 1977 peace negotiations. We
                        will welcome your comments, cautions, and guidance in this regard.</p>

                    <p>The Soviet Government when propagating their version of “peaceful

                        “ideological warfare” which the Soviets felt free to pursue militantly: as
                        long as it does not include armed conflict it is perfectly all right to use
                        any other method to promote the ideology of Marxism-Leninism, including
                        subversion and black propaganda. Thus, press, radio and <gloss

                        are, by Soviet standards, within the ground rules of “peaceful coexistence”
                        or “detente” since their supposed intent is merely to advocate the blessings
                        of communist ideology.</p>

                        behalf of the “Wilmington 10.”<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">Reference is to 10
                            individuals arrested, tried, and convicted on arson and conspiracy
                            charges in Wilmington, North Carolina, in February 1971. At the time,
                            African-American students in Wilmington had instituted a boycott against
                            the city’s schools in response to attacks on African-American students
                            prompted by desegregation of the school system. The boycott precipitated
                            various acts of violence, culminating in the firing of shots at
                            firefighters attempting to extinguish an arson fire. The “Wilmington 10”
                            were implicated in this action, despite lack of evidence regarding
                            involvement, and, as a result, were perceived as political prisoners and
                            thus deprived of their human rights. The federal appeals court, in 1980,
                            overturned the convictions on grounds that the defendants’
                            constitutional rights had been violated by both the prosecutor and the
                            trial judge.</note>

                    <p>11. Over the years, the costs of these radios have increased at a far slower
                        rate than costs of weaponry or costs of intelligence-collecting. It can be
                        argued that they are, nevertheless, of major significance for achieving our
                        national security objectives even though they cost—all together—only a
                        minute fraction of what we spend on a single weapons system. As we try to
                        bring our national security expenditures into better balance, we should

                    <p>14. It is <hi rend="italic">alleged</hi> that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"

                        with the Vietnam withdrawal, Watergate, problems of domestic dissidence—a

                        misused by the White House, the State Department or some other element of

                        purposes. Only an “independent” <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> can

                        But critics of radio stations usually run the full gamut of possible

                        judging impact. During the past 10–15 years, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> has settled into a pattern of very competent broadcasting
                        of news, entertainment and features about American life that clearly appeal
                        to listeners and keep them well informed. (I have listened to <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> steadily during my time abroad over the
                        past eight years and consider that it is doing an excellent job of what can
                        reasonably be expected of it.)</p>

                            be under direct U.S. Government management and present itself as the

                        American policies and explain American government positions? Obviously, it
                        should not be narrowly propagandistic, but why assume that a properly led
                        U.S. Government is going to want it to be? Why should the U.S. Government
                        abdicate responsibility for managing a major information instrument in a
                        world that wishes to have American positions and American values explained
                        to it and wishes to be informed on what is happening in the United
                        States?</p>
                    <p>18. An Administration which divested itself of control over <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> might well find that it had created more
                        problems for itself than it had eliminated. There is the danger that <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> could drift into an adversary position
                        against the government; this is probably less serious danger than decline in
                        effectiveness and relevance.</p>
                    <p>19. None of this is to say that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> could
                        not <hi rend="italic">benefit from some improvements.</hi> Tight budgets and
                        strict adherence to civil service requirements have resulted in broadcast
                        staffs that tend toward the elderly and unimaginative. There is a case to be
                        made for broadcasting in more languages, for there is now hardly any corner
                        of the world where cheap radio receivers are not within reach of practically
                        everyone. There is, also a case for reviewing <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss>’s position in our governmental structure and for taking a
                        fresh look at the way in which it is given policy and administrative
                        guidance. But this should be done objectively and by persons free of the
                        partisan views that have grown up around some of these questions in the past
                        few years.</p>
                    <p>20. All of the U.S. Government’s international broadcasting instruments have
                        been essentially <hi rend="italic">marking time</hi> during recent years.
                            <hi rend="italic">Technically, they are all behind their
                            competitors.</hi> A program for strengthening them needs to be put into
                        effect immediately. They have all been kept under such tight budgetary
                        restrictions that they have not been able to experiment with more creative
                        programming approaches or more appealing ways of delivering news and
                        information. They need to be given the means of doing so. Both technically
                        and substantively, they need to be infused with new dynamism. Technical
                        developments which are now on the horizon—direct satellite broadcasting,
                        e.g.—may provide the means of greatly increasing the impact of our
                        international broadcasting instruments a few years from now. We should
                        rejuvenate them so that they can take full advantage of what technological
                        breakthroughs may offer.</p>

                    <p>Many posts indicated they already had begun, or were making preparations, to
                        program the series, primarily in direct invitational screenings for primary
                        target audiences of government officials, political leaders, media
                        representatives, academics, students, business and labor leaders, etc. These
                        would take place at Agency residences, libraries, cultural centers or
                        wherever most convenient for the particular individual or group.</p>
                    <p>Many posts indicated they were attempting to place the program with
                        television stations. The most probable television use would appear to be
                        adaptation and segmentary use in the form of single interviews or excerpted
                        statements, rather than placement in its entirety.</p>
                    <p>Though most posts expressed general satisfaction with the content and format
                        of the series, there were some which were not entirely pleased with the
                        first program. Some dissatisfaction was expressed. The single element most
                        often mentioned was program length. Many felt it should have been kept to 30
                        minutes. Others felt the program’s introduction was too long and that the
                        program should move into the interviews faster. Proving again you can’t
                        satisfy everyone, some posts said the interviews were too short, some said
                        they were too long.</p>
                    <p>Posts with sharp-eyed viewers noted that the opening montage of stills showed
                        all post World War II Presidents except <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1"

                        (and felt that the omission of <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                        was too obvious) and that interviewer Edward P. Morgan wore two different
                        neckties during the program.</p>
                    <p>Most of this “critical” comment was constructive and in the form of
                        suggestions on how future programs could be more targeted to audiences in

                            March 14, the Embassy reported on a recent conversation <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM_1">Toon</persName> had with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> during a reception at Spaso
                            House, wherein <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> expressed
                            concerns regarding the U.S. focus on human rights issues. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> “stated that what was most
                            disturbing was the conclusion drawn that the U.S. has mounted a
                            ‛concerted campaign’ against the Soviet Union.” The Embassy noted that
                            when <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> and Bogdanov were
                            informed that the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            administration had spoken out against human rights abuses in other
                            countries, <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> and Bogdanov
                            focused on <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Russian broadcasts “as
                            the clinching evidence for their assertion.” The Embassy concluded that
                            while the Soviets “have an obvious interest in encouraging a ‛moderate’
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> approach to the <gloss

                            seem to us not only plausible, but highly likely. <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s tone and approach have changed
                            noticeably in recent weeks, and we have distinct impression that
                            guidelines previously in force have been ignored with increasing
                            frequency.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59,
                            Central Foreign Policy File, D770087–0960)</note>

                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and Department are concerned that
                        Embassy finds that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s approach has
                        “changed noticeably in recent weeks.”</p>
                    <p>2. If Embassy’s conclusion is based solely on fact that there has been
                        substantially heavier coverage of human rights stories, the explanation is
                        straightforward: heavier coverage reflects both the administration’s and
                        U.S. public’s focus on the issue. As you are aware, the new human rights
                        emphasis, especially as it affects U.S.-Soviet relations has generated
                        lively and vocal debate. Media coverage, both in the United States and
                        abroad, has been extraordinarily heavy. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        has, of course, reported the statements that have emanated from official
                        sources and the subsequent debate in the press. This the <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has a clear mandate <pb n="59" facs="0108"
                            xml:id="pg_59"/>to do; it reports the news as it occurs and tells its
                        listeners how public opinion reacts to it, largely as reflected in domestic
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and foreign media.</p>
                    <p>3. If, on other hand, Embassy believes that, apart from increased volume of
                        coverage, tone and approach have changed and that guidelines are being
                        ignored, we need examples of materials Embassy finds objectionable and/or
                        inappropriate. Since reftel suggests that part of problem may be manner in
                        which some programs are voiced, it would be helpful to have your specific
                        comments on that aspect of situation as well.</p>
                    <p>4. In the meantime, Embassy should know that broadcasts to the Soviet Union
                        have been under particularly close scrutiny in recent weeks. Indeed, every
                        effort will continue to be made to handle human rights and other sensitive
                        stories in accurate and balanced fashion. In this regard, reftel, as well as
                        Embassy’s earlier communications, are greatly appreciated.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The President’s Report to Congress concludes that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RFERL_1">RFE/RL</gloss> are making
                        optimum use of their present facilities but that they need more transmitter
                        power to do their job effectively over the next few years. The report
                        recommends a program for building new transmitters which will entail modest
                        increases in financial outlays over the next three years. The exact sums
                        which will be requested are not yet known; needs will probably be in the
                        range of $30,000,000. The radios and <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss>
                        will be studying this question. Since funds will be needed over at least the
                        next three years, they will probably not all be requested in this year’s
                        supplemental budget request. The <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> is
                        working on this supplemental budget request now.</p>
                    <p>Considering the rate at which most other categories of U.S. Government
                        expenditures have been rising, these radios have been operating very
                        economically. Even with expansion and modernization, they will be costing
                        only a tiny fraction of the sums we spent on defense and military and
                        economic aid abroad.</p>
                    <p>The President strongly supports the radios and considers them important
                        instruments through which the U.S. Government and the American people assert
                        their strong interest in human rights and the free flow of information.</p>
                    <p>While expansion of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty’s transmitters will
                        affect only broadcasting to Eastern Europe and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"

                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s transmitter power will enable it
                        to reach listeners in many other parts of the world, particularly the lesser
                        developed countries, where expansion of broadcasting by Communist-dominated
                        countries has given them considerable lead over the Free World in recent
                        years.</p>
                    <p>The report <hi rend="italic">does not</hi> deal with the location of <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> within the U.S. Government. The White
                        House is aware that there has been debate on this subject and considers
                        debate and discussion healthy. For the time being there is no plan to shift

                    <p>The report also does not deal with personnel questions on which there has
                        been some recent press speculation. The President is considering nominees
                        for the Chairmanship of the Board for International Broadcasting. <persName

                        voluble and feisty. He had a lot to say about cultural exchange in general,
                        about Turkey (where he visited in November) and about contacts with
                            <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> and other Soviets. His

                    </p>
                    <p>1) <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Leonard Marks</persName>’ verve and energy
                        are impressive. Unless someone has a much better candidate, I recommend he
                        be continued as Chairman of <gloss target="#t_USACIECA_1">USAC/IECA</gloss>.
                        I suggest we give some thought to new members of this group too; I will
                        develop a list if you wish.</p>
                    <p>2) There is a good case to be made for a friendly, aggressive approach to
                        cultural and information exchange as <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1"
                            >Marks</persName> suggests in his letter. Suggest you send the letter to
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> for their comments. With some
                        refinements, these initiatives are worth pursuing at the right time, I
                        believe.</p>
                    <p>3) Suggest you may wish to get together with <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1"
                            >John Reinhardt</persName> because I think he feels the need for support
                        and help in carrying out his responsibilities. If we accept the idea that
                        information programs are part of our national security effort, just as our
                        military and intelligence programs are, there is a good case for your
                        asserting yourself a bit in this field and not leaving it only to State,
                        which always tends to give it short shrift.</p>

                            conference.<note n="4" xml:id="d26fn4">See <ref target="#d25fn4"
                                >footnote 4, Document 25</ref>.</note> As you know from personal
                        experience during the Vietnam negotiations, the representatives of the
                        Soviet Union are skilled at discussing “the shape of the table.” In fact,
                            <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Georgi Arbatov</persName> last December made
                        such a reference in a personal conversation with me.</p>
                    <p>To foreclose this possibility a face-saving device is needed—some indication
                        from President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> that the door
                        has not been slammed in the face of Eastern Europe and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. In my opinion the solution may very
                        well lie in an expanded program of people-to-people relationships.</p>
                    <p>Recently the President referred to experiences he had had during his term as
                        Governor of Georgia with a Sister City program which had had remarkable
                            success.<note n="5" xml:id="d26fn5">See <ref target="#d7fn8">footnote 8,
                                Document 7</ref>.</note> Programs of this nature exist throughout
                        the country and have generally met with considerable enthusiasm by those who
                        participate in the United States and in foreign lands. Accordingly, I would
                        urge the following as a substantive program and as a means of showing
                        Brezhnev and others that we want to improve relationships between our
                        respective countries rather than return to a cold war atmosphere:</p>
                    <p>1. An increase in the number of Sister City relationships between the United
                        States, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union. This activity should be left
                        to private initiative, but as an inducement I would urge <pb n="65"
                            facs="0114" xml:id="pg_65"/>that a credit of $100 be given to each
                        foreign visitor from the Eastern European area coming to the United States
                        to help defray the cost of their travel. Reciprocally, the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the Eastern European countries
                        should make a similar advance to Americans visiting those countries.</p>
                    <p>In typical advertising fashion, I would introduce this program for “a limited
                        time only,” and publicize it as an effort to carry out the spirit of
                        Helsinki.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion a program of this nature should be acceptable to the Eastern
                        Europeans and to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> at this time
                        without sacrificing their stand on human rights or our alleged interference
                        in the internal affairs of their countries.</p>
                    <p>2. A dramatic increase in the number of professors and research scholars
                        invited to the United States to study in American institutions under the
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName>-<persName
                            corresp="#p_HJS_1">Hays</persName> program.<note n="6" xml:id="d26fn6"
                            >See <ref target="#d7fn5">footnote 5, Document 7</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>A reciprocal invitation from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe for
                        Americans to study in their countries.</p>
                    <p>In this connection Rector Khokhlov of Moscow State University came to the
                        United States last year to make arrangements for such an expanded program.
                        To his dismay he found that our leading universities did not have the funds
                        to undertake the exchange. Accordingly, I would recommend that financial
                        assistance be extended for this program through the Department of State.</p>
                    <p>3. I would urge the President to make a plea that there be no jamming of the
                        channel of communication, pointing out that Article 19 of the U.N.
                        Declaration of Human Rights<note n="7" xml:id="d26fn7">Adopted by the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly on December 10,
                            1948.</note> specifically provides, “Everyone has the right to freedom
                        of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions
                        without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas
                        through <hi rend="italic">any media and regardless of frontiers.”</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>4. In the same spirit, I would advocate a formal request for permission to
                        open and operate book stores in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        and Eastern Europe where American text books, literature, and cultural
                        material can be purchased. This will be characterized as an attempt to
                        “propagandize,” but should nevertheless be proposed since Basket III of the
                        Helsinki declaration specifically contemplates this type of exchange of
                            information.<note n="8" xml:id="d26fn8">See <ref target="#d13fn2"

                    <p>I hope that these ideas will receive your serious consideration. If they
                        appeal to you, I would be eager to help carry them out.</p>

                    <p>—Proceed on the basis of two assumptions: that there is substantial diversity

                        visible.</p>
                    <p>—Proceed, as much as possible, in cooperation with non-governmental

                        where necessary. CAUTION: We should avoid covert financing since it could
                        well prove counterproductive for the promotion of human rights.</p>
                    <p>—Stress the longer-term approach of promoting pluralism within various

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Law and Society:</hi> There is timeless conflict between

                        human rights derives largely from differences in value systems. A

                        political institutions could help broaden understanding of these
                        perceptions. Among possible themes for discussion: cultural values and
                        comparative legal systems, individual rights versus the “greater welfare,”
                        women in society, concepts of loyalty and obligation, individual rights
                        versus family obligations, conflict-solving through compromise versus
                        “right-or-wrong” adjudication, distributive justice, the generation gap,
                        values rooted in religion, and the role of economic enterprise and “the

                    <p>Although somewhat superficial, this is a thoughtful and very timely and
                        useful report.</p>
                    <p>The report as presented is, as it purports to be, an outline of specific
                        problems and recommendations directed to “possible improvements” (p.2) in
                        the conduct of academic exchanges under the binational commission programs
                        under the <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName>-<persName
                            corresp="#p_HJS_1">Hays</persName> Act, those administered under the
                        terms of that Act and the specific executive agreements with each of the 44
                        countries where such executive agreements are operative.</p>
                    <p>The author states: “I also take it as reasonable to assume that, after nearly
                        thirty years, this specific program in educational exchange needs
                        modification.” It would be erroneous for the reader of the report to assume
                        that it is a matter of bringing up-to-date policies and techniques initiated
                        30 years ago that have jelled without change since that time. I think that
                        most of the managers of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> recognize that
                        the world has changed considerably in the last 30 years.</p>
                    <p>Many of the problems raised are continuing ones, and a number of these have
                        from time to time been thoroughly analyzed and improvements have been made.
                        But while we talk of the country approach, which is basic, we neglect
                        disparate country-by-country requests, especially in cost factors. Thus,
                        unfortunately, special studies have been followed by later studies, and the
                        correct points are made, but then the issue is often neglected until it
                        again becomes a problem.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I believe it would be premature at this stage to seek a
                        substantial grant from a private foundation “the better to engage the
                        private sector in support of the public . . . exchange program, using the
                        grant to implement the more significant of the recommendations <pb n="71"
                            facs="0120" xml:id="pg_71"/>that follow elsewhere in this report.”
                        (p.10) What is needed first is some continuing <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss> homework on the subject, starting with a systematic analysis
                        of the specific recommendations in the <persName corresp="#p_WRW_1"
                            >Winks</persName> report vis-a-vis today’s country-by-country requests
                        versus old policies universally applied.</p>
                    <p>1. p.10: The “records, as now kept and dispersed, make it difficult to
                        provide answers to the many questions that rightly arise about future
                        government programs.”</p>
                    <p>The first step, I believe, as the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> History
                        Office has suggested with regard to the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>
                        History records, is to hire a first-rate professional archivist and a human

                        Bureau) as consultants to give us expert advice. These are matters that
                        require professional advice.</p>
                    <p>2. p.11: “Responsibility is now divided, perhaps too extensively and
                        certainly without full clarity, between too many bodies. <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_BFS_1">BFS</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_CIES_1">CIES</gloss>, the Advisory Commission, <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> through the <gloss target="#t_CAO_1"
                            >CAO</gloss>s and their country plans, binational commissions, <gloss
                            target="#t_IIE_1">IIE</gloss>, and other contract agencies. . . the
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName> program would appear
                        to be excessively expensive to administer.” The report suggests that a
                        private foundation be asked, through its own funds, to study this whole
                        problem. Before such action would merit any attention, the recommendation
                        requires careful analysis by <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> itself,
                        based on the reasons for and realities of the Department’s role in
                        CU/private, CU/legislative, and CU/BFS/binational commission relationship,
                        in the dynamics of the program.</p>
                    <p>3. pp.13–15: The discussion on these pages repeats what was written some 20
                        years ago, as the records will amply demonstrate, without indicating what
                        has been done about these matters in the intervening years and specifically
                        where improvements are needed and why. Inhibitions on progress should be
                        fully analyzed. However, if the situation appears to others the way it
                        appears to <persName corresp="#p_WRW_1">Winks</persName>, <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> should certainly clarify the picture. <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> has ample factual information and experience
                        to make a careful analysis of <persName corresp="#p_WRW_1">Winks</persName>’
                        comments, and to state clearly what has been done about these matters over
                        the years and what specifically needs new thinking now, clearly thinking
                        through the restraints that seem to dominate our thinking.</p>
                    <p>4. pp.15–17: Recommendations 9, 10, 11, and 12 are those which <persName
                            corresp="#p_WRW_1">Winks</persName> considers most innovative and
                        important among his recommendations. “I therefore see the recommendations
                        with respect to regional programming as one of the most important of those
                        offered here.” (pp.28–29) He then hastens to point out that the initiative
                        for this type of activity should come from the binational commissions
                        (p.29). Again on page 31, he remarks that <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>
                        and the <gloss target="#t_BFS_1">BFS</gloss> take the “risk” of pushing the
                        idea anyhow. Then on pages 32 and 33 cautions on the delicacy of taking
                        unilateral action, while recognizing that the program’s whole <pb n="72"
                            facs="0121" xml:id="pg_72"/>strength is its binational character (p.29).
                        The binational character of the program, a jointly administered program
                        between the U.S. and another country, the source of its binational character
                        and commitment by each of the matching countries, the U.S. and another
                        country and their educational communities, should be stated. Any regional or
                        multilateral approach should be a topic for joint binational consideration
                        unless the whole concept is in question. This point needs much deeper and
                        fully documented analysis.</p>
                    <p>5. The other recommendations, most of which touch on improving existing
                        techniques, or such matters as the adequacy of the level of grantee
                        stipends, which obviously are not the same as they were 30 years ago, should
                        each be fully reviewed and analyzed by <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>,
                        in relation to the above, before seeking outside advice. What are the
                        restraints? What are the limits, and when is outside cooperation essential?
                        There is no evidence that <persName corresp="#p_WRW_1">Winks</persName> has
                        read the many <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> reports and recommendations
                        by <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> to the <gloss target="#t_BFS_1"
                            >BFS</gloss> on this subject, and the actions taken. In any case, the
                        question of desired or possible improvements should be based on where we are
                        now in relation to country-to-country requirements, the steps taken over the
                        years, and the fact that, with regard to techniques and administrative
                        details, country-to-country requirements are more important than regional or
                        worldwide concepts of uniformity.</p>
                    <p>6. With regard to academic exchanges, <persName corresp="#p_WRW_1"
                            >Winks</persName> states: “Bi-National Commissions continue, to my mind,
                        to be the most effective means of administration abroad . . .” (p.29). If
                        so, a question that <gloss target="#t_BFS_1">BFS</gloss> might discuss at a
                        future date, but which <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> ought seriously to
                        study first, is why there have been no new Executive Agreements since 1964,
                        and what in today’s world is the meaning of “binational” in the context of
                        what we mean when we are talking specifically of the binational commission
                        programs.</p>

                        <p rend="center">March 30, 1977</p>
                        <p>I am delighted to be here for the first time. This time three months ago
                            I didn’t have the slightest idea that I would be here. Thus I have had
                            no long preparation for assuming my duties here and don’t come this
                            morning with any long list of things to be achieved. In the little over
                            two months that I have known this day was coming I obviously have been
                            doing a good deal of conferring with many of you here, with people
                            outside the building, in the public sector and the private sector. I’ve
                            been doing a good deal of reflecting on the general programs of the
                            Agency but with at least one handicap—that much of my reflection has
                            been based on an organization that I knew more closely 6–8 <pb n="75"
                                facs="0124" xml:id="pg_75"/>years ago when I was working directly in
                                it.<note n="4" xml:id="d30fn4">During the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> served as <gloss
                                    target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s Assistant Director for Africa
                                (1969–1970) and Assistant Director for East Asia and Pacific (1970)
                                prior to his 1971 appointment as U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria.</note>
                            I’m not sure that is a sound basis for proceeding. On the other hand, I
                            fear that there is a looking back on those days and as I have conferred
                            with you in the last 2½ months, many of the things that existed then are
                            still with us, for better or worse. Actually, I think to some extent,
                            for worse. This is one of the reasons that the general question of
                            reorganization, which is uppermost in everyone’s mind, is on us. I think
                            that if there had not been a <persName corresp="#p_SF_1"
                                >Stanton</persName> Panel report there would have been an “X” or “Y”
                            or “Z” report. And one of the several reasons that we are confronted
                            with the question of reorganization, which incidentally I welcome, is
                            that the Agency in its general organization, general structure, seems to
                            me has not changed essentially since its birth. And therefore the
                            question of mandate, of mission, of organization is a completely
                            legitimate one and one that I think we should welcome. I am aware that
                            those of you who have been in the Agency in Washington or overseas since
                            the appearance of the <persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName>
                            report in the spring of ’75 have had your morale affected. You have been
                            anxious, to say the least. Indeed there may have been some element of
                            fear. And I think that this is natural enough. Where does the Agency go
                            when this question is with us for a two-year period and is not
                            settled—it would do something to any organization. Thus I am determined
                            if at all possible that we put this question behind us. I told the
                            Senate Foreign Relations Committee it would take 60–90 days.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d30fn5">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1"
                                    >Reinhardt</persName>’s March 15 confirmation hearing before the
                                Senate Foreign Relations Committee; see <ref target="#d21fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 21</ref>.</note> I was not authorized to
                            say 60–90 days. I was authorized to say quickly, whatever that means. It
                            seems to me if we go along much longer with this question, it is simply
                            never settled. If a new organization cannot deal with it within a year,
                            it will tend to slide. If it slides any further, it would not be to
                            anyone’s advantage, including taxpayers. Until we know the direction in
                            which we are going, the redirection of the existing Agency will be more
                            difficult. I do not think that we should undertake any massive changes
                            until we get some better feel of the reorganization question. I
                            personally think that we do have an antiquated structure. In sheer
                            managerial terms it would seem to me there is something wrong with an
                            organization that has 17 coequal Assistant Directors or their
                            equivalents all reporting to the same place. From a sheer managerial
                            point of view this simply does not make any sense. This has nothing to
                            do with the <persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> Panel or with
                            the other 32 studies of this Agency since its beginning. I cite this as
                            just one overall structural problem that we have as an <pb n="76"
                                facs="0125" xml:id="pg_76"/>organization and that in my judgment
                            makes reorganization a fair question. I think there has been a tendency
                            over the years for us to deal with one another incestuously, to satisfy
                            ourselves whatever the outside world thinks about us, whatever the other
                            elements of the foreign affairs community may think about us. It is
                            because of this internal relationship with one another that the question
                            of the overall reorganization of the Agency has been put in abeyance,
                            has not been faced up to. We have assured ourselves that we are good
                            enough, that, e.g., when we open up a post overseas, we need a <gloss
                                target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>,
                                <gloss target="#t_IO_1">IO</gloss> and other positions, regardless
                            of whether there are indigenous information channels. This kind of
                            thinking has led to the overall question of reorganization. Whether I’m
                            right or wrong, it is on us. I think we should welcome the opportunity.
                            Once and for all, I hope to settle the question of mandate, of structure
                            of the organization, of our relationship with other elements of the
                            government and especially with other elements of the foreign affairs
                            community.</p>
                        <p>The general outline of my personal thinking on this question was
                            contained in my response to Senators at the time of my confirmation
                            hearings. I made it clear I was speaking personally. I believe Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJK_1">Javits</persName> made it crystal
                            clear.</p>
                        <p>In the time frame of the next 60–90 days, what is going to happen is that
                            in the next 2, 3 or 4 weeks at the most, I hope, the Executive will come
                            to some conclusions about what it thinks concerning reorganization.
                            There is at this time no definitive Executive position on the
                            reorganization of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. There are a
                            lot of thoughts, a lot of lobbying is going on. But no one, so far as I
                            can find out, including the President, has made up his mind. No one has
                            had argumentation on all sides of this question presented. I want to
                            tell you as much about it as I know—there are no secrets.</p>
                        <p>We know the proposals on the table—I mention the <persName
                                corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> Panel report simply because
                            that is the latest report. That report is reinforced by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJT_2">Murphy</persName> Commission report.<note n="6"

                            read it. There is no question that we have to deal with each question in
                            it. Personally I believe public diplomacy or whatever we call it is
                            important. I think that in the general foreign affairs community this
                            proposition is more or less accepted. All of us connected with the
                            Agency over the years have experienced that we were tolerated, not
                            welcomed overseas. Many foreign affairs colleagues have said, “Perhaps
                            what you’re doing is alright, but it really doesn’t have much to do with
                            what I’m doing.” I have no exact survey data, <pb n="77" facs="0126"
                                xml:id="pg_77"/>but it seems to me that in my general experience we
                            have overcome this. There is an acceptance now for many of the things we
                            do. I don’t think anyone questions the exchange of persons program, for
                            example, since we operate overseas and we’re in touch with people in the
                            foreign affairs community about this. I don’t think anyone would
                            question the existence of the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>. Many
                            people are nettled about the broadcasts, particularly when they think
                            those broadcasts encroach on their territory. Everybody recognizes the
                            need for our better print media products. My experience is that <hi
                                rend="italic">Dialogue</hi>,<note n="7" xml:id="d30fn7">Published
                                quarterly and contained reprints of articles from U.S. periodicals,
                                in addition to photographs and other images and articles written

                            Once a product is presented abroad, Ambassadors, Political Officers,
                            Administrative Officers feel this is good. So public diplomacy has come
                            to be accepted. I believe the <persName corresp="#p_SF_1"
                                >Stanton</persName> Panel did the nation a service by pointing up
                            the need. Speaking personally, I believe there should be an overall
                            body, called the Agency or whatever, that is concerned with public
                            diplomacy, meaning education, culture, etc. Fragmentation seems to be
                            the great enemy of public diplomacy. If we have a series of
                            bureaucracies around Washington each in charge of its small domain of
                            public diplomacy, this is the road to chaos. If we go that road in 5, 6,
                            8 weeks, we’ll face another move for amalgamation. This is the most
                            important part of the overall reorganization plan. Technically and
                            organizationally I don’t think it makes much difference where we end up,
                            on Pennsylvania Avenue or in the suburbs of Washington or in the
                            Department of State building. The important thing is to be a central
                            organization concerned with all of the elements of public diplomacy.
                            After all, when done well, it is an integrated effort. If the Voice is
                            broadcasting without any regard to the other elements of the public
                            diplomacy structure, if the print media or motion pictures do this, it
                            will be less good than it would be otherwise.</p>
                        <p>On this question, though, it is the uppermost thing we’re going to tackle
                            first. We’re going to try to get rid of it within 60–90 days. I cannot
                            be sure how this will be approached with Congress. Whether it is
                            presented to Congress with one or many Carter reorganization plans or
                            whether we will go before appropriate committees and discuss it at
                            length, which is what I would gather, I don’t know.</p>
                        <p>One personnel matter: <persName corresp="#p_PMTF_1">Mike
                                Pistor</persName> is back from London to work exclusively on this
                            question. He has no other function in the front office than to address
                            the question of reorganization. Many people in this Agency have had
                            their say on this subject. We have the documents, oral statements too. I
                            am perfectly willing to accept others. We think we know where you stand
                            insofar as you have written or spoken on <pb n="78" facs="0127"
                                xml:id="pg_78"/>this question. Once Mike has completed his work,
                            largely a drafting job, discussions within the Executive will begin,
                            going as high as necessary in an effort to put together a definitive
                            view of the Administration. We hope to prevail in our thinking. I think
                            I sense not indifference but lack of knowledge of this subject within
                            the foreign affairs community. Then the question is, what do we do
                            pending reorganization. Sixty to 90 days may not work. How do we
                            function? How do we bring new direction, new life, new leadership in the
                            existing structure pending reorganization? It will be difficult because
                            we do not know what we would be breathing new life into, restructuring,
                            until the question of reorganization is finally settled. With that in
                            mind, there are two or three things I would like to emphasize.</p>
                        <p>First is the question of preeminence of the field. I have heard that
                            Washington exists to support the field. I don’t know anyone who
                            particularly challenges this. To the extent that it has not worked, we
                            want to make it work. This has got to be the dominant emphasis, whether
                            we are reorganized or not. I would say that for an <gloss
                                target="#t_FSIO_1">FSIO</gloss> who wants to get ahead in the public
                            diplomacy agencies as now organized, the place to get ahead is somewhere
                            overseas, not in Washington. Literally we should consider ourselves a
                            support element. There will be an increasing need for first-class,
                            unerring support. We all accept the principle of Washington support for
                            the overseas agency. It would seem to me in my own experience that
                            despite acceptance of that principle, some of our support has been
                            lacking. I had evidence of this in the past week when going through
                            budget preparation hearings. There were hard questions and sometimes
                            less than useful answers. It would seem to me that if an element of
                            Washington bureaucracy were in charge of Africa, Personnel, whatever,
                            that element at least should know more than me about the problems and
                            know the answers. Otherwise there’s not much need for experts. I mention
                            this only as an example of what I think you will need in terms of
                            professional, expert support for the field if the field is to become or
                            remain eminent. In order to look into this question more closely, I hope
                            to work with each element here, certainly with element heads and their
                            chief subordinates. I don’t want to do this six in a day in order to get
                            rid of it. I want a briefing session from each of you from your points
                            of view but without charts, without prepared statements, but largely in
                            terms of answering questions, focusing attention on what it is that
                            concerns you in order to make your operation the most efficient. We will
                            get started in the next day or two. The main reason is not simply for my
                            education—I have some because of my long association with the Agency—but
                            to see where we are, where we stand.</p>
                        <p>I support intellectually and emotionally the general principle of
                            openness. I do not think we can make basic decisions about the Agency
                                <pb n="79" facs="0128" xml:id="pg_79"/>without considerable input
                            from various sectors of the Agency. How we structure ourselves to take
                            advantage of the climate of openness, frankly I don’t know. I am

                            reason for the establishment of this committee was to enlarge the
                            participation in the decision-making process. Insofar as I know about
                            this committee, I don’t like what I see. I don’t like the composition of
                            it. But if one tries to redesign it, I run into the problem of getting
                            an unwieldy committee. In general, the size seems satisfactory as it is.
                            But many important elements are out of it. There will be some such
                            instrument, but I do not like what we now have. I don’t promise a new
                            instrument next week, but there will be one. Pending the establishment
                            of a new one, for questions and decisions that won’t wait each element
                            should send your papers to me. If a decision has to be made immediately,
                            we will make it. This is less than open, but it seems to me all we could
                            do until we have restructured the committee. I would welcome counsel on
                            this. I don’t know whether you’re happy or unhappy with this. As we try
                            to restructure, I would welcome the counsel of each of you here and of
                            your colleagues who are not here.</p>

                            primary role as I conceive of it will be in program direction involving
                            Area offices, involving Media offices as they support programs overseas.
                            I would hope that the new Deputy, whenever he or she arrives, will focus
                            90 percent of that person’s attention on: What are we doing overseas,
                            what should we be doing, and how well are we doing it? Clearly these are
                            questions that concern the Areas primarily. They are questions that
                            concern the Media insofar as they support the Media overseas. If they
                            don’t support overseas, there is no reason for them to exist. As
                            concerns budget and administration, the only reason we budget and
                            administer is for whatever we do overseas. I hope that in the early
                            days, at least, the new Deputy will have far more business with the
                            Areas and the Media than with any other elements in the <pb n="80"
                                facs="0129" xml:id="pg_80"/>Agency. This may or may not work. It is
                            presumed the new Deputy will need staff assistants, largely for the
                            purpose of smooth liaison with the elements. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJM_1">Cynthia Fraser</persName> is already a Special
                            Assistant and will continue in that role and will be primarily concerned
                            with the smooth functioning of the office in its relationship with the
                            other elements of the Agency and to a certain extent with other elements
                            of the government. There is almost certain to be another Special
                            Assistant who will not be <persName corresp="#p_PMTF_1">Mike
                                Pistor</persName>. The other person is not there, but when we are
                            functioning there will be another Special Assistant to be carefully
                            differentiated from the work <persName corresp="#p_FJM_1">Cynthia
                                Fraser</persName> does. The second Special Assistant will be far
                            more concerned with ad hoc work: Where are the problems? Where are the
                            opportunities? This person is going to have lots of problems with the
                            bureaucracy. He/she will also concentrate on the areas of opportunities:
                            Are we missing a few bets? There will be a special project nature to the
                            function, special concentration. This person will look for the special
                            problems and opportunities.</p>
                        <p>Finally I would like to deal with an area I would call “needs,” whether
                            we’re reorganized or not. This grows out of my reflections on the
                            general operation of the Agency over the years. One of the great needs,
                            if not the greatest, hopefully can be dealt with in terms of the
                            reorganization. The need is for a meaningful, useful mandate, or
                            mission. I am well aware of the fact that many people have tried to
                            state this, and I think many are very good. I’m not sure we can improve
                            on some of the statements. Any statement of mission or mandate goes
                            right back to the Smith-Mundt Act.<note n="10" xml:id="d30fn10">See <ref
                                    target="#d1fn2">footnote 2, Document 1</ref>.</note> We have an
                            obligation to explain foreign policy, to bring the people of America
                            together with peoples abroad in an effort to gain mutual understanding.
                            There is not much question that this is the essence of the mandate. The
                            real problem is that thus far this kind of statement of the mandate has
                            also been taken as a license, much less in recent years than before. A
                            general statement allows one to do anything without any necessary
                            priorities. I am aware of Thematic Programs. I should think that these
                            do establish priorities. I think we still need a clear statement of
                            mission and of mandate that will guide us in all of our work at home or
                            abroad and that will make clear to other elements of the foreign affairs
                            community what we are up to—how public diplomacy becomes an integral
                            part of the foreign affairs structure. This should be agreed to in the
                            Congress, the foreign affairs community and in the Agency. I hope to
                            deal with this in the reorganization.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I go back again to unwieldy structure. I bring it up again only
                            because I think this is one of the needs which over all the years <pb
                                n="81" facs="0130" xml:id="pg_81"/>has cried out for some kind of
                            solution, which we still don’t have. I don’t think I can get much done
                            if 17 Assistant Directors are coming at me. There must be some more
                            efficient mechanism, whether there’s a reorganization or not.</p>
                        <p>The third need is more difficult to describe. We can write a mandate, a
                            mission, and hope for general understanding, we could reorganize the
                            structure this afternoon. But there is a need for an intellectual center
                            for the Agency in the broadest sense of the term. What have we done?
                            What has been the degree of success or failure of what we have done, and
                            what should we be doing? This center would affect the old planning,
                            guiding and evaluation problem. It has always been with us and I assume
                            it always will be with us. I don’t think I should call it a problem. It
                            is pretty easy to go our separate ways, to do our thing pretty well in
                            one area, less well in another, but without any core concern about what
                            we do as an overall Agency. This is what we need in terms of an
                            intellectual heart. Whether one person or six, this center would be
                            exclusively concerned with more imaginative, more adventuresome
                            programming that is obviously in the national interest. I hope that you
                            sense the need and I’m not quite sure how we fulfill this need.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, I think there is a crying need and always has been for a closer
                            relationship and hence greater interest in the overall foreign policy
                            process as it affects this Agency. This calls for a closer personal
                            relationship with counterparts, with other foreign affairs agencies, not
                            just the Department of State but perhaps <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss>, to a limited extent <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss>, to a more limited extent <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                                >NSC</gloss>. What we have is concerned with the overall foreign
                            policy process. I don’t think we win our spurs unless we make ourselves
                            indispensable. There has got to be a sense of our need in the foreign
                            policy process. It has been my experience that when we go to our
                            colleagues, whatever we are proposing is generally acceptable. When
                            you’re talking about culture, education, our programs, nobody is against
                            us. But what our programs do to advance foreign affairs objectives is
                            less clear. I should think that in the Area offices, for example, you
                            should be bothered by calls from the Department of State saying in
                            effect, Can you do the following things to help the general cause?
                            Whatever we’re trying to do in a country, you’ve got a role. They should
                            be calling on you as much as you call on them. I am aware that
                            personalities play a great role, perhaps preeminent role in this. I am
                            aware of the shaky relationships each of us has had with our
                            counterparts in the foreign affairs community. There has to be some
                            close relationship stemming first from personal contact but more
                            important from programs we are trying to advance. On <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and Eastern Europe, they’ve got
                            something at stake and they protect their interests. They deal closely
                            with <persName corresp="#p_SJW_1">Shirley</persName> and his
                            predecessors, <persName corresp="#p_THN_1">Tuch</persName> and his
                            predecessors because they are interested in what comes <pb n="82"
                                facs="0131" xml:id="pg_82"/>out at the other end that affects what
                            they’re intending to achieve. Frequently there are public conflicts. I
                            have seen cables from Moscow about the Voice broadcasts.<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d30fn11">For a representative example, see <ref target="#d8"
                                    >Document 8</ref>.</note> Perfectly legitimate cables. Some
                            wrong, some dead right. What we are doing so far as an Agency, the Voice
                            in this instance, is important in the foreign affairs community. I have
                            attended some <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meetings on some
                            dominant problems. There was not much question that I was there because
                            of the Voice. There was some fear that you would say something wrong.
                            But the point is that I was there largely because we had a program of
                            interest to someone, some groups outside the Agency. I can’t stress this
                            need too much. One final illustration: Before confirmation I attended a
                            briefing session by one element of the Agency trying to bring up to date
                            its counterpart element in the Department. I thought overall it was a
                            good briefing session, not so much for what we were saying as for what
                            they were asking and for the manner in which they were trying to bring
                            some harmony between our activities and theirs. The bottom line is
                            indispensability. As long as we distribute pamphlets, process leader
                            grantees, show films in a country without any general interest being
                            aroused in our colleagues, I don’t think we are making public diplomacy
                            work, not establishing a firm basis for public diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the question of the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                            problem. This is at the heart of the <persName corresp="#p_SF_1"
                                >Stanton</persName> Panel proposal and there is no question that
                            there are thorough-going, hard, tough proponents on both sides of this
                            general issue. I have given my personal opinion before the Senate and
                            the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> hierarchy. I don’t know how it
                            will turn out. As long as it is a part of the Agency, as it is now, it
                            isn’t a coequal and I don’t think it should be regarded as a coequal.
                            Some 2,500 employees and one-fourth of the Agency’s budget and the
                            ability to program overseas without going through any filtration process
                            mean that it is somewhat more important than some of the other things
                            that we do. I believe that one of the real reasons for the question of
                            the Voice as it now confronts us in the reorganization problem is that
                            over the years we have dealt with it as a coequal. Frankly, this is one
                            of the problems that we have with the <gloss target="#t_Excom_1"
                                >Excom</gloss>. How we overcome this quickly I leave to you. In some
                            of the meetings with some of the elements I have asked pretty pointed
                            questions regarding relationships with the Voice. I have not been always
                            happy with the answers. It would seem to me that radio, if it can be
                            heard in a country where we have an on-the-ground operation, becomes a
                            very important part of that operation. It needs support on the ground
                            overseas and it needs support and guidance back here. The guidance
                            question is a bothersome one and is at the heart of the <pb n="83"
                                facs="0132" xml:id="pg_83"/>organization problem. On that question
                            it would seem to me we are much better off in our relations up here if
                            we not do much before the fact, before the broadcast, about the news.
                            Good journalists must know a good story when they see it, must broadcast
                            it whatever it is. I hope with our relations with our colleagues
                            downtown that when the question of broadcasts comes up, after the fact,
                            there may very well be much discussion of what you did last week. If we
                            have this discussion about what we have done, we ought to leave news
                            alone and trust to the journalists. If we have poor journalists, we
                            ought to get good ones. There is no overall statement on this but there
                            will be one if <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> remains with us. On
                            the question of news analyses, commentaries, we have an obligation as an
                            Agency, the Voice has a mandate, a Congressionally-approved mandate, to
                            explain foreign policy. That explanation cannot be made efficiently and
                            well unless you are in contact with the policy makers. We must do
                            something to strengthen your relationship with the policy makers. It is
                            not enough each morning to have filtering down to you the policy of the
                            day. It will never be enough until there are closer relations with the
                            policy makers somehow, some way. For example, if <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> is the dominant question on a given
                            day, you clearly are going to know a great deal about this to the extent
                            that the appropriate people are able to sit down with the appropriate
                            policy makers. Policy makers have an obligation to sit down and tell us.
                            This is a key to the commentary/news analysis question. The Voice is
                            also under a mandate to reflect the diversity of opinion on these
                            questions including the subject of foreign policy. There is much debate
                            in the United States, and it is much to our advantage to reveal this. To
                            my knowledge this is generally done well. But it is a part of the uptown
                            operation to assist in the guidance toward diversity. What are the
                            suggestions? What does the research reveal on certain subjects that may
                            be of interest to the Voice as they attempt to fulfill this part of
                            their mandate?</p>
                        <p>There is a third part of the mandate, one which I call Americana. I am
                            sure there is a greater need for uptown input. I have listened to some
                            programs under this general rubric overseas that don’t seem to me to
                            have high priority, but I understood why they were there. I don’t think
                            there was any element back here focusing on what’s happening in this
                            vast and rich society of ours that may be of interest to Latins and
                            Africans and Asians. I am aware you do this down at the Voice but in a
                            structure as large as ours uptown, you ought to get better guidance on
                            this. There is a crying need for a closer relationship. The physical
                            separation does not help much. We must overcome the more important
                            intellectual separation.</p>
                        <p>On personnel assignments made en masse previously, I’m not sure we can do
                            much about them. All of them may not hold as we attempt to position
                            ourselves from a personnel point of view to achieve maximum results. But
                            probably 95 percent will remain as announced.</p>

                            as <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Leonard Marks</persName> does. He has
                            written you a somewhat more refined version of the proposals he
                            originally made in his letter of 24 March 1977 [see <ref target="#d26"
                                >Document 26</ref>]. While these proposals are not sensational, I
                            think there is a case for our making them when good opportunities arise
                            over the next few weeks and months. At any rate I would like to be sure
                            that State and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are thinking
                            constructively along these lines. One way of finding out is to send them
                            Leonard’s letter and see how they respond.” <persName corresp="#p_HPB_1"
                                >Henze</persName> also recommended that <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1"

                            (Ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName> responded to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName>’s proposals in an
                            April 6 letter, asserting: “These are worthwhile objectives and, while I
                            am not optimistic that the Soviets and some of the East European
                            countries will respond favorably to them immediately, I see advantages
                            in advancing them ‛in the spirit of Helsinki’ when good opportunities
                            present themselves over the next months.” <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> also indicated that he planned to send

                        together. This statement must be “more than words” and should call for an

                    </p>
                    <p>I am attaching a schedule (Enclosure One) describing the current Sister City
                        relationships that now exist with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                        >USSR</gloss>, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia.<note n="5" xml:id="d31fn5"

                            (and Active) Sister City Relationships.”</note> You will note that there
                        are only a limited number <pb n="85" facs="0134" xml:id="pg_85"/>of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> cities involved and that there are many
                        opportunities for expansion particularly in those communities which have
                        substantial population from the Eastern European area.</p>
                    <p>To expand this program, I would suggest that the President turn to the League
                        of Cities and the Conference of Mayors, urging them to check out
                        opportunities for inaugurating the Sister City arrangement. I have little
                        doubt that they would respond with enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>In the past arrangements for these visits were normally made by the private
                        group involved who paid their own expenses. On occasion, the Bureau of
                        Educational and Cultural Affairs (<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>) has
                        provided limited funds to encourage newly created efforts. In my opinion an
                        expansion of this program should be carried out essentially through private
                        organizations. If government plays a large role, the program loses its basic
                        appeal. Accordingly, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> should have only a
                        limited role to perform. It may be necessary to provide some funds for
                        organizational arrangements, but this would be a small amount compared to
                        the total effort.</p>
                    <p>I have recommended that a credit of $100 be given to each foreign visitor
                        from the Eastern European area coming to the United States. The mechanisms
                        for distributing these funds would not be complicated and can be arranged so
                        that the funds could be used for hotel, restaurant and other tourist
                        purposes. Most likely the Soviets would reject such assistance, but if
                        offered it can be an inducement for Eastern European groups and would make
                        the program much more attractive. However, if the $100 credit is eliminated,
                        the expanded program can still be carried out.</p>

                        At the present time, the Department of State is negotiating similar
                        agreements with Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria.</p>
                    <p>Although these governmental arrangements can be expanded, the most promising
                        area for expansion will be <hi rend="italic">direct private exchanges</hi>
                        between <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> universities and those in the
                        Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>To expand this program, I would suggest that the Department of State turn to
                        organizations such as the Association of American <pb n="86" facs="0135"
                            xml:id="pg_86"/>Universities, the International Institute of Education,
                        and similar groups which have had considerable experience in handling
                        academic exchanges. They know the rectors of universities in Eastern Europe,
                        the ministers of education, and others whose participation would be required
                        to translate this idea into a reality.</p>
                    <p>Let me point out that in the past it has been difficult to recruit qualified
                        Americans with the required language capability, and that we have not be
                        able to respond to the invitations for exchanges from important academic
                        institutions in the Eastern European area. However, I believe that this
                        problem can be overcome if we really make the effort.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Opening of Book Stores</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The United States Information Agency operates libraries and book stores
                        throughout the world. If permission should be granted by the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern European countries for
                        similar operations, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is prepared to
                        handle it. The same people who regularly provide books and services for our
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> libraries abroad can undertake
                        this assignment.</p>
                    <p>All of the proposals described above can be put into effect <hi rend="italic"
                            >without authorizing legislation</hi>, and without creating new agencies
                        of the government.</p>
                    <p>I have tried to give you a brief outline of the steps that will be required
                        to get the program started. Of course, there will be many details that will
                        require careful attention before the arrangements can be concluded. However,
                        it is important to note that none of these ideas are untried—essentially I
                        am recommending an expansion of existing programs.</p>
                    <p>The responsibility for putting these ideas into effect would be the <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> Bureau at the Department of State for the
                        Sister City programs and the <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2"

                        exchanges; and the responsibility for the book stores would be in the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The important feature of this proposal would be the accent on
                        people-to-people relationships which President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> has previously announced in discussing the Friendship
                        Force exchange.<note n="7" xml:id="d31fn7">See <ref target="#d7">Document
                                7</ref>.</note> This program is directly related to that effort and
                        would be consistent with “the spirit of Helsinki.”</p>

                        and he had told him his position would depend on man President chose.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGS_1">McGovern</persName> said he delighted at
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJA_1">Gronouski</persName>’s selection, thought
                        he extremely well qualified for job and that he would support him in every

                            >RFE/RL</gloss> boards together and making other changes to “increase

                        quite worked up and I have been on phone twice today with John Hayes about

                        it is not at all clear that legislation could pass and it certainly will not
                        pass quickly. Hayes and <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> are
                        mobilizing various people with influence on the <persName corresp="#p_HHK_1"

                        the staff members of the various committees, especially John Ritch, who

                        several weeks. Attacks began when they realized President <persName

                        into all sorts of other negative activity. They didn’t have to wait for that

                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> indicated that the
                            administration favored renewal of the Export Administration Act of 1969
                            in order to retain the Secretary of Commerce’s control of exports for
                            reasons of national security, foreign policy, and short supply. He
                            stated that the administration would, as a result of the comprehensive
                            review of U.S. nuclear export and non-proliferation policies, “develop
                            legislative recommendations” by the end of March, regarding the bills
                            designed to renew the Act. He continued: “We believe this approach would
                            have significant advantages. It would clarify U.S. nonproliferation
                            policy and provide a sound basis from which to assure U.S. leadership in
                            this field. Meanwhile, we suggest that the concerned congressional
                            committees not enact legislation in the non-proliferation area before
                            giving full consideration to the executive branch’s recommendations.”
                            (Ibid., pp. 270–271)</note> Indications are that advancing these
                        policies will make considerable demands on many of the resources of American
                        diplomacy. Public affairs, I believe, will be prominent among the resources
                        required, since a good deal of our effort will involve explaining our
                        positions in the face of hostile or indifferent receptions.</p>
                    <p>To provide proper public affairs support for U.S. nonproliferation and
                        nuclear export policies abroad, I believe that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> needs to work closely with State and the other substantive
                        agencies involved in devel<pb n="91" facs="0140" xml:id="pg_91"/>oping
                        guidance and support materials and that this cooperation should begin as
                        soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>In general terms, we envisage two sorts of support approaches. The first
                        includes materials providing guidance as well as historical and technical
                        background for use <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the President’s April 20
                        announcement. The second includes the preparation of supplementary guidance
                        and programs for follow-on support in the near and long term. We would
                        expect to use the full range of Agency resources as appropriate. These would
                        include international broadcasts over the Voice of America, speakers,
                        printed matter, press placement materials, video tape recordings and motion
                        pictures. Specific materials would be differentiated for use by general or
                        highly specialized audiences as needs require.</p>
                    <p>If you agree that this sort of cooperation could usefully contribute to the
                        support of the U.S. nonproliferation and nuclear export policies, I suggest
                        that your staff and mine get together as soon as possible to plan and
                        develop a systematic program of public affairs support.</p>
                    <p>Since time is of the essence, I look forward to your early response to this
                        proposal.</p>

                    <p>We have read with interest <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Leonard
                            Marks</persName>’ letter of March 31, 1977, and share his view that we
                        should continue to look for ways to expand contacts with the Soviet Union
                        and the countries of Eastern Europe. We agree that it would be useful for
                        the United States to spell <pb n="92" facs="0141" xml:id="pg_92"/>out ideas
                        on this subject at a suitable level and at the right political moment.</p>
                    <p>Of the three specific suggestions in the letter, two relate to State/<gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>; however, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> would be responsible for implementing all three in the
                        field.</p>
                    <p>—Sister City exchanges are useful, but we do not ascribe to them a
                        particularly high priority. We agree that they are best handled through
                        private channels with appropriate government consultation and facilitative
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>—We concur that direct private exchanges should be encouraged. To a
                        considerable extent, our officers in Eastern Europe already play an active
                        catalytic role in bringing local and American institutions together. Since
                        private exchanges in Communist countries go through government channels,

                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> does not directly operate book
                        stores. In some cases, we have indirectly been involved in book sales,
                        particularly through binational centers in Latin America. There exist legal
                        and other impediments to government operation of book stores, but such
                        obstacles could probably be overcome if the opportunities offered merited
                        the effort. We understand that the Department, after exploratory talks with
                        our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies, has decided not to raise
                        the subject of book stores at the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"

                        <p>In the longer range we can provide to elites abroad, through the wide

                            context in which foreign policies are made and the purposes they serve
                            of mutual interest to other countries. As you know from your own
                            experience, American experts are sent by the Department of State and
                            ourselves through our posts to talk directly with their foreign
                            colleagues. Where U.S. officials are not able to travel abroad for this
                                <pb n="96" facs="0145" xml:id="pg_96"/>purpose, we can arrange a
                            special “electronic dialogue” with key foreign audiences through an
                            advance videotaped statement by the official followed by a
                            radio-telephonic Q and A discussion. For example, <persName

                            such a dialogue with Japanese leaders on Law of the Sea issues in the
                            near future. In any case, we regularly videotape discussions and
                            interviews with government officials or experts on timely subjects for
                            showing to strategically placed invited audiences or for placement on

                            toward the United States so that our public affairs officers often are
                            invaluable advisors to our embassies on public opinion factors. In
                            addition, in many countries we are able to contract for public opinion
                            polls on current issues of concern to the U.S., enabling us to provide
                            the Executive Branch with unique information which may vary
                            significantly from what we hear from official sources and editorialists.

                        not the most important part of the Agency’s efforts and in my view we would
                        not be terminally disadvantaged were we to be denied this source of

                        implementation of public diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>I would like to take advantage of your invitation to suggest ways in which
                        our activities might relate more effectively to those of other elements
                        within <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, to new developments within
                            <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> that have changed its operating
                        style significantly, and some suggestions for other innovations within
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> structures that could be useful
                        to <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> and, we believe, to other Agency
                        elements as well.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. THE ROLE OF <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>It need hardly be argued that the channel of communication represented by
                        films, broadcast and closed circuit television represents one of our most
                        significant means of approaching foreign audiences. No one can seriously
                        argue that we can do an effective job as an Agency without well-developed
                        capabilities in these media. No one would seriously argue that our media can
                        do the job alone.</p>
                    <p>As will be described below, <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> activities
                        have become increasingly drawn into close conformity with those of other
                        elements, particularly with those of the field posts. That this has been
                        realized has resulted from the efforts of many individuals, most of them
                        within <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> itself. By stating this fact so
                        bluntly, we do not wish to claim any undue credit for ourselves or to
                        overlook the contributions of others. We mean only to dramatize a condition
                        that you have already recognized and commented upon: that the Agency lacks a
                        vital intellectual center, a program heart in which the activities of its
                        various elements are fully orchestrated. <gloss target="#t_IOP_1"
                            >IOP</gloss> has made a laudable effort to collect information on field
                        program plans and to bring elements together to coordinate responses to
                        these requests. But in practice these meetings have provided only the most
                        general guidance for <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss>, and real
                        production planning has been the result of bilateral contacts between <gloss
                            target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> and the posts rather than the multilateral
                        orchestration that is still lacking.</p>
                    <p>If, as you indicated on March 30, we are headed toward a more centralized
                        effort at coordinating program planning, <gloss target="#t_IMV_1"
                            >IMV</gloss> can be counted on to support those efforts fully. We hope,
                        however, that any such effort will distinguish carefully between the
                        requirements of program direction and program implementation. Neither <gloss
                            target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> nor any other supporting service of the
                        Agency should claim a right to determine its own program goals. Those should
                        be set at the highest level of the Agency. We do, however, want to continue
                        to be able to make available to the Agency and to the achievement of its
                        objectives our own collective professional experience with our medium—to be
                        able to have a leading voice in determining when a film is needed or when
                            <pb n="103" facs="0152" xml:id="pg_103"/>our contribution is better made
                        by a <gloss target="#t_VTR_1">VTR</gloss>; when a project calls for
                        cooperation with a foreign <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> station rather
                        than be undertaken by the Agency alone; when a subject is fit for
                        audio-visual treatment, or when it is best left to the print or other media.
                        And we want to continue to be a source of ideas for programming
                        innovation.</p>
                    <p>These are not minor questions. In fact, they are the source of much of the
                        continuing and, perhaps, unavoidable friction between the consuming and
                        producing elements of the Agency—the friction that arises when those who are
                        specialists in a program area suspect that “technicians” are attempting to
                        frustrate their program purposes and when those who are specialists in a
                        creative medium fear that “dilettantes” are trying to impose their personal
                        tastes and judgment on production decisions.</p>
                    <p>In our view, the greatest single need faced by this Agency is breaking down
                        this mutual suspicion. We have had the stimulating experience of working
                        closely with individual posts, Areas and other elements on tangible
                        cooperative undertakings where each recognized and welcomed the contribution
                        of the other. If the Agency is to function as a unified, effective whole,
                        these experiences must be made general. They must become the rule, rather
                        than the exception.</p>

                            >IMV</gloss> OPERATIONS</p>
                    <p>A number of significant changes have affected <gloss target="#t_IMV_1"
                            >IMV</gloss> operations in recent years which, we believe, should be
                        kept in mind when and if a changed relationship of this element to the rest
                        of the Agency is considered.</p>

                    <p>During recent years, <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> has made a
                        concerted effort to improve performance in support of field activities. We
                        have recognized that USIA/USIS represents a global communication system and
                        that all team members must be mutually supportive toward the accomplishment
                        of perceived Agency objectives. <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss>
                        recently designed, coordinated and implemented a very substantial
                        reorganization of personnel and functional alignments specifically to
                        enhance the quality and delivery of services to the field, to provide better
                        liaison with areas and to infuse professional foreign service experience and
                        guidance throughout key areas of <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss>
                        affecting responsiveness to field requirements.</p>
                    <p>We have sought to draw all of our activities more closely into the framework
                        of post programs and into the interest range of post audiences. The efforts
                        include:</p>
                    <p>1. Preserving, against a growing tide of production requests coming from
                        other elements of the Agency and from other governmental departments, a
                        capacity to respond to direct post requests for <gloss target="#t_VTR_1"
                            >VTRs</gloss>, <pb n="104" facs="0153" xml:id="pg_104"/>news coverage
                        support and, more recently, even one-country films. We have done this by
                        setting aside a quota of VTRs that will be reserved for the posts, so that
                        our work in support of <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_IPT_1">IPT</gloss>, the Department of Commerce and others
                        does not crowd out our first objective—providing audio-visual support for
                        post programs as expressed in direct requests from the posts themselves.</p>
                    <p>2. Pioneering, with <gloss target="#t_IOA_1">IOA</gloss>, an effort to
                        obtain, in manageable form, regular reports of usage and assessment of
                            <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> products, in an effort to judge our
                        output by its utility to the field. We will seek the endorsement of the
                        Director, in a separate paper,<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">Not found and not
                            further identified.</note> of this program, so that these purposes may
                        be achieved.</p>
                    <p>3. We have held program review meetings with all individual areas, involving
                        Area Directors, their deputies and staffs, with our own senior and operating
                        staff, to discuss and refine our support for Area and post programs. These
                        meetings have been mutually enlightening.</p>
                    <p>4. We have invited visiting <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s to <gloss
                            target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> to discuss our programs and their
                        problems, and have exposed members of our staff who had rarely had the
                        opportunity in the past to the presentation by a <gloss target="#t_PAO_1"
                            >PAO</gloss> of his problems, media evaluation, and other operating
                        realities.</p>
                    <p>5. We have undertaken a new effort to work very closely with the Inspection
                        Staff, alerting them to current projects at posts on the inspection
                        schedule, and giving them questions we want answered about our effectiveness
                        and usefulness to the post. We meet following each inspection as well, and
                        have found these procedures particularly useful in promoting interchange
                        between ourselves and the posts.</p>
                    <p>6. We have sent <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> representatives to help
                        the posts in both technical and programming projects, and have tried to
                        ensure that any overseas travel by members of the <gloss target="#t_IMV_1"
                            >IMV</gloss> staff is planned on a project basis, so that it yields
                        concrete program development information.</p>

                    <p>The recent increase in the value of audio-visual products in policy support
                        derives from the observation that a lop-sided amount of past film and <gloss

                    <p>2. In a related effort, we have developed, with <gloss target="#t_IOP_1"

                    </p>
                    <p>3. Potentially our most far-reaching effort has been the establishment of a
                        category of films called <hi rend="italic">Special Report</hi>, in which we
                        are attempting to involve policy directors in related agencies to join with
                        us in defining, on film, the essential ingredients in a current U.S. policy
                        objective. Our first attempt in this format has just been completed. The
                        film <hi rend="italic">Toward A Law of the Sea</hi> was developed, scripted,
                        and reviewed by a joint team of <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Task Force officers. It received a
                        final review at a special screening held in Geneva for Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_REL_1">Richardson</persName>, who appears in the film which
                        is now on its way to posts in English, Spanish, French, Arabic and
                        Portuguese. Production time from contract to shipment was approximately nine
                        weeks. Using the Law of the Sea film as a working example of what can be
                        done in this regard, we have held a screening at the State Department for
                        representatives from the Department, <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss> who are work<pb n="106"

                        have proposed to them a formation of a working group to develop a concept
                        paper for a <hi rend="italic">Special Report</hi> on non-proliferation, and
                        will work closely with this group on the successful completion of the
                        product once the concept has been approved by the agencies concerned. We
                        have in mind the development, in this mode, of greater appreciation on the
                        part of policy shapers of the role that a carefully crafted film may play in
                        the overall orchestration of efforts to explain and gain support for current
                        U.S. policy objectives.</p>

                        <hi rend="roman">C.</hi> Specialized Audience Requirements</p>
                    <p>A further significant characteristic of current <gloss target="#t_IMV_1"
                            >IMV</gloss> output deserves special mention—the extent to which the
                        collection now includes material suitable for presentation to carefully
                        selected professional and intellectual audiences. Although <gloss
                            target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> still considers television and theatrical
                        exposure of our products to mass audiences an important and useful part of
                        its function, it also gives high priority to provide posts material suitable
                        for exposure to primary audiences.</p>
                    <p>The new emphasis on <gloss target="#t_VTR_1">VTR</gloss> has, to a great
                        extent, fulfilled this need with its versatility, comparatively low cost,
                        and suitability for a precise matching of participants to audiences. The
                        “expert to expert” mode is used often and well by posts in all areas.</p>
                    <p>But there is no avoiding the realization that film is of great interest to
                        even the most elite of audiences, and the Agency will deprive itself of
                        important access to these groups if it cannot develop material on film
                        worthy of their attention. We have sought to do so in a variety of ways.</p>
                    <p>Probably our most conscious effort to reach elite audiences is in <hi
                            rend="italic">Reflections</hi>, a new series of hour-long films in which
                        Americans of eminence and achievement are asked to sum up their lives and
                        works through the device of an illustrated monologue. Two productions have
                        been completed in this series, <hi rend="italic">

                        </hi>. Once a number of these films has been completed on a representative
                        collection of outstanding American scholars, writers, humanists and
                        statesmen, we foresee that they may form the basis of an American studies
                        program at a Center or a University. To insure maximum usefulness, we also
                        plan to produce half-hour versions of these films to enhance their use with
                        a broader range of audiences and, in some countries, on television. We have
                        supplied small <pb n="107" facs="0156" xml:id="pg_107"/>brochures, including
                        selected bibliographies with the <persName corresp="#p_MM_1">Mead</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_MSE_1">Morison</persName> films, and intend to
                        continue the practice.</p>
                    <p>Our <hi rend="italic">Century 3</hi> series, although addressed to a broader
                        audience than <hi rend="italic">Reflections</hi>, also reflects our
                        determination to supply posts with films they can present not only to
                        television stations, but in direct projection to invited primary audiences.
                        It is a thoughtful examination of the ways in which science and technology
                        are likely to affect our lives over the next century—our food supply, our
                        cities, even our concepts of life and death. Our productions in the arts—<hi
                            rend="italic">Nik: An Experience in Sight and Sound</hi>, with the
                        Nikolais Dance Group, <hi rend="italic">Jose Limon</hi>, and our two-part
                        examination of the accomplishment of black artists in America for use in
                        Afro-American history programs—<hi rend="italic">The Legacy</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">The Inheritors</hi>—also demonstrate a conscious effort to
                        reach our key audiences on the terms of their special interests.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we have greatly expanded and improved our acquired film program in
                        recent years and, through its activities, have been able to bring into the
                        program some of the finest documentary and dramatic works being produced in
                        America today. We expect <persName corresp="#p_WD_1">David

                    <p>It can no longer be said that the Voice of America differs from other
                        elements of the Agency in that it alone can directly address foreign
                        audiences through its own communications network. Although <gloss
                            target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss>-originated satellite telecasts use foreign
                        networks for the last few kilometers in the delivery chain, many networks
                        have carried our <pb n="108" facs="0157" xml:id="pg_108"/>material live and
                        unedited, so as to make the recent experience of <gloss target="#t_IMV_1"
                            >IMV</gloss> comparable to that of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>.
                        Furthermore, although we intend no invidious comparisons, even our
                        colleagues at the Voice may acknowledge that our exposure to a foreign
                        national audience watching its own national network is far greater, when it
                        occurs, than the exposure <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> anticipates
                        in most parts of the world. Such was the case recently when six Latin

                        Such was also the case with many of the 17 networks which carried our
                        special inaugural satellite feeds in January, or the Bicentennial feeds to

                        use ever made of videotapes was the result of our decision to offer the

                        airline vice-presidents, and by any other means developed by the ingenuity
                        of the posts and our operations staff, more than 100 copies of each debate
                        were sent out. Some arrived and were shown at European posts the morning
                        after the debate occurred. Posts reported that the <gloss target="#t_VTR_1"

                    <p>The U.S. Government does not have so many internationally trained multi-media
                        communicators that it can afford to permit its operations to remain
                        fragmented and non-coordinated, especially in program design and planning
                        areas. Whatever goes to overseas audiences from any source affects the image
                        of America in the public diplomacy environment. The government’s information
                        outreach where it affects foreign policy, overseas attitudes or the
                        elimination of distorted views of U.S. purposes should be brought into a
                        cohesive, modernized and more effective system.</p>

                        relationship to the public diplomacy mission but usually the agency
                        requesting assistance is not aware of how best to solve an important
                        communication problem.</p>
                    <p>The most dramatic case in point was <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s
                        approach to us for assistance in carrying out a multi-million dollar effort
                        to demonstrate the use of high-technology communications in development.
                        During the period in which the <gloss target="#t_ATS6_1">ATS–6</gloss>
                        satellite was being moved from its stationary orbit over India, where it had

                            >NASA</gloss>. We were of decisive assistance in shaping the content of
                        these programs, but we had to stand off at some distance because of
                        distinctions between our mission and <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                        >AID</gloss>’s.</p>
                    <p>One consequence of the experience was our own feeling that it might be time
                        to re-think somewhat the absolute taboo on “nation-building” the Agency has
                        lived with for some time. Our own operations are a powerful stimulus to
                        technology transfer, with the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                        demonstration the most dramatic such illustration. But even post <gloss
                            target="#t_VTR_1">VTR</gloss> operations have stimulated host nations to
                        begin their own. Is it taboo for us to encourage institutions we work with
                        abroad, universities and governments, to develop closed-circuit operations
                        compatible with our own so that we can lend them videotape software? Is it
                        possible for us to be too squeamish in circumstances where helping a host
                        government provides new opportunities for the use of new technology to
                        encourage new forms of dialogue?</p>

                    <p>If the Agency is to have a true “intellectual center,” it must also have a
                        more comprehensive system of reporting than has ever existed, and a more
                        modern means of storing, analyzing and making that information available to
                        all who need it. We have already made note of our own efforts in cooperation
                        with <gloss target="#t_IOA_1">IOA</gloss> to develop usage reports on <gloss
                            target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> products. Obviously, we will continue to
                        fall short of true professionalism until we have a comprehensive picture of
                        what happens in the field to the flow of products from Washington. We
                        believe this can be done without increasing field paperwork. In fact, by
                        using modern data reporting systems, paperwork can be simplified. Our own
                        data cards have replaced a cumbersome and time-consuming film report.</p>
                    <p>Program usage, media data and other information relevant to inter-cultural
                        communications should be managed in a central part of the Agency, staffed by
                        career professionals, some of whom would provide critical continuity and
                        serve as an information resource to those who direct programs.</p>

                    <p>I agree completely with your point on the need to provide proper public

                        consistent with the delicate “negotiations” that will ensue with concerned
                        congressional committees which have introduced their own non-proliferation
                        bills.</p>
                    <p>On the general subject of U.S. Nuclear Power Policy, you are, of course,
                        aware of the President’s April 7 statement,<note n="4" xml:id="d40fn4">On
                            April 7, during a question and answer session held in the Briefing Room
                            at the White House, the President announced that the administration had
                            engaged in a review of issues related to the use of nuclear power; as a
                            result of that review, the administration would pursue a major change in
                            U.S. domestic nuclear energy policies, designed to limit the production
                            of plutonium, encourage research into alternative nuclear fuel cycles,
                            increase production capacity for enriched uranium, and continue
                            discussions with a number of governments over the establishment of an
                            international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation program. (<hi rend="italic"

                            House also released a statement on nuclear power policy, containing

                        in public fora, we would then have to decide on the desirability of using
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> resources in support of the new
                        policies. Obviously, this will require an evaluation of the political risks
                        of such a public affairs campaign in the context of the sensitive
                        consultations we will be conducting with our nuclear trading partners—many
                        of whom will not be enthusiastic with some of our non-proliferation
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>We will monitor the situation closely over the weeks ahead and keep your
                        staff informed as Presidential decisions emerge and the desirability of a
                        public affairs program to support them becomes clearer.</p>

                        on February 18, 1977, with the Canadian Secretary of State for External

                            Roberts</persName> and their colleagues who deal with international
                        educational and cultural matters.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of our meeting was to examine ways in which educational and
                        cultural exchange can better contribute to mutual understanding between our
                        two countries, and to consider constructively any problems which may stand
                        in the way of this goal. We reviewed existing programs for the exchange of
                        students, professors and performing arts groups; Canadian and American
                        patterns of education; cultural matters of mutual concern, such as the
                        importation of books, magazines, films and television programs; and
                        multilateral questions like the Helsinki agreement, the activities of <gloss
                            target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> and the formation of a United
                        Nations University, in which both countries have an interest. Our discussion
                        touched specifically upon recent Canadian legislation affecting
                        international exchange and on the relationship between both governmental and
                        private groups engaged in the field. The Commission’s principal observations
                        stemming from examination of these subjects are outlined in the following
                        paragraphs.</p>
                    <p>1. Although close political, economic and social ties exist between Canada
                        and the United States, there are nevertheless differences between Americans
                        and Canadians. These stem largely from our differing historical, economic
                        and social backgrounds; and they have led to contemporary differences in
                        political structures and attitudes, in cultural aspirations and
                        opportunities. Far from deploring their differences from Americans,
                        Canadians cherish them and wish to maintain them, for they provide Canada
                        with a specific Canadian identity, which it is eager to retain in the face
                        of the enormous penetration of their country by ideas, attitudes and
                        artifacts from the United States. Our Commission believes it is important to
                        continued good relations, between our two countries that Americans
                        understand this Canadian attitude.</p>
                    <p>2. Great care must be exercised on both sides of the border to make sure that
                        the Canadian Government’s legitimate aspiration to provide “a Canadian
                        choice” for its people in the selection of cultural products, and the
                        American Government’s legitimate desire to provide the widest possible
                        market for its cultural products, do not lead to recriminatory or
                        discriminatory legislation which is damaging to Canadian-American
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Our Commission quite understands why the Canadian Government has taken steps
                        to regulate the flow of cultural materials from <pb n="115" facs="0164"
                            xml:id="pg_115"/>the United States and appreciates Canadian efforts to
                        stimulate the creative energies of its own people. At the same time it
                        questions whether these measures will produce the desired result. It is a
                        fact of international life that competition exists in the distribution of
                        cultural as well as other products; and experience has shown that the
                        quality of the product rather than the nationality of the producer
                        determines its acceptance in the foreign market. The success in the United
                        States of such Canadian artists as Saul Bellow and Robert Goulet, and of
                        such products as the film “The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz,”<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d41fn3">Reference is to the 1974 film, directed by Ted Kotcheff,
                            starring Richard Dreyfuss and Randy Quaid. The film is based on the 1959
                            novel, of the same name, written by Mordecai Richler.</note> are cases
                        in point.</p>
                    <p>The Commission further believes that Canada profits from its close proximity
                        to the United States, in that the United States pays developmental costs for
                        encyclopedias, reference books, television programs, musical and dance
                        productions and the like, and makes them available to Canadians at
                        reasonable cost. The Commission believes it would be unfortunate for both
                        sides if these transactions were inhibited.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the Commission favors unfettered international educational and
                        cultural exchange, and is therefore opposed in principle to any measures, at
                        home or abroad, which restrict it. Thus while it regrets Canadian
                        legislation to limit in Canada the sale of American products, the
                        performance of American artists, the viewing of U.S. television programs, or
                        the advertising of American products in Canadian periodicals, it understands
                        the philosophical principles behind the legislation and does not recommend
                        that the United States adopt similar measures which would restrict the
                        importation of Canadian cultural and educational materials.</p>
                    <p>What the Commission does recommend is a continuation of a calm, frank
                        approach by both countries to a resolution of problems which arise. Neither
                        side need abandon the philosophical, commercial or cultural principles which
                        it espouses. Candid discussion and a spirited defense of each country’s
                        perceived self-interest can, we believe, lead to a realistic settlement of
                        these issues.</p>
                    <p>3. In spite of the large volume of private exchanges between Canada and the
                        United States, an official U.S. program is desirable. In fact, given the
                        importance of the U.S.-Canadian relationship, the Commission recommends that
                        consideration be given to increasing the State Department’s budget for
                        exchanges, particularly with a view to making possible more grants to
                        Canadians under the Department’s International Visitor Program.</p>
                    <pb n="116" facs="0165" xml:id="pg_116"/>
                    <p>4. Our final observation, though very general, is perhaps the most
                        significant of all. It is that, in spite of the enormous possibilities for
                        misunderstanding which exist between two such close—yet such
                        different—neighbors, Canadians and Americans agree on basic principles and
                        values and are striving intelligently to resolve their differences.</p>
                    <p>The Commission commends recent efforts of the Canadian Government to make its
                        country better known in the United States. It is reassured by the statements
                        of its leaders that their efforts to provide a “Canadian choice” for
                        Canadians do not represent a denial of the principle of free flow of
                        information nor any discrimination against the United States. It is
                        encouraged by growing evidence that Americans are developing a sympathetic
                        appreciation of Canada’s desire to retain its own national identity. It is
                        convinced that the maintenance of good relations between Canada and the
                        United States is a top priority for the Canadian Government, as it is for
                        the American Government, and that educational and cultural exchange can
                        promote the mutual understanding both countries desire.</p>
                    <p>The Commission hopes that its exchange of views with Canadian officials has
                        made a contribution to this goal. Detailed Minutes of Commission’s meetings
                        in Ottawa have been prepared and will be submitted to the Congress and the
                        State Department in accordance with the provisions of Section 107 of the
                        Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961.<note n="4"

                        <persName corresp="#p_IKF_1">Rick Inderfurth</persName> has asked me to
                        provide you with some pros and cons on a <gloss target="#t_PRM_1"
                            >PRM</gloss> on information programs directed abroad.</p>
                    <p>The basic argument for a <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRM</gloss> is that since
                        the U.S. Government has many programs, it would be useful to assess how
                        effective they are and how they complement each other, if they do.</p>
                    <p>Another argument for a <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRM</gloss> is to assess
                        trends and requirements and see what we need to be prepared for in the
                        future. This impinges upon <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRM</gloss>–10.<note

                    <p>Another useful aspect of such an exercise would be to add up what responsible
                        people think ought to be done and then see how much of it is actually being
                        done and how well.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is the question of method of implementation: are our methods
                        and instruments effective? Are we spending our money in the most productive
                        way? Are we taking account of likely future developments in technology? Are
                        we encouraging research on impact of our programs and feeding the results
                        back into our programs and plans?</p>

                    <p>On the other hand, there are arguments against one. We have a great many
                            <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRMs</gloss> under way now on broad issues.
                        From the point of view of our own workload, it may be too soon to add
                        another major exercise to the list.</p>
                    <p>The various agencies who would be involved have not yet staffed or
                        reorganized themselves fully—<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>,

                    <p>There are no pressing problems in this area that require urgent solution.</p>

                    <p>The government is responsible for only a small part of the impact which the
                        United States makes on foreign audiences: the role of the press, radio and
                            <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> networks, the American book and
                        magazine publishing industry and the enormous and varied information and
                        public relations efforts, educational exchange programs and person-to-person
                        arrangements sponsored by industry, foundations and universities are more
                        important than governmental efforts.</p>
                    <p>Only certain aspects of the issue are amenable to <gloss target="#t_PRM_1"

                        could become an unwieldy, sprawling undertaking that might not be very
                        helpful to anyone and would take up time and effort that operating agencies
                        could more usefully be expending in other ways.</p>
                    <p>There are certain philosophical issues: To what extent should or can the U.S.
                        Government attempt to coordinate and guide private effort? How comprehensive
                        should U.S. Government programs aim to be? What is most important—mass
                        impact or influencing of selected audiences? Is a worldwide information
                        policy feasible or desirable? How important is it to have a consciously
                        orchestrated U.S. Government information effort abroad when the day-by-day,
                        routine impact of everything we do and say on much of the world is already
                        so enormous?</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">RECOMMENDATION</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>If, in the near future, priority issues in this field emerge, I recommend we
                        issue a <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRM</gloss> confined to a separate issue. I
                        suggest we defer a general <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRM</gloss> until the
                        end of summer, at the earliest, and then design one very carefully in light
                        of <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff experience with other broad
                            <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRMs</gloss> currently in progress. Meanwhile,
                        I suggest we take measures soon to ensure that U.S. Government positions and
                        tactics for the forthcoming Belgrade meeting<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">See
                                <ref target="#d25fn4">footnote 4, Document 25</ref>.</note> and
                        subsequent events are carefully worked out. We can expect a vigorous,
                        polemic, aggressively defensive approach by the Soviets to Belgrade. More
                        important, however, than elaborate policy papers, is selection of a good
                        delegation that can stand on its own feet in Belgrade and meet Soviet
                        initiatives with flexibility and imagination. The basic elements of the
                        situation are all in our favor but we have to assert ourselves to take
                        advantage of them.</p>

                        ionospheric propagation conditions. Developments are taking place so rapidly

                        and documents. The increasingly high power of communications satellites is
                        making it possible to communicate directly via them to and from simple,
                        low-cost ground stations which can be housed in an embassy communications
                        room, eliminating ground links. The actual cost of communications should no
                        longer be a function of distance.</p>

                        already used by State and is examining electronic means of copy preparation
                        and printing. <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> makes occasional use of

                        studying various data retrieval systems. And there may be other plans of
                        which I am not aware.</p>
                    <p>But these efforts are individual and uncoordinated. None of them is part of
                        an overall Agency effort to explore how we could most reliably and most
                        cheaply establish the basic circuits between Washington and our
                        establishments overseas which could carry all these communications—and much
                        more. No single office or individual in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> has the responsibility for the major initiatives that will
                        be required if we are to take maximum advantage of recent breakthroughs in
                        communications technology and avoid being outmoded by it. Agency elements
                        are proceeding independently to poke and prod at various parts of the
                        communications elephant, and naturally drawing different conclusions.</p>
                    <p>If this new technology is to be practical for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> use it must be cost-effective. We cannot save money by
                        adding to existing systems. We must be able to give up the old in order to
                        pay for the new. We <pb n="122" facs="0171" xml:id="pg_122"/>should not
                        operate high power broadcast transmitter complexes in the U.S. to service
                        overseas relay stations when their functions could be taken over by much
                        smaller sideband transmitters or satellite circuits. We might reduce our
                        great rental expense by reducing the size of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> library reference sections in favor of servicing by data
                        banks in Washington. Secure two-way conference calls could substitute for
                        much of our present costly overseas travel. Air pouch costs could be slashed
                        by providing posts and relay stations with high quality audio-visual
                        materials and correspondence by videodisc<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">One

                        believe that we could make a convincing case to <gloss target="#t_OMB_1"
                            >OMB</gloss> and Congressional committees that judicious capital
                        expenditures now would save funds later, or at least prevent costs from
                        escalating at their present ruinous rate.</p>
                    <p>None of this is pie in the sky. The technology already exists and some of it
                        already is being used. Last December a front page of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Washington Post</hi> was transmitted to Rome to demonstrate the
                        feasibility of communications satellites for high-speed, overseas
                        distribution of reproduction-quality proofs to printing plants far removed
                        from the editorial office and composing room here. The <hi rend="italic"
                            >Wall Street Journal</hi> has used such a system domestically for over a
                        year to link two of its satellite printing plants to its editors and has two
                        more going on stream. By 1980 Satellite Business Systems will be
                        interconnecting customers from Alaska to Puerto Rico, using their own
                        on-premises earth stations not only to replace existing voice and low-speed
                        data circuits but also to provide intracompany mail services, extremely high
                        speed data transfers, and teleconferences whose participants will see each
                        other as they talk. Facsimile already is cutting so significantly into U.S.
                        first class mail volumes that it is the subject of serious concern of the
                        House postal operations and services subcommittee.</p>
                    <p>Time is an important element. Planning and policy decisions are being made
                        which may foreclose some of our options. Over a year has passed since a task
                        force recommended that the Agency immediately examine new possibilities for
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> transmissions, pointing to an
                        increase in engineering costs which even then was threatening not only the
                        Agency’s overall budget but the Voice’s own program resources. A <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> reorganization that separated <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> would remove the possibility of using the
                        same technology to service both our radio and other Agency operations.</p>
                    <p>A variety of means exist or could be established to provide the circuits we
                        would need. Commercial satellite circuits of course already <pb n="123"
                            facs="0172" xml:id="pg_123"/>exist and are used. These are relatively
                        costly and their ground links in foreign countries are not under our
                        control. It would be wise to at least attempt to negotiate for permission to
                        operate our own receivers abroad. A major cost saving could come if the
                        Agency were able to utilize completely U.S. Government-owned facilities.
                        However, a major policy roadblock exists in the form of a group of rulings
                        by the <gloss target="#t_FCC_1">FCC</gloss>, opinions of the <gloss
                            target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> and Office of Telecommunications Policy
                        which promote the use of commercial carriers. So far, only the military, and
                        to some extent <gloss target="#t_NASA_1">NASA</gloss>, have succeeded in
                        obtaining relief. However, these rulings are not immutable. Other agencies
                        of the Federal Government with extensive overseas communications
                        requirements have a stake in undertaking the determined and sustained effort
                        that would be necessary to change the situation. There already are
                        indications of a desire for modification. <persName corresp="#p_WAM_1"
                            >Abbott Washburn</persName>, for instance, has insisted that the <gloss
                            target="#t_FCC_1">FCC</gloss> review its 1966 ruling on the subject.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the Agency seems to be doing nothing while the Department of
                        Defense prepares to launch its second generation Defense Communications
                        Satellites (DSCS.II) beginning in October and plans the configuration of its
                        third series for use in the early 1980s. This year also will see the launch

                            >FltSatCom</gloss> system, which will further add to <gloss

                        have for some time been working out the policy problems of their Skylink
                        system. The House Interstate Foreign Commerce communications subcommittee
                        and its Senate counterpart are holding hearings which may lead to a complete
                        revision of the Federal Communications Act.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4"

                        interests are protected and advanced in that forum. The U.S. position in the
                        January 1979 World Administrative Radio Conference which may prove crucial
                        to the future of international broadcasting is being established without
                        top-level Agency attention.</p>
                    <p>You already are or soon will be receiving requests for new equipment from
                        various parts of the Agency. These requests will be based on the parochial
                        needs of the elements concerned. In many cases these needs will have been
                        determined in purely technical terms, without regard to broad Agency
                        requirements and in some instances without even a complete knowledge of the
                        full range of technical developments either in being or imminent. I have a
                        vivid memory of the strong assurances given to us by engineers only a little
                        more than a year ago that the direct satellite broadcast of television to
                        home receivers would be impossible for at least a decade. One of the

                            corresp="#p_LPJ_1">Lopez Portillo</persName> administration are
                        excellent at this point, leaving opportunity for vastly expanded cooperation
                        in exchanges with a country of great importance to U.S. Given economic and
                        commercial ties, a common border and a growing Spanish-speaking population
                        in the U.S. (largely of Mexican origin), areas of confluent interest abound
                        and should be supported by increased official interaction through carefully
                        planned exchange of persons. One example of <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                            >GOM</gloss> interest is acceptance of invitation to visit U.S. under
                        Department auspices by Education Minister <persName corresp="#p_MLP_1"
                            >Porfirio Munoz Ledo</persName> in September. He wishes discuss mutual
                        areas of interest and concern, thus giving <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss> unprecedented opportunity to enhance relations between us
                        in educational and cultural fields. Another potential forum for improving
                        relations will be bilateral cultural commission meeting scheduled for
                        September in which Department and <gloss target="#t_ForMin_1">ForMin</gloss>
                        will discuss cooperative programs.</p>
                    <pb n="125" facs="0174" xml:id="pg_125"/>
                    <p>2. We wish to stress fact that present high degree of cooperation between
                            <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> and U.S. is dependent to some
                        extent on the personal relationships between highest officials on both
                        sides. <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>’s willingness to be very
                        forthcoming in cooperation could lessen to a degree if it were to conclude
                        that the present relationship is not producing the concrete results,
                        political, economic and financial, for which Mexico is looking. Therefore,
                        it is important to move quickly to take advantage of current favorable
                        atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>3. Mexico’s needs and opportunities are numerous. Among most pressing
                        are:</p>
                    <p>A. Education—Embassy could develop across-the-board plan, using exchanges, to
                        have input at all levels Mexican educational system, from primary schools
                        through university level. No formal U.S. studies program currently exists in
                        Mexico, and new administration has placed priority in establishment of a
                        U.S. studies center. Another <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> priority
                        is establishing pedagogical university. Since large numbers of Mexican
                        teachers would be trained at this university, impact throughout Mexican
                        educational system would be enormous. Another area is curriculum, where much
                        more emphasis could be put on study of U.S. education as low as primary
                        school level. At university level, increased number of <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName> professors could augment total
                        input into education system, as could increased scholarships for graduate
                        training in educational fields. From <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        point of view, Mexico’s expertise in bilingual, bicultural education could
                        be of great use to U.S. educators.</p>
                    <p>B. Demographic studies—given nature of problem of migration to U.S. by
                        Mexicans, this another critical field in which <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                            >GOM</gloss> striving for solutions. New Ministry of Human Settlements
                        extremely active and staffed by some of Mexico’s brightest, most energetic
                        specialists. Here too benefits of such cooperation would benefit both
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>C. Clearinghouse for educational opportunities—originally proposed by Embassy
                        in 1975 Cultural Commission meeting, this center would inventory existing
                        exchange programs (public and private) since an awareness of extent such
                        activity is essential to coordination of efforts in education. <gloss
                            target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> recognizes need for such an organization
                        and would willingly cooperate with <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        initiatives.</p>
                    <p>D. Economic areas—in interest of both countries is sophisticated treatment of
                        principal areas: trade policy, fiscal policy and inflation.</p>
                    <p>E. Intellectual and artistic community—there are great opportunities for more
                        exposure of intellectuals and artists of both countries to the culture of
                        the other. This could be another useful function of a clearinghouse. The
                        private sector—universities, municipalities, foundations—should be
                        encouraged to participate more actively to promote such exchanges.</p>
                    <pb n="126" facs="0175" xml:id="pg_126"/>
                    <p>4. As indicated above, <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> is already
                        actively engaged in providing exchanges and, through such things as the
                        Munoz Ledo visit, has demonstrated its eagerness to collaborate at
                        significant levels. What is required at this point is a commitment from
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to reciprocate.</p>

                    <p rend="center">SUMMARY</p>
                    <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">mission</hi> of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> was, and remains, relatively well articulated and defined.
                        Its flexibility to respond to an ever-changing international situation
                        requires a reaffirmation of purpose and intent in order to assure the
                        relevance of the programs. The Congress is urged to examine both. Public
                        diplomacy is defined and identified as crucial to the U.S. Government’s
                        participation in the quest for international understanding. The Commission
                        notes specific areas where the Agency has been under-utilized, and other
                        significant areas where its role and participation have been
                        indispensable.</p>
                    <p>2. The Commission believes that the time has come for the Congress itself to
                        reexamine the basic statutes that created and contain the legislative
                        authority for establishing foreign information and cultural programs. For
                        much has changed. It should address and reconsider the relationship of
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to the world of 1980 rather than
                        the world of 1950. It should review the adequacy of past legislation and of
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s relationship not only to the
                        present times but to the emerging future. <pb n="127" facs="0176"
                            xml:id="pg_127"/>More than 30 years after World War II, the
                        extraordinary challenges and opportunities afforded by vast changes in
                        communications technology should be exploited more effectively. For example,
                        the potential inherent in the direct broadcast satellite indicates the
                        far-reaching ramifications of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s
                        mission. It transcends government agencies. It involves the Congress. And it
                        involves the American people, many of whom can be drawn into the task of
                        improving the effectiveness with which the mission is implemented.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has been a 24-year experiment in
                        openness. The Voice of America, one of its major elements and engaged in
                        international radio broadcasting to the world, has been in the front-line
                        battles for openness. The result has been a continuing tension and frequent
                        clash between journalism and diplomacy in a process that has expanded the
                        dimensions of openness. The Commission commends those who have struggled
                        with this issue, reiterates that it is a healthy process beneficial to both
                        journalism and diplomacy and concludes that this will be, and indeed should
                        be, an eternal process. The Commission also urges the reinstitution of a
                        Broadcast Advisory Committee that would focus exclusively on the problems
                        and opportunities of international broadcasting.</p>
                    <p>4. The Public Affairs Officer (<gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>) abroad
                        plays a distinctive if not unique role in representing the American
                        citizens’ continuing interest in public affairs. In representing the U.S.
                        abroad to the people of foreign countries, he or she exemplifies and
                        reflects this democratic character of our people. The <gloss
                            target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s practice and policy of cultivating
                        associates and prodding Embassy personnel for openness in communications
                        become apparent to all groups and levels of a foreign country with which the
                            <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> is permitted to communicate. The
                            <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> is a specialist in communications
                        whose primary interest is public affairs.</p>
                    <p>5. This Commission, taking into account the impact of the visits to the
                        Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and the People’s Republic of China, by former
                        Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>, and reiterating the need to promote
                        and sustain a relaxation-of-tensions atmosphere, calls for “patience and
                        fortitude” in improving communications channels and contacts with the
                        peoples of these countries. For the Commission contrasts the rate of change
                        in communist countries with the U.S. and other Western countries. The
                        Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (<gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                            >CSCE</gloss>) in Helsinki<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">July 29–August 1,
                            1975.</note> also opened new avenues of communication. Hopefully, the
                        forthcoming conference in Belgrade<note n="3" xml:id="d46fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d25fn4">footnote 4, Document 25</ref>.</note> will chart
                        the achievements as well as retreats and then call for the continued
                            lower<pb n="128" facs="0177" xml:id="pg_128"/>ing of barriers and
                        reduction of obstacles to communication that began during the initial period
                        of detente.</p>
                    <p>6. The Commission applauds the successful efforts of President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and the Congress to recapture the
                        initiative in the ideological arena and in the struggle over issues before
                        the court of world opinion. The cause of human rights is probably the most
                        revolutionary principle in the world. The President’s sustained interest in
                        espousing it represents a continuing, albeit complex, challenge to those who
                        guide the affairs of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. An effective
                        and prudent use of this principle will inspire hundreds of millions
                        throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>7. “The Commission believes that larger goals and tasks should be set for
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and that a gradually stepped-up
                        campaign should be mapped to augment its audiences by giving the people of
                        the world more information about the U.S.—not necessarily <hi rend="italic"
                            >more news</hi> but <hi rend="italic">more information</hi>.”</p>
                    <p>8. The Commission does “not believe that the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> should be returned to the State Department, as that
                        Department is currently organized and constituted.” We believe that the <hi
                            rend="italic">structure</hi> of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        must include all elements of public diplomacy—fragmentation is not the
                        answer. The Commission recommends that the Bureau of Educational and
                        Cultural Affairs be removed from the State Department and merged with <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. It also recommends that the Voice of
                        America remain a vital participant in the U.S. information program, but with
                        the injunction that its Director “command an appropriate share of
                        responsibility, resource and authority,” by elevating the rank and position

                    <p>9. The Agency should remain independent. The Commission appreciates the
                        current efforts to consolidate government operations, but feels that
                        reduction of the number of agencies cannot be viewed as an end in itself. If
                        the goal sought is increased efficiency and effectiveness of operation, the
                        members of this Commission have concluded that, under present conditions,
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should retain its present
                        autonomy.</p>
                    <p>10. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> remains a seriously
                        under-capitalized agency. Both the Congress and the Executive must address
                        this issue carefully. The following letter from Dr. <persName

                    </p>
                    <p>1. The power of communications should be acknowledged, and confidence in its
                        ability to effect increased international and intercultural understanding
                        substantially strengthened. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should
                        consider <pb n="129" facs="0178" xml:id="pg_129"/>the effectively televised
                        version of “Roots”<note n="5" xml:id="d46fn5">Reference is to the television
                            miniseries based on Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alex Haley’s 1976
                            novel <hi rend="italic">Roots: The Saga of an American Family</hi>.
                            Broadcast on the <gloss target="#t_ABC_1">ABC</gloss> television network
                            from January 23 through January 30, 1977, the miniseries attracted
                            millions of viewers and received 9 Emmy awards.</note> as an example of
                        how one mass media program provided new information and produced significant
                        changes in attitude.</p>
                    <p>2. The assessment of foreign public opinion must be systematically and
                        routinely undertaken, and the results made available to those engaged in
                        foreign policy decisions within the Executive Branch as well as the
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>3. The Office of Congressional Relations must be strengthened and
                        restructured.</p>
                    <p>4. The work of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is rarely appreciated,
                        and the Commission invites the critical examination of Congress and the
                        domestic media to substantiate Commission claims that recent <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> efforts in promoting worldwide
                        celebration of the American Bicentennial have been outstanding.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d46fn6">See <ref target="#d37fn4">footnote 4, Document
                            37</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>5. The internal structure of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must be
                        reviewed: personnel, administration and management, media services, all are
                        in need of examination to assure continuing relevance and responding to
                        demands for flexible change.</p>
                    <p>6. The news reported by the Voice must be freely disseminated, and remain
                        both credible and competitive. There can be no distortion or prior restraint
                        of news broadcasts. “<gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has demonstrated
                        over the years that it is an alert, competitive, extremely capable and
                        credible international broadcaster; <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> . .
                        . ranks with <gloss target="#t_BBC_1">BBC</gloss> as the two
                        most-listened-to international radio broadcasters.”</p>
                    <p>7. The physical presence of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s top
                        management at <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> must become more regular,
                        and the personnel and operations of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        should be consolidated into greatly improved facilities.</p>
                    <p>8. The whole of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should be housed in
                        one building.</p>
                    <p>9. The Research element of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should be
                        strengthened in terms of financial support, the acceptability of its
                        function, and the professional character and capability of its personnel.
                        For without an “Ear of America” there can be no effective “Voice of
                        America.”</p>
                    <p>10. All <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> personnel in top management
                        should “demonstrate an understanding of research as well as (its)
                        application . . .” before assuming positions of leadership in covering
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s responsibility for vast
                        geographic areas of the world, managing the Agency’s media or coordinating
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s policy mechanism.</p>
                    <pb n="130" facs="0179" xml:id="pg_130"/>
                    <p>11. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should continue its efforts to
                        communicate with the academic community. It should also develop a “closer
                        relationship with the fifty states of the Union.”</p>
                    <p>12. The Public Affairs Officer should be granted the status and career
                        objectives currently available to the State Department’s Foreign Service
                        Officers by increasing in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> the number
                        of Career Ministers and by establishing a new top-title comparable to that
                        of Career Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>13. The personnel systems within <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        should be thoroughly examined and remedied in order to provide real service
                        to the Agency, rather than forcing unduly the Agency’s employees to conform
                        to overly rigid requirements. To further this goal, the Commission urges the
                        return of the Office of Personnel to the Office of Administration, a
                        practice that prevails in most government agencies.</p>
                    <p>14. More attention must be given to the coordinated efforts of the media
                        support available to the field.</p>
                    <p>15. There are too many rules and regulations—the bureaucratic machinery is
                        once again in need of cleaning.</p>
                    <p>16. Labor Information Officers were eliminated due to budget cuts—the
                        Commission recommends their contribution be made available once again.</p>
                    <p>17. The effective role and positive impact of special exhibits are
                        appreciated, and it is recommended that there be more, in all geographic
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>18. English teaching requires quantum expansion.</p>
                    <p>19. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should begin to plan now for
                        commemorating the bicentennial of the ratification of the American
                        Constitution and its Bill of Rights.<note n="7" xml:id="d46fn7">1987 and

                    <p>I attach the highest importance to the integrity of the Voice of America. It
                        holds in trust—at all times, and in all circumstances—an important,
                        continuing obligation to the national interests of the United States. I
                        share that obligation.</p>
                    <p>I am herewith establishing the following guidelines to implement the

                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> will be solely responsible for the

                    <p>2. The Office of Policy and Plans (<gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss>) is

                        commentaries and analyses. Post-broadcast critiques will be regularly
                        conducted. I expect <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> to inform <gloss
                            target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> of projected commentaries and analyses and

                        whenever time permits. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> will continue to

                    <p>3. Policy guidance from other <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> elements

                    <p>5. I expect that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> will look to <gloss

                    <p>You might be interested in the attached briefing note reporting on public
                        opinion on the human rights issue, drawn from a recent <gloss

                        France, Germany, Canada and Japan.</p>
                    <p>I should note that to be suitable for a general opinion survey, the questions
                        were kept simple, and did not explore the ramifications of the issue in
                        relation to other foreign policy questions. Therefore it is not possible to
                        interpret the results as a full endorsement, in public opinion, of the way
                        President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> has handled this
                        issue. But we found strong support for the general principle of speaking out

                        <p rend="center">FOREIGN PUBLIC OPINION ON U.S. ADVOCACY OF HUMAN RIGHTS</p>
                        <p>In mid-April, a majority in Germany (63%) and roughly half of the general
                            public in four other major industrial democracies were aware of
                            “statements by the U.S. in the past few months criticizing violations of
                            human rights by the U.S.S.R. and other countries.”</p>
                        <p>Contrary to the misgivings expressed by some Western leaders and
                            commentators about the risks of injecting a “moral challenge” into
                            foreign policy, the President’s statements on human rights have struck a
                            responsive chord among the more informed public. Among those aware of
                            the U.S. position, majorities believed pronouncements on human rights to
                            be “a good idea.”</p>

                            democracies—ranging from 61% in Canada to 78% in Germany—thought
                            outspoken advocacy of human rights by “other Western leaders” would also
                            be a good thing. In Japan, the level of those expressing an opinion was
                            characteristically much lower, but the margin of approval for other
                            leaders speaking out on the issue was better than two-to-one (36% vs.
                            15%).</p>

                    <p>United States “public diplomacy”—international information, education, and
                        cultural relations—is being extensively reexamined in and out of Government.
                        Various proposals call for redefining the mission of public diplomacy,
                        changing or eliminating functions, and reorganizing the administering
                        apparatus.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">STANTON PANEL REPORT</p>
                    <p>The most prominent and comprehensive report suggesting changes in
                        organizational arrangements to conduct U.S. public diplomacy is that of the
                        Panel on International Information, Education, and Cultural Relations
                            (<persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> Panel), a group of
                        private citizens.</p>
                    <p>The report, published in March 1975, was endorsed 3 months later by the
                        Commission on the Organization of the Government for the Conduct of Foreign
                        Policy (<persName corresp="#p_MJT_2">Murphy</persName> Commission).<note

                        opposed several of the proposals. The State Department and the United States
                        Information Agency are on record against all but one of them.</p>
                    <p>The report is being reviewed by the executive branch and is slated for
                        consideration in the Congress.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_GAO_1">GAO</gloss>’s review is confined to the <persName
                            corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> Panel recommendations. In the final
                        chapter, however, <gloss target="#t_GAO_1">GAO</gloss> notes certain
                        nonorganizational changes that merit attention in the ongoing effort to
                        improve U.S. public diplomacy. (See pp. 34 to 36.)</p>
                    <p>One of the Panel’s proposals would improve present operations; two others
                        seem promising but require further study; and the remainder—which
                        contemplate a major reorganization—seem more likely to hinder than to
                        advance the efficiency and effectiveness of U.S. public diplomacy. The
                        latter proposals would achieve a certain tidiness on paper at the expense of
                        arrangements that essentially have met the test of practicality and
                        performance.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Policy information function</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Panel proposes to reassign to the State Department the U.S. Information
                        Agency’s role in articulating and advocating U.S. foreign policy overseas.
                        This is based on the Panel’s distinction between “policy” information—which
                        covers the Government’s “stance on foreign policy questions of immediate
                        concern”—and “general” information.</p>
                    <p>Like many other observers, <gloss target="#t_GAO_1">GAO</gloss> believes the
                        two kinds of information are often mutually reinforcing and difficult in
                        practice to separate. The primary responsibility for articulating and
                        advocating as well as formulating U.S. foreign policy is vested in the
                        President and the Secretary of State. A role of the U.S. Information Agency
                        is to give resonance abroad to authoritative definitions and interpretations
                        of that policy under State Department guidance. For the most part this work
                        appears to be done professionally and to the State Department’s general
                        satisfaction. <gloss target="#t_GAO_1">GAO</gloss> believes the U.S.
                        Information Agency should retain its policy information role. (See pp. 9 to
                        13, 15, and 16.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                        <hi rend="italic">Policy advisory function</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Panel also proposes to transfer to the State Department the U.S.
                        Information Agency’s function of advising U.S. policymakers on the policy
                        implications of foreign public opinion. This function is in fact performed
                        by several Federal agencies. The U.S. Information Agency’s cultural and
                        media contacts abroad enable it to make a distinctive advisory
                        contribution.</p>
                    <p>There have been complaints, echoed by the Panel, that this contribution has
                        not been properly utilized. How adequately it is utilized, how much it
                        differs from that of other agencies, and whether the “neglect” of U.S.
                        Information Agency policy advice can be corrected by means other than
                        transferring the advisory function are among the unanswered questions raised
                        by this proposal. Pending further study of such questions, the present
                        arrangement should be left intact. (See pp. 9, 10, 13, 14, and 16.)</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Panel proposes to consolidate the cultural functions of the State
                        Department’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and those of the
                        U.S. Information Agency. A single agency would be responsible for both the
                        domestic and overseas aspects of U.S. general information, educational, and
                        cultural programs. <gloss target="#t_GAO_1">GAO</gloss> believes, as do most
                        persons consulted, that this proposal is constructive. It would lead to more
                        efficient and consistent administration of U.S. cultural programs. (See pp.

                    </p>
                    <p>The Panel proposes that the new information agency be placed “under—but not
                        in—the Department” as an “autonomous” agency on the model of the Arms
                        Control and Disarmament Agency.</p>
                    <p>Both independent status for the information agency and the Panel’s
                        alternative have distinct advantages and shortcomings. Either could work
                        well. The choice should be based on a careful study of the pros and
                        cons.</p>
                    <p>If the agency were assigned to State, however, some safeguards and some
                        vigilance would be advisable to protect the agency’s professional integrity
                        and its ability to cover objectively not only the State Department but other
                        agencies and branches of Government as well as the private sector. (See pp.
                        19 to 24.)</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Field reorganization</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Panel proposes to reorganize U.S. overseas missions so that articulating
                        “policy” information would be the exclusive responsibility of State
                        Department officers while “general” information and cultural programs would
                        be the province of Information and Cultural Affairs Agency officers. This
                        would fragment what the Panel itself describes as “the unified organization
                        which has worked so effectively in the field for over twenty years.” The
                        present trend toward closer integration of those activities in the overseas
                        missions should be encouraged. (See pp. 25 to 27.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                        <hi rend="italic">Voice of America</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Panel proposes to make the Voice of America an independent agency under
                        its own board, asserting that this “would enable the Voice of America to
                        function as a credible medium.”</p>
                    <p>The Panel offers no evidence that present Voice of America broadcasts lack
                        credibility, credence, or listenership. Audience research by the U.S.
                        Information Agency and others in recent years suggests otherwise. Similarly,
                        the Panel implies without attempting to demonstrate that Voice of America
                        does not satisfy the needs of the Department of State. The evidence again
                        points in the other direction. Implementing this proposal would add
                        considerably to costs of operation.</p>
                    <p>How U.S. foreign policy is reported and advocated, especially by fast media
                        and especially in moments of international crisis, can greatly affect the
                        national interest for good or ill. For an agency billed and perceived as
                        “the” Voice of America, there can be circumstances in which diplomatic needs
                        ought to prevail over journalistic concerns.</p>
                    <p>It should be emphasized, however, that circumstances justifying State
                        Department or White House intervention in Voice of America <pb n="139"

                        prerogative should be exercised with restraint and in full awareness of the
                        need to protect Voice of America’s professional integrity.</p>
                    <p>The present structural relationship between the Voice of America, the U.S.
                        Information Agency, and the Department of State should be preserved, but
                        efforts should be made to improve the working relationships. (See pp. 28 to

                        cooperation with <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and their role in

                            Trip—Summary Points of our Previous Discussions</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>1. A basic problem up to now has been credibility in answering the question,
                        “why is she going?” when it is put by U.S. critics and “why is she coming?”
                        when raised by Latinos. It is necessary if at all possible to push through
                        the media and other filters the fact that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_CR_1"
                            >Carter</persName> is one of the President’s closest advisers who can be
                        expected to give impressions and advice on her return from the area that
                        will indeed be heeded. This is a message that goes poorly through media
                        filters but one which her presence overseas should do much to dramatize.
                        Trying to make this effect last is a function of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss>’ continuing work with audiences on the ground overseas
                        (short run) and of whether the initiatives of the President’s <gloss
                            target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> speech<note n="2" xml:id="d53fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d38fn2">footnote 2, Document 38</ref>.</note> are realized
                        (long run). It is important to remember that the few doubts coming to us
                        about Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Carter</persName>’s trip represent
                        mostly official reaction to the question of her ability to discuss
                        substance. But there are other publics beside <pb n="144" facs="0193"
                            xml:id="pg_144"/>querulous government officials and I think the reaction
                        among them has been and will be extremely positive.</p>
                    <p>2. The word “substantive” in connection with the discussions Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CR_1">Carter</persName> will hold with foreign leaders
                        carries with it the seeds of some difficulties. “Substantive” implies a
                        degree of focus on such issues as arms transfers, nuclear proliferation,
                        amendment of the trade act, the specifics of how to deal with illegal
                        immigrants, commodity arrangements and other things Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CR_1">Carter</persName> will be informed about, interested
                        in and allude to but perhaps will not plumb to their substantive depths
                        during brief meetings abroad. Use of the word without being specific about
                        what you are implying raises a variety of expectations which can create some
                        inevitable disappointments. The word also has the potential for implying a
                        kind of instant expertise, a notion which I suspect you are eager to avoid.
                        Her well-publicized study of Spanish and the issues is a big plus if Latins
                        do not draw extravagant conclusions from this information. Some such
                        conclusions already are being drawn. It might be useful to attempt to
                        mitigate this by emphasizing less freighted words and phrases such as
                        “talks,” “in-depth discussions,” “talks over a range of mutual interests” or
                        “serious conversations”.</p>
                    <p>3. I believe there are two things that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_CR_1"
                            >Carter</persName> can talk quite profitably about and be accepted by
                        all Latin listeners as an authoritative source:</p>
                    <p>(a) She has acknowledged mastery over “who am I, who are we, how we got to
                        Washington, what we represent, what we are doing, what we are attempting to
                        do.” When we look back on the trip in mid-June, I believe we are going to be
                        happiest about the times we were able to provide Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CR_1">Carter</persName> an appropriate forum for that
                        message.</p>
                    <p>(b) The one substantive issue on which she can and ought to attempt to be
                        persuasive is the Administration’s approach to human rights. Feeling on this
                        subject runs equally deep in the White House and abroad, but often for
                        different reasons. While some foreign publics’ attitudes are closer to the
                        U.S. Government position than to their own government’s, most commonly the
                        U.S. approach is seen to emanate directly from the White House and there is
                        much misunderstanding if not outright cynicism among foreigners about the
                        subject. There is something to be gained by emphasizing that after the
                        well-publicized foreign and domestic difficulties of the past decade,
                        Americans are eager to stand for something they can be proud of. This kind
                        of “domestic explanation” of what is perceived abroad only in its foreign
                        affairs context would be most useful and received as an addition to foreign
                        understanding of the issue. I think she could address it quite profitably
                        both in private and, given the proper forum, in public. She could give an
                        appreciation of the breadth and depth of the commitment to this subject
                        within the United States, demonstrating that there is a much <pb n="145"
                            facs="0194" xml:id="pg_145"/>greater constituency than is appreciated
                        abroad and that it does not spring from either naivete or religious zeal at
                        the White House.</p>
                    <p>4. I encourage the avoidance at all costs of the phrase, “I came to listen.”
                        This phrase has been repeated by representatives of each succeeding
                        administration for as long as any of us can remember and is the quickest way
                        to have Latin American government and other listeners hit the “off” switch
                        for anybody who uses it. This is not to say that the same thought cannot be
                        advanced in a variety of ways, since I understand that Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CR_1">Carter</persName> is indeed doing some listening on
                        behalf of the President. A reasonable substitute would be a presentation
                        incorporating the fact that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_CR_1"
                            >Carter</persName> has been to Latin America on more than one previous
                        occasion, that there are differences of approach incorporated into the
                        President’s <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> speech and that she is
                        present to bring people up to date on <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> administration emphases and would like to hear
                        people’s firsthand reactions to them.</p>
                    <p>5. The word “new” as in “new frontier,” “new deal” and “new dialogue” could
                        be avoided at no cost to Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_CR_1"
                        >Carter</persName>’s credibility. Many Latin American listeners are fully
                        inclined to give us a fair hearing on how “new” things will manifest
                        themselves. But many expressed themselves quite lucidly in their
                        “okay-up-to-now-but-let’s-wait-and-see-what-happens” reaction to the <gloss
                            target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> speech.</p>
                    <p>6. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Carter</persName>’s instincts are
                        accurate in avoiding the “lady bountiful” image by down playing emphasis on
                        children’s hospitals and other “women’s things”. The attempt to allow Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d53fn3">Reference is to Grace Vance, who accompanied the
                            First Lady on her trip. </note> to show the flag in this fashion, so as
                        not to offend the hosts, is a wise decision, we believe, though too much

                    <p>7. We should not be deceived that there will be any reticence on the part of
                        reporters, either foreign or domestic, to try to nail Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CR_1">Carter</persName> on just what sort of “substantive”
                        things she is doing. I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> expect the Latinos to be
                        slightly more gentle about it than the touring Americans. The foreign press
                        must be taken seriously. They are basically friendly and every attempt
                        should be made to give them equitable treatment and access. Though they will
                        sometimes make demands or requests which cannot be met, a special effort
                        should be made to treat them fairly—they will repay this effort many times
                        over. Despite the fact there are only 20 seats on Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CR_1">Carter</persName>’s plane, it must be realized that
                        there is not an infrastructure of mass communications existing in Latin
                        America except via the wire services for covering the trip. If there is to

                    <p>We discussed briefly last week the need for a new/expanded relationship with
                        the Department of State.</p>
                    <p>The problem with State is roughly the same that exists with the White
                        House—basically we do not have access to the intellectual process that goes
                        into foreign policy decisions and events. If <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> is to support U.S. foreign policy, we need to know in
                        advance what we are trying to accomplish, how we plan to get there, and the
                        role <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> can play, including input and
                        execution. I am thinking not only of major speeches but also foreign policy
                        initiatives, trips, etc.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_IOPG_1">IOP/G</gloss> does get guidance from State,
                        usually from the <gloss target="#t_PA_1">PA</gloss>’s in the various bureaus
                        and we do attend most of the bureaus’ weekly meetings. I talk daily with
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWH_1">Hodding Carter</persName> or one of his

                        are usually not plugged into the decision-making process and can only react
                        to events.</p>
                    <p>I would suggest a schedule of meetings similar to those planned with the

                    <p>Today’s commencement is a celebration of what you have achieved and the
                        possibilities of your future in America and in the world. I am not
                        flattering you when I say that this day at Knoxville College represents the
                        best of what our country means to me and to many others.</p>
                    <p>What our view is of ourselves as Americans and the meaning of America to the
                        world is what I should like to address today. I will do so in Socratic
                        fashion, through questions. I have three:</p>
                    <p>—What does America mean to itself and to the world?</p>
                    <p>—Why is the world mindful of us?</p>
                    <p>—And, finally, how do we best communicate what we know of ourselves and our
                        hopes for the world?</p>
                    <p>To the first question—what does America mean to itself and to the world?</p>
                    <pb n="150" facs="0199" xml:id="pg_150"/>
                    <p>At its best—at its very heart—America is an idea, or a collection of ideas.
                        You may at times have heard the criticism that our reverence of the
                        Constitution and the Bill of Rights is metaphysically centered on the
                        documents themselves. That is, I suggest, a misreading of history and
                        fact.</p>
                    <p>It is the idea and the ideals of America that command our loyalties and
                        infuse our image of ourselves and our practices. The Constitution and the
                        Bill of Rights, the Federalist Papers, the amply recorded history of our
                        early days attest to the fact that what had been brought to this continent
                        was not a new idea of representative government. The concept of
                        self-government had deep roots in much of Europe, and Britain was the mother
                        of parliaments.</p>
                    <p>What was new and central was the proclamation of the American Constitution,
                        not on behalf of a divinity or a divinely appointed king but rather, and for
                        the first time, in the name of “We, the People.” It is in these words that
                        the American concept found its uniqueness. It is these words that are at the
                        core of an American vision. It is from these words that flow our legal,
                        social, and political principles and practices. It is from these words that
                        we derive our extraordinary cultural vitality, the lifting force of our
                        ideas, the progressive yeast of our society.</p>
                    <p>I would impose on you in an important way should I suggest that we have never
                        violated our idea of ourselves. We can point to fixed times and fixed
                        circumstances in our history when we faltered. In our most recent past,
                        there was Watergate and there was Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>But none of these aberrations, I assert, could finally stand up to the force
                        of “We, the People.” That force could be warped temporarily; it would not,
                        in the longer run, yield.</p>
                    <p>We have, in fact, brought ourselves through these aberrations to today. We
                        are able again to state that the American historical experience remains
                        relevant to our lives. Once again we can attest to the validity of our view
                        that man is individual, clothed in dignity and at the very center of the
                        purposes of government. And once again, our institutions were tested and
                        have proved to be resilient and responsive. We are, many of us, dreaming
                        again.</p>
                    <p>I have commented briefly on the times we have faltered. But I should like to
                        comment, again briefly, on what I regard as an extraordinarily revealing
                        phenomenon. Perhaps you have noted it: However shrill the world’s
                        accusations against us, however anguished the foreign note-taking of our
                        failings, the standards used by others—in other lands—to judge us are our
                        own. I know of no other country of which this is true. That fact, I suggest,
                        affirms the power of our view of man.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Opportunities of Communications Technology</p>
                    <p>To my second question then—why is the world mindful of us?</p>
                    <p>Our ties to the world are unique. We are not, in the traditional sense, one
                        people; we are many. We are not one culture; we are several. The mystique of
                        the melting pot does not define the American experience.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps you recall what President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> said at Notre Dame on May 22:</p>
                    <quote>In ancestry, religion, color, place of origin, and cultural background,
                        we Americans are as diverse a nation as the world has ever seen. No common
                        mystique of blood or soil unites us. What draws us together, perhaps more
                        than anything else, is a belief in human freedom.<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2"
                            >For the full text, see BULLETIN of June 13, 1977, p. 621. [Footnote is

                    </quote>
                    <p>This, it seems to me, explains—at least in part—why what we have tried to do
                        at home has had such profound meaning for so many other nations and
                        people—people to whom our common past continues to bind us—in Asia, in
                        Africa, in Europe, in Latin America.</p>
                    <p>We are they. Many of them would be us. More of them would hope to hear the
                        reverberations of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> view of man in <hi
                            rend="italic">their</hi> societies. But something more must be said.</p>
                    <p>We cannot escape the fact that our great vitality—political and economic,
                        cultural and military, intellectual and attitudinal—in and of itself
                        commands international attention. Whether we will it or not, it is as much a
                        fact as the attraction of the American ideal.</p>
                    <p>We cannot act without being seen; we cannot speak without being heard. We <hi
                            rend="italic">are</hi> seen; we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> heard.
                        Certainly the palpable international response to our view of human
                        dignity—of human rights—is evidence of both the power and attraction of our
                        aspirations.</p>
                    <p>In all of this, I suggest, one discerns the trails which have led us all to
                        this moment, a special condition in the world which gives rise to a unique,
                        perhaps historic, opportunity.</p>
                    <p>It is in part the fact that we have come through that recent domestic testing
                        intact, even revitalized. It is in part the fact that the world is a quieter
                        place these days. The decibel count is down. Stridency has subsided. The
                        general climate—marred, it is true, by local thunderstorms—has undergone a
                        subtle change.</p>
                    <pb n="152" facs="0201" xml:id="pg_152"/>
                    <p>There is a disposition to listen—an expectancy, a hope for rational
                        discourse, a recognition of the international character of many of our
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>There is an acknowledgment of the need for dialogue. There is hope in the
                        fact that the United States is once again ready to join in efforts, as
                        President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said last week, “to
                        inspire, to persuade, and to lead.”</p>
                    <p>There is, in short, a new opportunity at home and abroad. If we harness to
                        that opportunity the wisest use of what is a communications revolution, then
                        more of the promise can be fulfilled. That revolution in communications
                        technology has, as never before in history, tied the world together. We
                        interrelate more rapidly, more comprehensively, than ever before. And none
                        of us will escape the consequences of that revolution.</p>
                    <p>You, for example, will know of events that affect your lives and your
                        security almost instantaneously. You will have access to knowledge and
                        background to enable you to understand and interpret those events. Each one
                        of you will be increasingly a citizen of the world called upon to speak and
                        act just as, in your role as citizen of community or State, you must speak
                        and act or there can be no such thing as democracy, no such heroic figure as
                        a free man.</p>
                    <p>There is a requirement to communicate, one which engages me professionally
                        just as it engages you personally.</p>
                    <p>But the technology of communications carries with it a danger and a problem.
                        The danger is that like all technologies, it is neutral—awaiting its
                        utilization for better or worse. The problem, it seems to me, is inherent in
                        the extraordinary volume and speed of communications which can now be
                        generated.</p>
                    <p>In a very real sense, we live in a world of instant images. We are flooded by
                        them. We see, but too often what we see is out of context. We read about or
                        instantaneously view events, but they are often without perspective. They
                        are instead the “happenings,” not what preceded them nor what is likely to
                        follow.</p>
                    <p>In Knoxville, I would assume, you are accustomed to seeing Belgians and
                        Japanese and Nigerians. There will be an occasional foreign movie; a
                        newspaper headline about the Middle East; the story on the evening news
                        about Brazil. There may be a Kabuki play from Japan; there is certainly
                        access in your libraries to every foreign culture.</p>
                    <p>And yet how much time, how much thought can we give to any single event; how
                        much can we immerse ourselves individually in any given <hi rend="italic"
                            >international</hi> issue? Our schools, our families, our daily
                        commitments and responsibilities, our jobs, our own personal enthusiasms all
                        have claim to the larger part of our day and the larger part of our lives.
                            <pb n="153" facs="0202" xml:id="pg_153"/>We cannot pretend that most of
                        the images from around the world are more than images of the moment, no
                        matter how they may come together over longer periods of time.</p>
                    <p>We are not alone. We share this overload of “instant image” with the entire
                        world. If we are baffled by what we see or unclear about the meaning of what
                        we see or simply staggered by the quantity of what we see, we are not
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>You see the paradox. There is this moment when the world more than ever seeks
                        dialogue. There is a technology which permits it on a scale as vast as the
                        technology is dramatic. And yet we are, for the most part, drowning in the
                        bits and pieces that are the instant images.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">America’s Public Diplomacy</p>
                    <p>To recall my third question—how then do we best communicate what we know of
                        ourselves and our hopes for the world? What can your society do to organize
                        on your behalf a rational process of international communications?</p>
                    <p>There is a basis in our history and institutions for a process of
                        international communications. The libertarian theory of the press, for
                        example, was written into the Bill of Rights to guarantee a free marketplace
                        of ideas and information. We have spoken since 1776 of “facts to a candid
                        world” and of “a decent respect for the opinion of mankind.” Clearly, our
                        society today must be in the <hi rend="italic">international</hi>
                        marketplace with the same vigor and candor and a decent respect.</p>
                    <p>Since I turn now to how our society can organize this effort, I shall speak
                        again of “public diplomacy,” meaning those efforts through which your
                        government enters the international market of ideas. I should like to put
                        before you a series of principles and purposes which I think should govern
                        such efforts.</p>
                    <p>First, we must undertake these efforts in a manner consistent with the
                        ethics, ideals, and principles to which we ourselves aspire. We cannot be—we
                        must not be—manipulative. To be so would, as it sometimes has in our past,
                        prove corrosive of ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Second, in all that we project to the world we must reflect the fact that our
                        words and actions are shaped by our view of ourselves—that is to say, shaped
                        by the American ideal. It is the best way to bring clarity and coherence to
                        the many and bewildering images others have of us. The American ideal forms
                        a recognizable basis for the context of our actions.</p>
                    <p>Third, a decent respect for the opinion of mankind, today as in 1776,
                        requires that we present our views and policies and aspirations forthrightly
                        to the world. Not combatively, but forthrightly. Our interests require that
                        others know where we stand. And our great presence <pb n="154" facs="0203"
                            xml:id="pg_154"/>in the world leads others, quite spontaneously and in
                        their own interests, to want to know.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, we should do what we can to encourage those individuals and
                        institutions, those coalitions and “networks”—here and abroad—which are also
                        engaged in the free flow and exchange of ideas and experiences. It is not
                        the function of public diplomacy to compete; rather, to enhance and
                        supplement existing efforts. They should be allowed the dignity of
                        independence. But we can clearly help forge the institutional links—and the
                        exchanges between them—that will contribute not only to the civility and the
                        breadth of our mutual perceptions but to the common solutions of common
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>Fifth, we must reach beyond ruling elites and seek out those who are the
                        future contributors to thought and culture and leadership in their
                        countries. Power is always transitory; sometimes it is oppressive. In any
                        event, inherent in the nature of the communications process I am describing
                        is the future as well as the present.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we must insist upon, we must insure, a dialogue. In so doing we
                        strike a balance between our own most fundamental beliefs and needs and
                        recognition of the needs, perceptions, and circumstances of others. We have
                        been so greatly enriched by the gathering in of others—of European and
                        Asian, African and Hispanic, Einstein and Dorati, apprentice and artist—that
                        we are in fact ourselves a dialogue. We know it works. We know the power of
                        listening. We should extend its realm.</p>
                    <p>From all of this, it should be eminently clear that propaganda has no place
                        in our scheme of things, that there is nothing within us that enables us to
                        be propagandists.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing in our history, nothing in our view of ourselves, no
                        tradition, no value system that will permit it. To be propagandists, we
                        would necessarily violate that which we most believe about ourselves.</p>
                    <p>If, instead, all our efforts are permeated by absolute fidelity to the
                        American idea, then we will have joined the power of communication with the
                        historic possibilities of the world as it is. We will have undertaken as
                        well as we can, what must be done—to enter the open marketplace of ideas
                        with the truth as best we can perceive it.</p>
                    <p>As Milton wrote in the <hi rend="italic">Areopagitica:</hi> “Who ever knew
                        Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter.”</p>
                    <p>Your experiences here, which culminate in this moment of commencing, will
                        have touched you with the power of ideas and reconfirmed the value of truth.
                        I hope you share with me an attachment to the idea of America, a commitment
                        to Libertarian principles, an affection for our cultural vitality. I hope
                        some of you will join in the noble <pb n="155" facs="0204" xml:id="pg_155"

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                    <p>Because of his Subcommittee Chairmanship and personal interest in the

                            corresp="#p_FDB_1">Fascell</persName> is impatient that the
                        Administration seems not to be recognizing the importance of viewing
                        international public diplomacy in a cohesive, coordinated fashion and
                        addressing the possibility of reorganization on the basis of such a
                        perception. He recognizes—in fact, he prefers—that you not appear before the
                        Committee with a detailed reorganization plan proposal. Rather, what he
                        hopes for is a general discussion which clearly demonstrates the concern of
                        the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration for
                        “public diplomacy in its full meaning”. He views <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"

                            >Fascell</persName> would like you to appear personally to address these
                        questions in general terms, reassuring the Committee that the Administration
                        is taking a broad new look at the entire problem and stating some of the
                        objectives you would like to see accomplished through this review and any
                        subsequent reorganization proposals. These objectives in terms of <persName
                            corresp="#p_FDB_1">Fascell</persName>’s expectations could include such
                        things as a tightly-coordinated strategy for dealing with international
                        communications policy questions such as satellite television transmissions,
                            <gloss target="#t_COMSAT_1">COMSAT</gloss> receiver stations in
                        underdeveloped countries, etc., a clear recognition of the distinction
                        between international public diplomacy and domestic public diplomacy
                            (<persName corresp="#p_CWH_1">Hodding Carter</persName>’s operation),
                        the most rational use of our resources in cultural programming, etc.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FDB_1">Fascell</persName> feels that the principal
                        gap in the Administration’s present perception is in the U.S. international
                        communications field where he believes policy is being mismanaged by the
                        private sector and dealt with at the technical working level only in the
                        Executive branch. He apparently also feels that the anachronism of the split
                        between <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> should be dealt with.</p>

                    <p>As you and the President consider the future organization of “public
                        diplomacy”—and as the Administration begins to prepare its <gloss
                            target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1979 budget proposals—I would like to raise
                        for consideration the possibility that American public diplomacy is
                        under-capitalized.</p>
                    <p>I do not, for the moment, have specific proposals to make. I hope the
                        zero-base budgeting process may surface at least a few by August. On
                        preliminary inspection, however, I am struck by the following kinds of
                        phenomena:</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> must be the only serious radio in the
                        United States which is still dependent on the vacuum tube. Solid-state
                        technology is nowhere in evidence and the Voice must literally go to junk
                        sales to find replacement tubes, since they are no longer being
                        manufactured. This, of course, is quite apart from the question of signal
                        strength, where we are clearly under-capitalized.</p>
                    <p>—I find it distressing—even given the strength of our private sector—that the
                        richest country in the world has public funds to sponsor only 5,000 exchange
                        and leader grantees annually. (This is, by the way, the two-way total.) The
                        Soviets are miles ahead of us, even in some of our own “backyard” countries
                        of Latin America. The program is clearly under-capitalized.</p>
                    <pb n="158" facs="0207" xml:id="pg_158"/>
                    <p>—Politically and culturally, one of our strongest tools in the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe is the splashy
                        exhibit. We can barely afford one per year in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, appear less frequently in other bloc countries and only
                        rarely in the free world. We have the world’s most vital culture, but are
                        not taking strategic advantage of it.</p>
                    <p>As we move to reorganize public diplomacy, and as you and the President
                        consider resource allocation questions, these are issues I hope the
                        Administration will have in mind. For a comparatively modest additional
                        sum—say $50–100 million annually—we could be having a qualitatively
                        different effect in the world. I do not see a need necessarily to broaden
                        the spectrum of our efforts, but we could usefully intensify those programs
                        which are agreed to be most successful.</p>
                    <p>I am sending a similar memorandum to Secretary of State <persName

                    <p>The relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, the foremost
                        military, political, and economic powers in the world, continues to be the
                        top concern of U.S. foreign policy. Educational and cultural programs can
                        contribute to reducing the potential for conflict by fostering a better
                        comprehension on both sides. We do not as yet fully understand motives and
                        patterns of Soviet actions such as sudden switches in domestic leadership
                        and changes in foreign policies toward other countries. Soviet perceptions
                        of American actions and their philosophical and pragmatic bases are likewise
                        imperfect. The accuracy of such perceptions is a critical factor in our
                        bilateral relations.<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">An unknown hand placed two

                    </p>
                    <p>Educational and cultural contacts and exchanges can play a vital role in
                        helping to insure that these perceptions are first-hand and from credible
                        sources. Exchange activities offer opportunities for direct observation of
                        the two societies and their institutions, and for direct dialogue between
                        American and Soviet counterparts in opinion-molding circles. They also
                        provide the framework within which in-depth studies of the culture within
                        which domestic and foreign policies are made can be carried out. All these
                        are consonant with the guiding principles of <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss>-sponsored programs (Reference A) and contribute to the
                        environment necessary for achieving the goals expressed in the Embassy’s
                        Assessment Report of April 2, 1977 (Reference B). During periods of correct
                        but not cordial relations, such as have prevailed during much of the past
                        year, the cultural channels have remained open and educational exchanges
                        continue.</p>

                        the basis for dialogue by developing a corps of highly-qualified scholars
                        who go on to participate actively in other exchanges. They continue to
                        conduct research, publish on the other country, and, most importantly,
                        provide the subsequent generations of students in both countries with their
                        basic knowledge of the other society. These exchanges, administered on the
                        Soviet side by the Ministry of Higher and Specialized Secondary Education
                        and on the U.S. side by the International Research and Exchanges Board
                            (<gloss target="#t_IREX_1">IREX</gloss>), have come a long way in their
                        twenty-year history. Nevertheless, there remains much to be done to assist
                        scholars in their efforts to contribute to the important dialogue between
                        the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.</p>

                        exchange program, was a prime moving force in the establishment last year of
                        a Soviet-American exchange of young agricultural specialists.</p>
                    <p>Under the active leadership of its Rector who spent a year as an exchange
                        scholar at Stanford University, Moscow State University has in the past year
                        entered into two direct exchange agreements with American universities.
                        Returned grantees established the American Studies Council at MGU and more
                        recently the American Seminar which meets informally each month at Leningrad
                        State University. Important research groups such as the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> Institute and the Institute of World
                        Economics and International Relations also have former exchangees in key
                        positions on their staffs.</p>
                    <p>Visits by exchange lecturers and American Specialists contribute to the
                        exchange of information with such institutions and also open new doors,
                        especially in Kiev, where the Advance Party for the Consulate-General has
                        utilized them extensively to establish active contacts with local
                        educational institutions and cultural organizations. Exchanges of such
                        specialists have become more frequent during the past year and have moved
                        into new areas with the strengthened link between the American Council of
                        Learned Societies and the Academy of Sciences, which is administered by the
                        International Research and Exchanges (<gloss target="#t_IREX_1"
                        >IREX</gloss>). The International Visitor, Multi-Regional and American
                        Specialist programs extend into areas of bilateral interest beyond education
                        and culture, and involve the Political, Economic and Science sections of the
                        Embassy. Their integration into the nomination process for <gloss
                            target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> and Multi-Regional Programs and into the
                        programming of American Specialists and Voluntary Speakers provides
                        opportunities for strengthening and expanding Embassy contacts in these
                        fields while providing current information on U.S. institutions and policies
                        to specialized Soviet participants. These activities are vital in helping
                            <hi rend="italic">to reduce impediments to intercultural exchanges of
                            ideas and information</hi>.</p>
                    <p>It must be recognized that there are advantages for the Soviet Union in
                        conducting mutual educational and cultural programs and exchanges. The
                        Soviets can acquire scientific and technological knowledge in areas where
                        they recognize weakness. They too can learn about U.S. society in order to
                        better assess our positions and policies. By citing numbers of exchanges,
                        they can show in the international propaganda arena how they contribute to
                        “peaceful co-existence” and implementation of <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                            >CSCE</gloss> accords.<note n="5" xml:id="d60fn5">See <ref
                                target="#d8fn6">footnote 6, Document 8</ref>.</note> They can also
                        expand teaching of <pb n="161" facs="0210" xml:id="pg_161"/>the Russian
                        language and Soviet culture and have stages for presenting performances by
                        their best artists and companies.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets run certain risks as well, and these may be seen as impeding
                        cooperation and full achievement of American goals. Through exchanges, young
                        Soviets are exposed to influences other than those ideologically approved by
                        the Soviet leadership. Officials are therefore reluctant to send qualified
                        young participants—especially intellectuals, scientists, and artists—on
                        exchanges and delegations and multi-regional programs. Instead they propose
                        more mature, reliable scientists, scholars and artists, or none at all. This
                        is most critical in the exchange with the Ministry of Culture of young
                        graduate students in the performing arts. Qualified American participants
                        have been accepted in Moscow and Leningrad conservatories but Soviet
                        candidates to date have been in areas peripheral to the performing arts. The
                        Embassy will continue to maintain its quota and urge the Ministry of Culture
                        to take full advantage of its opportunity by proposing increased numbers of
                        qualified candidates.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_ACYPL_1">ACYPL</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_CYO_1"
                            >CYO</gloss> exchange of young political leaders differs somewhat from
                        this same reluctance to send young people on exchanges.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d60fn6">See <ref target="#d7">Document 7</ref>.</note>
                        Nevertheless, this exchange is flourishing at a quickened pace. Potential
                        leaders from each country have the opportunity to size each other up and
                        exchange views during joint travel and seminar sessions, thus gaining
                        valuable first-hand knowledge about the people, country and culture of the
                        other side.</p>

                        invitations for political leaders is so far limited to assurances that they
                        are under consideration. New proposals such as that from the Council of
                        State Legislatures will continue to be presented in the hope that improved
                        bilateral relations will facilitate the travel of these influential
                        leaders.</p>
                    <p>Cultural Presentations of music, drama, and dance continue to convey to broad
                        Soviet audiences the message of diversity and dynamism in American culture.
                        Increasingly they also provide additional avenues for contact through
                        off-stage activities involving American artists and their Soviet
                        counterparts. The recent visit to the Soviet Union by a group of American
                        theater directors which resulted in concrete proposals for several
                        co-productions grew out of the 1976 program of the American Conservatory
                        Theater in the Soviet Union. Philosophical as well as esthetic values are
                        transmitted in these activities which <hi rend="italic">strengthen
                            transnational linkages and networks of groups, communities and <pb

                    <p>Difficulties with the Cultural Presentations Program stem from problems with
                        Soviet handling of administrative arrangements and reluctance to program the
                        more innovative American musical and dance groups and plays. Contracts are
                        signed only after long negotiating sessions and logistical problems plague
                        Embassy and escort officers. The Embassy is attempting, nevertheless, to
                        meet the numerical exchange of ten groups from each side set for the 1977–79
                        program of the General Agreement<note n="7" xml:id="d60fn7">Reference is to

                        their impact by utilizing small groups which will perform and work with
                        Soviet counterparts for periods of one to two months.</p>
                    <p>The special natures of conditions imposed on Embassy activities by the Soviet
                        Government favors the use of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> resources to
                        benefit all elements. Cultural Presentations allow other agencies to enhance
                        relations with their Soviet professional counterparts. American Specialists
                        and lecturers in the Educational Exchanges provide opportunities for
                        dialogue in fields of interest to military, scientific, information,
                        economic and political officers.</p>
                    <p>Private sector involvement is incorporated into some projects listed under
                            <gloss target="#t_CUEE_1">CU/EE</gloss> goals and the Embassy
                        wholeheartedly endorses <gloss target="#t_CUEE_1">CU/EE</gloss>’s continuing
                        efforts to encourage private funding for direct institutional exchanges
                        related to Embassy and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> objectives. Seed
                        money and sustaining funds for maintaining the international aspect of
                        objective-related exchanges are often the minor contributions essential for
                        successful administration of these programs.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union, for reasons of its own, contributes the major financial
                        portion of many programs by underwriting international travel for Soviet
                        participants and in-country costs of American participants. The general rule
                        of “sending side pays international travel”, established for exchanges under
                        the General Agreement, also applies to International Visitor grantees and

                    <p>I recommend you develop specific plans for full modernization of <gloss

                        into the 1979 budget planning process as soon as possible. It will be easier
                        to get approval for these expenditures in both the Executive Branch and from
                        Congress if we put them in the framework of a new thrust in the field of

                        <salute>Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I am pleased to be here this morning at your invitation to participate in
                        your discussions of international communications questions. For most of my
                        career I have been personally interested in this field and officially
                        involved in the practice and the theory of international communications.</p>
                    <p>In thinking about how to start my presentation I recalled a few sentences
                        from the speech the Soviets did not allow <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1"
                            >Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</persName> to deliver several years ago when he
                        was awarded the Nobel Prize.<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Solzhenitsyn</persName> was awarded the
                            Nobel Prize in Literature in 1970 but did not seek official permission
                            to travel to Stockholm to receive the prize, fearing he would not be
                            able to return to the Soviet Union. (Bernard Gwertzman, “<persName
                                corresp="#p_SAI_1">Solzhenitsyn</persName> Shuns Nobel Trip,” <hi

                            Exiled from the Soviet Union in 1974, <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1"
                                >Solzhenitsyn</persName> later accepted his Nobel Prize during the
                            December 10, 1974, Nobel ceremony. (Richard Eder, “<persName
                                corresp="#p_SAI_1">Solzhenitsyn</persName> Collects Nobel He Won in
                            ’70,” <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, December 11, 1974, p.
                            3)</note> He said: “Mankind has become one . . . not steadfastly one as
                        communities or even nations used to be, not united through years of mutual
                        experiences . . . not yet through a common native language—but surpassing
                        all barriers, one nevertheless through international broadcasting and
                        printing.” At the same time, he continued, we know that “suppression of
                        information leads to atrophy and total destruction.”</p>
                    <p>I quote these few lines because to me they epitomize the challenge for the
                        future and, at the same time, the threat facing us if we do not meet this
                        challenge. Certainly we agree that the continuing free flow of information
                        and the potential of today’s communication revolution to serve the needs of
                        humanity is a matter of utmost urgency and importance. So I am extremely
                        pleased at this Committee’s initiative, and I am pleased as Director of the
                        Agency charged with explaining abroad the policies and culture of the United
                        States, to participate in these discussions.</p>
                    <p>Since the very beginnings of our history as an independent nation we have had
                        the strongest commitment to the maintenance of the right <pb n="166"
                            facs="0215" xml:id="pg_166"/>of free speech for all. And we continue to
                        follow most fervently this commitment to the fundamental right of every
                        individual to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any
                        medium and regardless of frontiers. Today more than ever before, this
                        reaffirmation is important because, on the one hand, the major developments
                        in communication technology have produced an information explosion the
                        potential of which is dazzling and, on the other hand, because we are
                        encountering unprecedented attacks on this basic philosophy.</p>
                    <p>Some of the dimensions of the revolution in technology are almost beyond
                        comprehension. Coaxial cables capable of 10,800 channels each are soon to be
                        replaced by millimeter waveguide systems of ultra-short frequency which will
                        carry up to 250,000 channels. Compounding the increase in the number of
                        channels with the increase in the capacity of each channel means that the
                        capacity to transmit “bits” of information per second per channel will jump
                        from 648 million in a coaxial cable to 15 billion in new systems. And when
                        laser systems now on the drawing board or already in preliminary testing
                        come into operation, the figure may jump to 100 billion.</p>
                    <p>These technologies enable the mass of human knowledge to be indexed, stored,
                        retrieved, transmitted and shared by people all over the world. Wisely used,
                        such information systems can accelerate development in the poorest
                        countries. Potentially, today’s technology can afford new levels of
                        educational and cultural enrichment to the earth’s inhabitants. More
                        profound and widespread understanding among peoples must inevitably flow as
                        another consequence of the fulfillment of this communication revolution.</p>
                    <p>With this enormous potential so obvious to us, with our background, education
                        and traditions of free speech going back to Thomas Jefferson and the Bill of
                        Rights, with the United Nations incorporating commitments on the free and
                        open exchange of ideas in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights,<note

                        alone be concerned with the mounting criticisms of these concepts in recent
                        years. Yet these criticisms are coming from several quarters and are based
                        on different arguments.</p>
                    <p>From our ideological adversaries has come the argument that information and
                        communication are not only “sovereign rights,” but monopolies of the state.
                        They hold this position, we believe, because they recognize the power of
                        information in maintaining control over their populations, and contrariwise
                        the power of outside, uncontrolled information. From their beginnings, they
                        have been aware of the importance of mass media but most recently as they
                        have promoted the idea of <pb n="167" facs="0216" xml:id="pg_167"/>detente
                        abroad, they have intensified their internal struggle against what they
                        choose to label “reactionary bourgeois ideology” but which, in effect means
                        the Western ideal of freedom of thought, freely expressed. This, despite the
                        solemn pledge of all signatories to the Final Act at Helsinki,<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d63fn4">See <ref target="#d8fn6">footnote 6, Document
                            8</ref>.</note> in 1975, to “facilitate the freer and wider
                        dissemination of information of all kinds.” As we believe that free speech
                        is democracy’s chief weapon against tyranny, so do the leaders of these
                        totalitarian states believe that control of free speech is a vital weapon in
                        preserving their structure.</p>
                    <p>In promoting this objective the Soviets and their allies have taken full
                        advantage of the recent flood of conferences dealing with international
                        communications. In the past year or so there have been such meetings of the
                        Non-Aligned countries in Tunis, in Mexico City, in New Delhi and in

                        Thus, at last January’s <gloss target="#t_WARC_1">WARC</gloss> meeting,
                        Western European, African and Asian nations voted with the Soviet bloc to
                        allocate fixed frequency and orbital slots for each <gloss target="#t_ITU_1"
                            >ITU</gloss> member nation outside the Western Hemisphere. The United
                        States argued unsuccessfully that satellite technology was new and that any
                        proposal for developing firm allocations now would freeze technology too
                        soon. The net effect of this action everywhere except in the Western
                        Hemisphere will be to deny the use of satellites for international
                        television transmissions <pb n="168" facs="0217" xml:id="pg_168"/>unless
                        prior consent is given by the intended recipient and by all other countries
                        that may be affected technically.</p>
                    <p>The reason for the positive vote by the Soviet orbit countries was, without
                        doubt, ideological; some other nations, particularly in Western Europe,
                        simply needed right now a rational plan for the efficient use of frequencies
                        because of the technical problems they were facing. And still other
                        nations—those in the Third World—used this forum, as they have been using
                        every other one, to battle against what they have begun to call the
                        “cultural imperialism” of the developed world.</p>
                    <p>Leaders and intellectuals in these Third World countries have indicated they
                        recognize the pitfalls of government control of information media, and that
                        the Soviet Union may be exploiting the legitimate complaints of the Third
                        World for its own ideological ends. These leaders are, nevertheless,
                        disturbed by and angry at the near monopoly the developed world has in
                        supplying the books they read, the <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> and
                        movie films they watch, the news stories they read, and even the foreign
                        universities they must attend for much of their higher learning. In such a
                        situation, according to the ministers of information of the non-aligned
                        countries meeting in New Delhi last year, “freedom of information really
                        comes to mean the freedom of these few to propagate information in the
                        manner of their choosing.”</p>
                    <p>This imbalance exists and because we are concerned that all peoples should
                        have the opportunity to share in the potential benefits of modern mass
                        communication, we have pledged our determination to help develop and
                        increase two-way communication among peoples. This must be done in a way
                        that preserves the independence and fruitful diversity of sources of all
                        information. Let us not fool ourselves, however, into thinking that we can
                        ever completely effectuate a balance. But we can understand, we can
                        sympathize and we can take action.</p>
                    <p>The most effective way to reduce this imbalance in the two-way communication
                        flow is not to choke off with control the communications capacity of some,
                        but to increase the communications capacity of all. I said this last year at
                        the <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> Conference in Nairobi, Kenya,
                        where I had the honor to head the American delegation.<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d63fn8">For <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>’s

                                New York Times</hi>, November 2, 1976, p. 3.</note> I was speaking
                        to a resolution which would have had the effect of sharply curtailing the
                        international flow of news. Eventually enough nations came to realize that
                        passage of this resolution might not be in their long-term interest and so,
                        instead, they voted to call for strengthening the information and
                        communications systems of the developing world. The United <pb n="169"
                            facs="0218" xml:id="pg_169"/>States and other nations pledged assistance
                        to help the developing world in this endeavor. These pledges helped gain
                        passage of the resolution. Now we must make good on these pledges—because
                        the ideological offensive has only been blunted, not broken, and other
                        nations may look more favorably on these ideas unless they see real progress
                        toward redressing the imbalance. More important, however, than simply
                        winning a point ideologically is the need to keep faith with our own basic
                        morality and principles. We must act if we are serious about the importance
                        of utilizing communications resources to their potential, if we believe that
                        what we are doing for mankind is the measure of our endeavor in human rights
                        and the legacy we will enhance for future generations.</p>
                    <p>Actually the process of bridging the communications gap has already begun and
                        in some areas is advancing at a rapid rate. For example, more than half the
                        Non-Aligned countries have <gloss target="#t_Intelsat_1">Intelsat</gloss>
                        earth stations. Many of them are connected by telex. India lists 71
                        non-aligned with which it can communicate and Kenya lists 67.</p>
                    <p>At the Nairobi <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> meeting, I repeated
                        the willingness of the United States to continue to share its knowledge and
                        expertise regarding communication facilities available for experimental
                        undertakings. For example, as a result of our supplying India with the use
                        of the U.S. <gloss target="#t_ATS6_1">ATS–6</gloss> (Applications Technology
                        Satellite) communications system, India was able to conduct a year-long
                        program on agricultural techniques, family planning and hygiene,
                        instruction, and occupational skills.</p>
                    <p>India is now planning to build its own satellite. Indonesia plans to use
                        satellites to connect its 50 major islands and 20 Arab nations hope to
                        establish a satellite network. Brazil has plans to link 1,000 of its widely
                        scattered communities by space satellites. But despite these developments,
                        many nations are just entering the twentieth century in communications
                        terms. At Nairobi, I further stated that the United States and other nations
                        with highly developed mass media should endeavor to make available, through
                        bilateral and multilateral channels, both governmental and private
                        assistance to other states in helping to develop their mass media. We
                        suggested that <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> itself should join
                        in these efforts.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the United States Government and private groups in this country have
                        been engaged in journalism training programs for some years. Between 1970
                        and 1974, some 1,137 media specialists from Africa, the Near East, East Asia
                        and Latin America have come to America for training under grants provided by
                        the State Department’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. The
                        Department of Agriculture has sponsored an annual program to bring 40
                        specialized journalists to the United States for training which includes
                        on-the-job experience on <pb n="170" facs="0219" xml:id="pg_170"/>newspapers
                        in the mid-west. At Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, the World
                        Press Institute has trained over 200 foreign journalists and many Third
                        World journalists have studied at Harvard University under the Nieman

                            need to be tough when we have to.” (“Editors’ group acts on world press

                        pool of experts in all phases of publishing and broadcasting who would be
                        available to assist press and electronic media in Third World countries. The
                        Committee also plans to assess the technical needs of developing media and
                        to channel to them available equipment.</p>
                    <p>And just two weeks ago the <gloss target="#t_UPI_1">UPI</gloss> Broadcasting
                        Advisory Board resolved at its annual meeting to participate in any
                        professional effort to insure the free flow of news, including technical and
                        editorial assistance.</p>
                    <p>The effectiveness of this kind of action might be inferred from the sharp
                        attack on the Press Freedom Committee just a few weeks ago by the official
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss> news agency. In response, Mr.
                        George Beebe, associate publisher of the Miami Herald said: “The Soviet
                        Government has shown once more that it is fearful of any challenge between a
                        free press and a controlled press such as exists in Russia.”</p>
                    <p>The formation of the World Press Freedom Development Committee is the kind of
                        positive action we favor—a happy augury, I hope, of the balanced and
                        principled approach that will be taken to address these problems. There are
                        many other possibilities for helping redress <pb n="171" facs="0220"
                            xml:id="pg_171"/>the imbalance. My colleague at Nairobi and here today,
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">William Harley</persName>, and one of my
                        predecessors as head of the United States Information Agency, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MLH_1">Leonard Marks</persName>, have proposed a number of
                        exciting activities and projects in this context which I am sure you will
                        want to hear about and discuss.</p>
                    <p>Suffice it to say, there is need for the United States to continue to
                        enunciate its basic policy in favor of the free flow of information to
                        people the world over, to illustrate the dangers of government control of
                        information and to take positive action to help those with legitimate
                        grievances. We cannot relax.</p>
                    <p>I was asked this morning specifically to address two subjects in my
                        presentation—the Third World News Agency and international radio. At
                        Colombo, Sri Lanka, last year some 85 nations formally agreed to a
                        three-year-old proposal to form a News Agencies Pool wherein they would
                        share selected news items from each other’s national news agencies. The
                        objective, in their words, was to “achieve the broad and free circulation
                        among themselves of news, information reports, features and photographs
                        about each other, and also provide objective and authentic information
                        relating to Non-Aligned countries to the rest of the world.” It is too early
                        to evaluate where the Pool is going but if I may, I would like to summarize
                        for you a few conclusions drawn from a survey of this subject just completed
                        by a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officer at the Senior Officers
                        Seminar.</p>
                    <p>The political declaration which led to formation of the News Agencies Pool
                        referred to the fact that the majority of the Non-Aligned countries are now
                        “passive recipients of biased, inadequate and distorted information.” The
                        survey looked at the news distribution patterns of the three leading
                        international news agencies. They show that some three-quarters of all the
                        developing countries, rather than being passive recipients, are in a
                        position to screen news items before relaying them to end-users. And even in
                        some of the remaining countries, where news services are sold directly to
                        the media, there are press controls of one kind or another. The survey also
                        shows that while there may be an imbalance in the news flow, the charge that
                        international news agencies are biased in favor of their home governments
                        and serve their political and economic aims is debatable. In regard to the
                        Pool itself, the survey found it to be operating reasonably well, although
                        just seven nations were contributing most of the Pool’s content. The survey
                        noted that almost half the Pool’s output had high or medium potential for
                        placement in Western media and that the Pool’s contents contained
                        “surprisingly little overt bias as far as the United States is concerned.
                        Even more surprising is that of the nine percent of the stories found to
                        have a bias, four percent were in favor of the United States.”</p>
                    <p>In addressing the subject of international radio broadcasting, may I start
                        with a few statistics: Well over one hundred million people <pb n="172"
                            facs="0221" xml:id="pg_172"/>around the world listen daily to broadcasts
                        emanating from a foreign government radio station. Other statistics on
                        international broadcasting are of similar breathtaking magnitude. Some 80
                        countries broadcast to the people of other countries daily and they transmit
                        over 21,000 hours of broadcasting weekly. Some 17 nations each broadcast
                        over 300 hours weekly.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union is the world’s most prolific international broadcaster. It
                        transmits beyond its borders almost 2,000 hours of programs each week in 84
                        languages. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is followed by the
                        Peoples Republic of China, Egypt and then the Voice of America, which
                        broadcasts 788 and a half hours of programming each week in 37 languages.
                        (If one includes Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty this total is 1,809
                        hours weekly.) We are followed closely by the Federal Republic of Germany,
                        the Republic of China, the <gloss target="#t_BBC_1">BBC</gloss>, North Korea
                        and Albania. The six other Warsaw Pact nations are broadcasting almost 1,500
                        hours each week.</p>
                    <p>It can thus be seen that international broadcasting has become an important
                        element in foreign policy implementation by many nations. The United States
                        has long felt that it is of vital importance to our security and to the
                        structure of peace to be able to continue communicating our policies, ideals
                        and traditions of free information to the peoples of the world. The Voice of
                        America, operating under a Congressionally approved mandate, broadcasts
                        international news comprehensively and objectively, tells the story of
                        American society and culture in all its diversity and explains U.S. foreign
                        policy with a non-polemical approach. Particularly important is our
                        broadcasting to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern
                        Europe where censorship and controlled media give the peoples of the area
                        distorted or inadequate views of the United States, of crucial events within
                        their own countries and in the world.</p>
                    <p>Whereas totalitarian leaders can in one way or another either stop at their
                        borders, or selectively admit or control, other media of communication,
                        international radio, unless it is jammed, goes directly into a listener’s
                        home. There is heavy jamming in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        and in certain East European countries of Radio Liberty and Radio Free
                        Europe. Broadcasts by the Voice of America, however, seem at this time to be
                        reluctantly accepted by these governments as an official activity of the
                        American Government.</p>
                    <p>This does not prevent them from sharply attacking all three organizations.
                        What has particularly irked the Soviet and East European leaders is coverage
                        of news developments regarding human rights and dissident activities in
                        their countries. They have construed this coverage—in which the United
                        States has been joined by other Western radios—as an ideological attack on
                        their system, interference in their internal affairs and an attempt to
                        embarrass them at the upcoming <pb n="173" facs="0222" xml:id="pg_173"

                        implementation of the Final Act of the 1975 Helsinki meeting. In considering
                        these charges, I would like to quote that section of the Final Act covering
                        radio. It says: “The participating States note the expansion in the
                        dissemination of information broadcast by radio and express the hope for the
                        continuation of this process, so as to meet the interest of mutual
                        understanding among peoples and the aims set forth by this conference.” We
                        believe that our broadcasts have been and are fully consistent with the
                        spirit and the letter of this statement.</p>
                    <p>As you know, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                        recently publicly enunciated his support for the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss>, Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe by asking Congress to
                        appropriate funds for increasing their transmitter capacity.<note n="12"
                            xml:id="d63fn12">See <ref target="#d14fn3">footnote 3, Document
                            14</ref>.</note> At the time he made his request, the President said
                        these stations have been for many years a vital part of the lives of the
                        people of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. While no reliable figures are
                        available—since no surveys in these communist countries can be taken—our
                        estimate is that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> listenership in this
                        area is in the tens of millions daily. An interesting sidelight to this
                        issue is the number of listeners in the United States to Radio Moscow
                        broadcasts. An American social scientist estimated several years ago in the
                        magazine <hi rend="italic">Public Opinion Quarterly</hi> that despite an
                        excellent signal throughout the evening hours, Radio Moscow has an audience
                        of only two million listeners in the United States.</p>
                    <p>In terms of comparative worldwide listening, survey data in those areas where
                        we have been able to take surveys, plus well-informed estimates, place total
                        Soviet international radio listenership in the range of 15 to 24 million.
                        Data and estimates put <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s weekly
                        listenership at perhaps 70 million. RFE and <gloss target="#t_RL_1"
                            >RL</gloss> listenership is estimated to be similarly impressive,
                        perhaps as many as 50 million listeners weekly.</p>

                    <p>In the light of your commitment to government reorganization and of the
                        continuing congressional interest in our information and cultural <pb
                            n="175" facs="0224" xml:id="pg_175"/>programs, I have considered what,
                        if any, organizational changes might be necessary to improve the conduct of
                        the country’s public diplomacy. As you are aware, this issue has been the
                        subject of studies by a number of groups over several years.</p>
                    <p>The studies have identified five principal functions within public diplomacy:
                        (1) “Policy information” is disseminated by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> to provide overseas missions with background and policy
                        guidance on current issues. (2) “Policy advice” involves the analysis of
                        foreign opinion with a view to its implications for <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> policies and programs. (3) “Cultural exchange” is managed by
                        the State Department at home and by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        overseas. (4) “General information” consists of media and other activities
                        abroad to project American society. (5) The Voice of America provides the
                        medium for broadcasting the news, depicting American culture and influencing
                        foreign attitudes in directions favorable to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> foreign policy goals.</p>
                    <p>The Department has concluded a study of the full range of organizational
                        possibilities, including:</p>
                    <p>—maintaining the status quo;</p>
                    <p>—adopting the recommendations made by a 1975 panel headed by <persName
                            corresp="#p_SF_1">Frank Stanton</persName> which would abolish <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, move that Agency’s policy information
                        and advisory functions into the State Department, create a new Information
                        and Cultural Agency to handle <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s
                        general information and cultural programs, and give <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"

                    </p>
                    <p>—giving the Voice of America independent status while leaving <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> otherwise intact;</p>
                    <p>—shifting the State Department’s exchange of persons program to <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, while giving that Agency a relationship
                        to the Department comparable to that of either <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1"
                            >ACDA</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>After a detailed analysis of these various alternatives, I have concluded
                        that the optimum solution would be to consolidate State Department exchange
                        programs and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programs in a
                        relationship to this Department similar to that of the Agency for
                        International Development. I have come to this conclusion for the following
                        reasons:</p>
                    <p>—To maintain the status quo would cause us to lose an opportunity to correct
                        a long-standing organizational defect and to improve foreign policy guidance
                        in our information programs;</p>
                    <p>—I concur with the findings of all of the studies of our public diplomacy
                        that all cultural exchange activities should be consolidated in one agency.
                        The combining of functions now carried out by the State Department at home
                        and by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> overseas would simplify
                            communi<pb n="176" facs="0225" xml:id="pg_176"/>cations and facilitate
                        broad program operations involving both exchange of persons and media
                        products. On balance, I believe the risks (such as a possible reduction in
                        the Department’s influence over the exchange program and greater
                        congressional resistance to funding exchanges) would be minimized if <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programs were brought into a new
                        relationship with the Department, comparable to that of <gloss

                        present organizational and budgetary autonomy;</p>
                    <p>—With regard to the locus of the policy information and policy advice
                        functions, I see significant disadvantages in the <persName
                            corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> Panel proposal that these programs
                        be split out from general information activities. The various information
                        activities complement one another, and to fragment them would result in
                        weakened programs and less effective coordination;</p>
                    <p>—To establish an independent Voice of America would aggravate the present
                        tendency of Voice of America to act outside established policy. An
                        independent Voice of America would make difficult effective guidance by the
                        Department. I am not persuaded that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        would gain in credibility through organizational independence—a contention
                        of the <persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> report and Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName>. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss>’s bureaucratic status in Washington would be meaningless to
                        an overseas audience.</p>
                    <p>—As to the organizational relationship between the Department and the new
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, we considered the models
                        presented by <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>—an independent agency
                        under the direction of the Secretary of State—and <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                            >AID</gloss>—an agency within the Department of State. In my judgment, a
                        relationship on the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> model is
                        preferable. The present <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, like <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, has a world-wide range of operational
                        activities which are complementary to the basic mission of the Department of
                        State. Under an <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>-like relationship we
                        will be better able to integrate the conduct of public diplomacy with
                        traditional diplomacy, and to achieve greater efficiency in our
                        international information and cultural operational activities.</p>
                    <p>In sum I propose that we move in the direction of consolidation, rather than
                        fragmentation, in the organization of our public diplomacy resources. Clear
                        policy guidance is essential, and the integrity of news and cultural
                        programs must be protected.</p>

                        gives me real heartburn. It misses the entire point of the problem of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, which is that its information programs
                        are totally out of date, obsolete and overstaffed.</p>
                    <p>On the cultural side, I disagree with <persName corresp="#p_HPB_1">Paul
                            Henze</persName>. <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJD_1">Joe Duffey</persName> are going to be far more
                        creative and far more aggressive in pursuing a cultural contact than <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has ever been. In fact, the whole trend
                        in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has been to throttle their more
                        creative younger officers. One example of this is the fact that they have
                        been shutting down cultural centers across Europe. Since Europe is the one
                        area of the world undergoing the most important and fundamental political
                        changes from the standpoint of our security, and since these cultural
                        centers are our best source of access to the younger generation of
                        intellectually alert people in Europe, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>’s actions on this score are a typical example of what you
                        will get if they continue to operate independently.</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> report<note n="3"

                        obsolete. I happen to agree with that assumption. If <gloss

                        they should be required to justify them on a zero-based budget

                    <p>I believe the memorandum to the President should be rewritten so as to stress
                        the inadequacies of the memo with the view towards having <persName

                        certain personnel reduction targets in streamlining. Unless we do that now,

                        <p>I do not, of course, have to tell you the salience of this subject in
                            current and future Agency program efforts. The President has made clear,
                            in both words and actions, the importance he has assigned to human
                            rights as a continuing factor in our relations with other
                                countries.<note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">Reference is presumably to

                                >USIA</gloss> is already playing an important role in explicating
                            the Administration’s policies and actions on human rights to overseas
                            audiences. As you will see, we plan to broaden our activities
                            considerably in the future, in coordination with the State Department
                            and other agencies.</p>

                            activities. As the proposals make clear, human rights will be dealt with
                            as an integral element in all Agency output. Our information and
                            cultural programs should reflect U.S. commitment to the subject, whether
                            or not “human rights” is the subject of the particular film, or seminar
                            or press release you are dealing with. Human rights will be treated as a
                            process whose objectives should be considered in terms of results over
                            the next decade.</p>

                            it relates to specific conditions at your post. In particular, I want
                            you to address the following points:</p>

                            level, in this Country Team effort. I suggest that you may want to share
                            the Agency proposals with the Ambassador and/or other Mission officials
                            with human rights responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to receiving your comments on the attached paper. They
                            should be sent directly to me. Unless there are strong mitigating
                            circumstances—personnel transfers, for instance—I would like to get your
                            initial comments by July 30.</p>

                        <p rend="center">—objectives, themes, treatment—</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> plan of action
                            is to organize Agency resources for a sustained effort in the human
                            rights field. This plan will be coordinated with the Department’s human
                            rights plans for individual countries as they are developed.</p>
                        <p>Salient features of the Agency proposals are:</p>
                        <p rend="center">A. <hi rend="italic">Objectives</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The basic objective of the plan is to advance human rights. Special
                            attention will be given to:</p>
                        <p>—Increasing global understanding of, and support for, <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policies relating to human rights;</p>
                        <p>—Strengthening understanding of the universality of basic human rights as
                            defined in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Declaration of Human Rights;</p>
                        <p>—Providing support and encouragement, where appropriate, to individuals
                            and groups abroad who are actively involved in promoting human
                            rights;</p>
                        <p>—Creating an international atmosphere more conducive to extending and
                            promoting human rights;</p>
                        <p>—Describing challenges and responses to human rights issues in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p rend="center">B. <hi rend="italic">Themes</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The following broad thematic categories will be given major emphasis:</p>
                        <p>—The policies of the Administration reflect historic American
                            concerns.</p>
                        <p>—The American record in strengthening human rights, while imperfect has
                            relevance to similar efforts in other nations.</p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="0233" xml:id="pg_184"/>
                        <p>—Human rights are a multilateral concern. Positive achievements within
                            individual countries can reinforce each other in assuring a more humane
                            world order.</p>
                        <p>—Human rights include economic and social as well as political
                            rights.</p>
                        <p rend="center">C. <hi rend="italic">Treatment</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Human rights are an integral part of Agency information output, not the
                            subject of a separate “public relations” campaign.</p>
                        <p>Programming will be reasoned rather than strident. It will emphasize
                            human rights achievements but will not hesitate to address repressive
                            practices by foreign governments.</p>
                        <p>In coverage of U.S. human rights developments, our case will benefit in
                            the long run by balanced reporting of both achievements and continuing
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Posts will evaluate local perceptions of human rights and take these
                            factors into consideration in their programs on this subject.</p>
                        <p>While bilateral efforts will be made to foster human rights in special
                            cases, multilateral approaches may stand better chances for success.</p>
                        <p>In <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programming, care will be taken
                            to assure that human rights are considered in the overall context of
                            U.S. political, economic and social goals.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will be sensitive to the fact
                            that, in some instances, human rights can be advanced more effectively
                            through quiet diplomacy than through appeal to public opinion.</p>
                        <p>The following are specific responses to the subject raised in Deputy
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>’s May 30

                        <p>We shall use a multi-media approach in explicating U.S. policy and

                            audiovisual materials, together with speakers. Guidance will be tailored
                            to statements and actions by U.S. or foreign officials, and to
                            significant events (e.g. <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>
                            developments, <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Human Rights Commission
                            meetings, etc.).</p>
                        <p>We shall periodically explore with field posts their perceptions of local
                            human rights situations, and then develop supplemental programs which
                            are responsive to these conditions.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Recommendations of specific steps <gloss

                        <p>The following specialized projects will be proposed to support <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts in individual countries on the
                            human rights issue. These proposals are illustrative, not exhaustive, of
                            the possibilities open to the Administration via <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s programming potential abroad.</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will provide a phased series of
                            videotaped interviews or direct video statements by the President,
                            Secretary of State, other cabinet-level officials, and Assistant
                            Secretaries of State. These would provide an essential overview.</p>
                        <p>2. Agency elements and State/<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> should
                            cooperate in the conduct of at least one, and possibly more,
                            International Visitor projects on an appropriate human rights topic. The
                            projects and visitors would be selected on the basis of their potential
                            for tangible follow-up programs (seminars, workshops, symposia, etc.)
                            and other activities overseas.</p>
                        <p>3. The Agency will provide directories of major American and
                            international human rights organizations to <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                                >USIS</gloss> posts and libraries for reference or for presentation
                            to indigenous organizations.</p>
                        <p>4. We will continue Agency/<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> efforts to
                            foster inter-personal communication among officials, opinion leaders and
                            professionals in the human rights field. Three major programs including
                            speakers and media support will be conducted by <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts in the coming year:</p>
                        <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Human Rights Aspects of U.S. Foreign Policy:</hi>
                            e.g. the impact of human rights concerns on bilateral relations; the
                            relation of human rights to arms sales, aid, technology transfer, etc;
                            origins of U.S. foreign policy emphasis on human rights (national

                            groups).</p>
                        <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">U.S. Challenges and Responses in the Human Rights
                                Field,</hi> e.g.: <hi rend="italic">civil rights</hi>—voting,

                        <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Human Rights Questions and Economic
                                Development</hi> e.g.: the question of whether economic mobilization
                            can occur without suppression of political freedoms and individual
                            rights; North-South issues of distribution of wealth.</p>
                        <p>5. The Department and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should issue
                            guidelines and provide whatever support necessary for Missions to
                            encourage foreign leaders and internationally respected individuals to
                            speak out in support of human rights.</p>
                        <p>6. The Agency, through its Washington and New York Press Centers, will
                            organize a series of tours for foreign journalists resident in the U.S.,
                            including official briefings on human rights concerns and American
                            responses.</p>
                        <p>7. An <hi rend="italic">international conference</hi> on human rights
                            should be proposed for September–October 1978 or in 1979. It would
                            provide a focus for <pb n="186" facs="0235" xml:id="pg_186"
                            />strengthening international understanding of human rights questions,
                            reinforcing commitments to human rights progress, and providing for
                            followup programming overseas by <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            Missions with Agency and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> support.</p>
                        <p>The Conference should be structured to maximize constructive exchanges of
                            experience and views in the human rights field, and to minimize
                            polemical or political confrontations.</p>
                        <p>8. Establish a <hi rend="italic">Human Rights Alert Service</hi>, which
                            would use Agency radio and press facilities to call attention to human
                            rights abuses and progress where and as they occur.</p>
                        <p>In order to ensure that the U.S. effort is fully implemented in the
                            field, the Department should consider establishing a human rights
                            coordinating committee at overseas missions. The committee would consist
                            of representatives from the embassy’s substantive elements including
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>. Its purpose should be
                            two-fold: (1) report on the status of human rights issues in the host
                            country and (2) recommend programs designed to increase understanding of
                            U.S. human rights policies (public affairs goal) and, equally important,
                            encourage promotion of human rights in the host country (political
                            goal). <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts would designate a
                            human rights officer who would be a member of the mission’s human rights
                            committee. This officer would help identify target audience members and
                            organizations committed to strengthening human rights (e.g. religious
                            groups, the bar, labor unions, political parties). The <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> human rights officer would also plan
                            and implement public affairs efforts involving human rights.</p>
                        <p>To take advantage of audience data gained in this way, posts will be

                        <p>Specific Agency actions in particular countries will be determined by the

                            action for each country. Pending the issuance of these plans, the
                            following approaches could be taken regionally:</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In Latin America, the Agency will attempt to make our policies better
                            understood, particularly in view of the bilateral disputes that have
                            arisen over human rights between the United States and many governments
                            in the hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>Because Latin American posts continue to have regular access to mass
                            media outlets, the Agency will rely heavily on the press, radio and
                            television to influence opinion leaders and the public at large. This is
                            particularly useful in countries where the United States is engaged in
                            human rights questions with authoritarian governments and where <pb

                            sponsor lectures and seminar discussions on the subject. Paradoxically,
                            the media in these countries are generally free to report and comment on
                            human rights issues.</p>
                        <p>Despite potential local difficulties, posts in Central America, Mexico,
                            Argentina, and Brazil have asked for speakers on human rights while
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts in Guatemala and
                            Paraguay have asked for exhibits demonstrating the historic U.S.

                            Caracas proposes a television co-production with Venezuelan national

                        <p>In addition to these field proposals, the Agency will: (1) produce a
                            television and radio series dramatizing human rights causes out of Latin
                            American and world history; (2) publish a 12-page insert on human rights
                            in the regional edition of the Agency magazine <hi rend="italic"
                                >Horizons</hi>; (3) publish human rights-oriented books for the

                            introduction into school curricula; (4) recommend that high-ranking
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> officials who travel to Latin
                            America be available as voluntary speakers for human rights programming;
                            (5) produce a radio and press series to create greater recognition and
                            prestige for international and private organizations devoted to human
                            rights, with emphasis on the work of the Inter-American Human Rights

                        <p>African nations tend to applaud human rights concepts in the abstract but
                            many fail to put them into practice. Most African countries are quick to

                            programming in Africa must be carefully handled in order to avoid the

                            One approach will be to call on State/<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>
                            resources to arrange two-way exchanges of persons in fields of key
                            importance to human rights, particularly in law and jurisprudence.
                            Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties Union should be
                            utilized, both as resources for these visitors and as sources of
                            speakers for overseas programming.</p>
                        <p>A second approach will be to publicize, especially through the Voice of
                            America and through post programming in individual countries, the
                            efforts of African countries such as Botswana, Mauritius and Gambia
                            which have good human rights records.</p>
                        <p>Finally, through consultation with field posts, other media products will
                            be developed to further human rights goals. Exhibits, if discreetly
                            done, are an indispensable tool in closed societies such as Guinea and

                            restricted in what we can do but not in what we say. Our most important
                            medium is in <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>. We know, for example,
                            that our international radio programs have been welcomed by human rights
                            groups in communist societies. Indeed, our unjammed broadcasts often
                            have had an immediate and direct effect on the governments of these
                            countries. Western publicity about and support for these activities have
                            reinforced the resolve of human rights leaders in the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe. They also appear
                            to have had some restraining effect on the authorities. We should
                            continue to broadcast human rights and to reject charges that this is
                            interference in the internal affairs of other countries.</p>
                        <p>In <hi rend="italic">Western Europe</hi>, our objectives should be to 1)
                            gain support for U.S. human rights policy, and 2) attempt to motivate
                            the Europeans to become more involved in promoting human rights
                            elsewhere. We can do so by strengthening and/or initiating ties with
                            those European institutions and organizations which are concerned with
                            human rights. This includes those European youth organizations whose
                            views are similar to ours in the human rights field. Our aim should be
                            to encourage the exchange of ideas and information between like-minded
                            people and organizations so that we can support each other’s efforts. We
                            should also strengthen U.S.—European parliamentary links where the
                            subject of human rights could be discussed. This is of particular
                            importance in view of the European Community’s plan to hold direct
                            elections to the European Parliament in 1978. The <gloss
                                target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> exchange program should support this as
                            one of its primary objectives.</p>
                        <p>It has been our experience that when we coordinate a particular policy

                        <p>—Developing library collections for “outreach” programming, documenting

                            addresses the human rights issue. Seminars and discussion programs

                            participate. This approach will only be effective if the scope of

                        <p>Countries in this area have such varying perceptions of human rights that
                            both the frequency and type of program approach must be tailored to each
                            country. For example, a wide range of programs about human rights for
                            diverse audiences would be fruitful in India, but only carefully chosen
                            programs involving outstanding experts before small, selected audiences

                            chaired by the Human Rights Advisor who reports to the Deputy
                            Director.</p>

                            been the primary direct channel to audiences, particularly in closed or

                        <salute>Dear Colleague:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>We are all aware that some critical decisions will be made over the next
                        several months about the basic thrust and organization of the United States’
                        entire public diplomacy effort. Regardless of the precise outcome of this
                        process, we can be certain that public diplomacy will continue to be an
                        active, vital element of the overall U.S. foreign policy effort. Indeed,
                        there is good reason to believe that public diplomacy will assume an even
                        greater importance than it has in the past.</p>
                    <p>It is with this in mind that I have initiated an effort to get <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s own house in order. I believe we must
                        reexamine thoroughly everything we do, and why we do it, to insure that we
                        are an Agency which is clear about its mission, realistic about its
                        objectives, tough-minded about its programs and confident in its
                        contribution to the overall foreign policy effort of the United States.</p>
                    <p>I believe we need a rigorous set of standards by which all elements of the
                        Agency will operate. We need carefully defined guidelines to insure that our
                        varied activities are carried out in a coherent fashion, toward the same
                        end.</p>
                    <p>With a view toward developing a set of operative principles and guidelines,
                        the Deputy Director and I have recently held a series of wide-ranging,
                        highly informative discussions with all Area and Media Directors. A report
                        on these discussions, together with the set of guidelines that has emerged
                        from them, is enclosed. I urge you to study this report with great attention
                        and care. It contains the guidelines on which we shall be building in the
                        months ahead—the guidelines by which all Agency elements will be expected to
                        operate—and some of the basic thinking which underlies these guidelines.</p>
                    <p>This report is only a beginning; but it is an important one. I intend for the
                        dialogue we have now begun within the Agency to be ongoing. I view it as an
                        entirely healthy process, one that can help us achieve a new level of
                        vitality, a renewed sense of purpose and a coherent, unified direction for
                        the Agency’s worldwide activities.</p>

                        <p>The following is a report on a series of meetings that the Director and
                            the Deputy Director held with all <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            element heads on June 2, June 8 and June 15. The purpose of the meetings
                            was to lay out and discuss some fundamental principles by which the
                            Agency should operate. The purpose of this report is to inform you of
                            the key points of discussion and the results of the meetings.</p>
                        <p>Part I of the report is a transcript of the Director’s opening remarks at
                            the June 8 meeting. These remarks have been included in their entirety
                            so that you may have an accurate sense of the Director’s thinking.</p>
                        <p>Part II is a summary of the meetings’ key points of discussion. It is
                            designed to draw your attention to some of the more important problems
                            and opportunities characteristic of current Agency operations.</p>
                        <p>Part III is a summary review of the Agency’s basic operating guidelines
                            under the new Director. These guidelines are a product of Director
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>’s thinking, as
                            refined by the recent discussions. Of necessity, the guidelines are
                            general in nature. The Agency’s management, however, will be developing
                            specific mechanisms to insure that all Agency operations properly adhere
                            to these guidelines.</p>

                        <p>This is a meeting that I came back to the Agency determined to hold
                            rather early, because I thought it was at the core of what I hoped <pb
                                n="197" facs="0246" xml:id="pg_197"/>to accomplish in the Agency.
                            The idea of such a meeting goes further back than that. We have all
                            second-guessed our superiors in the Agency. When I knew that I would
                            have charge, I had hoped to hold this meeting the next day and get it
                            out of the way so we could redirect the Agency as I have thought it
                            should be directed since 1956.<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> served as a
                                Foreign Service Officer in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> at
                                that time.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It soon became clear to me, however, that we couldn’t hold the meeting
                            right away. I was not sure that my 1956 views were still entirely
                            relevant. I was not sure who would constitute the intermediate-term
                            managerial forces of the Agency. I was not sure of some other things. So
                            the meeting is several weeks late. I regard it nonetheless as probably
                            the most important in the series of meetings that I have had—primarily
                            because it is all about program leadership.</p>
                        <p>Over the years the Agency has vacillated, temporized, changed courses
                            with different Directors and different personalities. Each Director has
                            had certain interests and some have accomplished worthy goals, but few
                            have been strongly concerned with leadership of the field program, with
                            being closely involved with <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s
                            operations in Malawi or Germany. We would like to go in the direction of
                            being <hi rend="italic">intimately involved in the field program</hi>.
                            We want to take some of the wear off this hackneyed statement and make
                            it fully applicable today. We want to insure, in short, that the focus
                            of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is constantly on the
                            field.</p>
                        <p>This morning I would like to set forth and discuss some principles or
                            guidelines to govern our operations overseas, principles which affect
                            media and management elements in Washington as they serve the field.
                            These principles will establish some parameters for our future
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>I would first refer to Area Directors specifically, and everyone else by
                            implication. Area Directors are in direct contact with the field and
                            must conceive of themselves as part of management. <hi rend="italic">As
                                Area Directors, you are not a buffer or the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1"
                                    >PAO</gloss>’s representative in Washington—you are part of the
                                management of the Agency</hi>. The guidelines we eventually agree on
                            about field operations are <hi rend="italic">your</hi> guidelines. You
                            will have a fair chance to debate and refine them, and then they will
                            become yours. The <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> and his or her
                            staff will act in accordance with the guidelines, and you will be the
                            first line of appraisal, not defense. It will not be your job to
                            represent <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> but to represent the
                            management of the Agency.</p>
                        <p>If Area Directors operate in this fashion, theoretically we do not need
                            an inspection corps. Theoretically you, travelling regularly, should
                            know all that goes on in our overseas posts. Practically, we do, of
                            course, need the element of objectivity the inspection corps brings <pb
                                n="198" facs="0247" xml:id="pg_198"/>to the assessment of field
                            programs. But there shouldn’t be many substantial discoveries of which
                            you as Area Directors are not already aware.</p>
                        <p>What do we want to do in the field? The pending reorganization of the
                            Agency will eventually produce a new statement of public mandate, or
                            charter, enunciated by the President. But any enunciated charter is
                            likely to go back to the bedrock of the Smith-Mundt Act,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d68fn4">See <ref target="#d1fn2">footnote 2, Document

                                objectives for us: 1) to explain American policy, and 2) to project

                            affluent, and in many ways the most interesting civilization in all of
                            history. American life, thought, development—these are the things we
                            project. <hi rend="italic">There is no way around these two
                                obligations.</hi> They can be expanded on or refined, but not

                            accordance with our guidelines.</p>
                        <p>Look a little further. Every year the State Department orders a <gloss
                                target="#t_PARM_1">PARM</gloss> exercise, setting out objectives of
                            U.S. foreign policy in a given country. Our concern will be which of
                            these <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> is contributing to. If
                            there are eight <gloss target="#t_PARM_1">PARM</gloss> objectives, maybe
                            it’s 3, 4, and 5 to which <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> is
                            contributing. Theoretically a post could conclude there is nothing
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> can do about any one of the
                            eight. We would be most interested in the rationale of the post which
                            makes that statement; resources would be allocated accordingly. The
                            question is, if you can’t contribute to <gloss target="#t_PARM_1"
                                >PARM</gloss>-stated objectives, what can you do? You have your own
                            objectives presumably. These would be subsidiary objectives but not core
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">I like the term contract when we refer to the Country
                                Program Memorandum</hi>—not a contract that’s unalterable for 12
                            months, but one that is valid the day it’s written and approved. The
                            objectives should be set in concrete but not necessarily the proposals
                            for implementation. The objectives are a part of the contract between
                            Washington and the field. Obviously they can be changed in response to
                            changing conditions in a country. But unless conditions do change, the
                            management of the Agency—Area Directors being part of management—will be
                            interested in the fulfillment of the contract, whether it’s in Upper
                            Volta or Japan. <persName corresp="#p_BCW_1">Charlie Bray</persName> and
                            I, when we travel, will be interested in briefings on the up-to-date
                            objectives the posts are working towards, an updating of <gloss
                                target="#t_PARM_1">PARM</gloss> and on the contract posts have with
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. We will not let wining and
                            dining get in the way of these discussions. We will ask the question
                            “What have you done for us lately?” Other elements of management, we
                            should hope, will proceed in like manner.</p>
                        <pb n="199" facs="0248" xml:id="pg_199"/>
                        <p>We would like to advocate in this time of zero-based budgeting,
                            zero-based thinking. We are going through the <gloss target="#t_ZBB_1"
                                >ZBB</gloss> exercise this summer. It looks like we are off to a
                            good start. <hi rend="italic">I think there should also be a zero-based
                                philosophy in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. That which we
                                have traditionally done is not what we will necessarily continue to
                                do.</hi> An essential part of zero-based thinking will be what I
                            would call a central perspective. All of us in this room are part of
                            management, and we must begin from a shared perspective. For example, we
                            should ask the question, “Do we need libraries at all?” From the
                            standpoint of a central perspective we should be able to ask this
                            question and come to some convincing conclusions. “Is a given activity
                            in the national interest?” is another way to put the question. We have
                            always asked that question. You know better than I that in the end we
                            can justify almost anything with that question. Zero-based thinking
                            demands that you ask it with conviction and answer it in a rigorous,
                            convincing fashion.</p>
                        <p>We would like to repeat again that <hi rend="italic">resource allocation
                                will and should reflect the President’s foreign policy
                                emphasis.</hi> If a post is making no contribution to the foreign
                            policy objectives set forth in the <gloss target="#t_PARM_1"
                                >PARM</gloss>, then it should expect resources to be allocated
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The public diplomacy section of an embassy should be like any other
                            section of an embassy. <hi rend="italic">We ought to be an indispensable
                                part of the country team,</hi> and our programs should reflect this.
                            We should hopefully make as great a contribution as the political or
                            economic sections. This relationship will have to be effected in
                            Washington as well as abroad. The contract we have with our posts should
                            reflect all of this.</p>
                        <p>In arriving at the central perspective I mentioned earlier, I would like
                            to set out for discussion several ideas which form my thinking now.
                            First, <hi rend="italic">there is a strong presumption that a public
                                diplomacy section should be a part of each diplomatic mission
                                abroad.</hi> I state that deliberately. It does not mean that in
                            every case it will be a reality. But I think that among the parts of any
                            diplomatic mission there should be a public diplomacy section. The
                            argument can be made that in some places, where our other interests are
                            minimal, it should be the central part. I want to discuss this
                            presumption further because some of you have thought through this
                            question in preparing your papers evaluating one-person posts. Most of
                            these posts are in Africa. One is in Latin America. Wherever they are,
                            Area Directors, as part of management, must take into consideration,
                            except for Africa, that resources to open new posts should come out of
                            the area’s own hide. Latin America will not open in Surinam, which has a
                            good case, unless it takes resources from something else.</p>
                        <p>For the media elements, with the exception of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                                >VOA</gloss>, <hi rend="italic">there is also a strong presumption
                                in favor of acquiring rather than producing.</hi> This is not to say
                            that we are out of the production business. It is only to say there <pb
                                n="200" facs="0249" xml:id="pg_200"/>is a strong presumption for
                            acquiring. I gather from the last two or three months in the Agency we
                            are headed in that direction anyway.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">There is an understanding that the Washington
                                organization exists for managing and assisting the field; our only
                                interest is in the field operation.</hi> There will be several
                            realigned organizational elements—not really new, but the organization
                            chart will reflect some changes. The elements in Washington should be
                            designed to reinforce the principles we are trying to formulate today.
                            There will be a management section including the area offices.
                            Management is understood in terms of managing programs, what we are
                            doing overseas, how well or how poorly. Clearly the front office is part
                            of this management; so are the areas and also <gloss target="#t_IOP_1"
                                >IOP</gloss>. There will be a new <gloss target="#t_IOP_1"
                                >IOP</gloss>, which I will discuss later. This element will ask the
                            question, why this activity or that, how does this library or this
                            seminar contribute to obtaining the objectives of the contract between a
                            field post and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>? There will also
                            be a service element, and all of the media belong in it. Budget,
                            administrative services, administrative control, resource allocation,
                            people and money of all kinds should be brought more closely
                            together.</p>
                        <p>Central to a great deal of this restructuring will be a reconstituted

                            lot in it. It will include all those things it has had traditionally,
                            but with a new focus. It will be the <hi rend="italic">intellectual
                                nerve center of the Agency.</hi> It will have policy, and it will be
                            concerned with plans, today’s and next year’s plans. It will be
                            concerned with evaluations, including inspection but also other aspects
                            of evaluations, such as research—focused research, meaningful, useful
                            research. It must be concerned with guidelines, particularly for the
                            media. It will be concerned with programs in a broader sense. Its
                            relations with our chief medium—<gloss target="#t_VOA_1"

                                target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> still must be concerned with
                            indigenous problems and opportunities. So long as the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> can provide a convincing rationale for
                            a post’s activities, the leeway he or she has always had over operations
                            will be carefully preserved. As the Agency’s intellectual nerve center,
                                <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> will have the dual role of
                            monitoring or evaluating, and thinking creatively, seeing what the
                            possibilities are. Our perspective here in Washington should be broader
                            than that of the officer in Chad. We should see the overall picture of
                            the Agency’s activities.</p>

                                >PAOs</gloss> have at their disposal is radio. There’s nothing a

                            news; but not all <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts are
                            news. PAOs can do much to help us with this medium, and as management

                            <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> should use it. The other media are
                            still important. People still read, look at films, attend seminars and
                            exhibits. The purpose of these activities is to help PAOs fulfill their
                            terms of the contract. All of this has been pretty much generalities.
                            Perhaps in discussion we can set forth some specifics.</p>
                        <p>I want this to be a discussion. Your focus shouldn’t be for me to answer
                            questions. I am far more interested in what you think.</p>

                            <hi rend="roman">II.</hi> Summary of Key Discussion Points During
                            Meetings of June 2, 8, and 15 Policy Explication</p>
                        <p>. . . If the Agency has an obligation to explain U.S. policies—and it
                            clearly does—the question is how are we doing it; <hi rend="italic"
                                >are</hi> we doing it? And the term “U.S. policies” should be
                            understood to include both domestic and foreign policies, since the two
                            are increasingly intertwined in their impact abroad.</p>
                        <p>. . . There is a feeling that, at least unconsciously, the Agency, its
                            management and executors in the field, may not have been sufficiently
                            engaged in policy explication. Whether this feeling is correct or not,
                            it is perceived in Washington and some areas abroad as correct. That
                            poses both a problem and an opportunity for the Agency. To the extent
                            that we do not explain U.S. policies, or are perceived as not doing so,
                            we detract from our indispensability to the overall foreign policy
                            process.</p>
                        <p>. . . People have been backing away from policy explication over the
                            years. It was Vietnam, it was Watergate, the quality of the policies we
                            were having to explicate.</p>
                        <p>. . . We have just emerged from a time when, in this Agency and
                            elsewhere, policies were either not clear or not acceptable to many
                            people within the bureaucracy. During that period, the bureaucratic
                            beast turned away from that and did other things. The question now is
                            whether our attention to a <hi rend="italic">dual obligation</hi> has
                            gotten out of balance, whether by calculation or by accident. If so, we
                            must correct the balance.</p>
                        <p>. . . Going back to the premise that the minimum <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> post is the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1"
                                >PAO</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_WirelessFile_1">Wireless
                                File</gloss>—that means that 80 percent of the effort and the time
                            of that <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> should be devoted to policy
                            explication. Everything built at the post around that adds dimension,
                            additional ways in which the policy explication function can be carried
                            out. We ought not to exist without policy explication at the
                            beginning.</p>
                        <p>. . . I believe there are posts that have been and are doing a
                            by-the-numbers job in setting forth policy. Everything they get is
                            dutifully handled and they have done a first-class job in gaining
                            recognition for our society. Where we have done a miserable job—the
                            Agency and the Department in Washington and in the field—is helping
                            front-line warriors, catching the attention of the audience we are
                            dealing with. I’ve seen in inspections and personal experience that a
                            number of our <pb n="202" facs="0251" xml:id="pg_202"/>officers are
                            afraid to take on the explication job because the subjects are so
                            complex. They look on themselves as technicians who merely provide a
                            stage for the experts. If an issue is there, they are unwilling to take
                            it on. Part of it is training, leadership, whatever. We will have to
                            prepare our people and give them the confidence and the skills to do
                            it.</p>
                        <p>. . . If you start with an officer, even minus the <gloss
                                target="#t_WirelessFile_1">Wireless File</gloss>, he is at least a
                            reflection of the society. He is the contact point, the person the
                            audience knows. He must be someone attractive enough to that audience,
                            interesting to them, one who can develop a relationship with them to
                            permit him to present a whole variety of wares. If he cannot do that,
                            the game is lost. Because we have acquired of late a lot of very
                            attractive wares—<gloss target="#t_VTR_1">VTRs</gloss>, magazines,
                            etc.—we are becoming increasingly in this Agency impressarios,
                            distributors of products. We are by default almost entirely that, or too
                            much so. If a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> officer repeatedly
                            says to a foreigner, “I don’t know anything about that, but in two weeks
                            I can get you the best speakers on the subject,” that officer after a
                            while will not have the kind of relationship which will make him useful
                            in that mission.</p>
                        <p>. . . First of all, you must be able to articulate, you must know the
                            substance of issues and be able to address them. On top of that, as an
                                <gloss target="#t_FSIO_1">FSIO</gloss>, you are expected to have
                            certain communications abilities which make you different from an <gloss
                                target="#t_FSO_1">FSO</gloss>. I’ve found a large number of our
                            officers who shy away from the explication role because they don’t feel
                            this is part of their role. I think this is a serious problem, perhaps
                            one that should be addressed at the beginning of the training cycle.</p>
                        <p>. . . I don’t see how the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> can
                            function unless he has at least a curbstone knowledge of economics,
                            human rights, etc.</p>
                        <p>. . . If the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> or press attache
                            becomes known as the person best able to speak for the Ambassador, is
                            known as an articulate person, reasonable and knowledgeable, I think
                            experience shows that the press will turn to that person.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Indispensability</p>
                        <p>. . . In order to be an integral part of a diplomatic mission, a <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> post must have some appreciation
                            of—and be appreciated by—the entire mission. Receptivity can vary widely
                            from chief-of-mission to chief-of-mission. Obviously, a <gloss
                                target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> must devote time, effort and ingenuity
                            to insuring that his operation is indispensable to the mission.
                            Ultimately, however, a well-run public diplomacy operation is the most
                            persuasive demonstration of a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            post’s worth to the over-all Mission.</p>
                        <p>. . . An educational function must also be carried out by <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> management with colleagues in the
                            State Department, the White House, other Executive departments and
                            agencies, and the Congress. This will help to integrate <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts abroad more fully into field
                            missions.</p>
                        <pb n="203" facs="0252" xml:id="pg_203"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Program Integrity</p>
                        <p>. . . Too often, we inherit setups, and we adapt to the whims of new
                            chiefs of mission. I think it is a rare <gloss target="#t_PAO_1"
                                >PAO</gloss> who will come back to the Agency and say we have had a
                            library for 20 years and now we don’t need it. We all fall into things
                            that already exist and seem to work well for us—without examining
                            whether they are the best ways of getting the job done or not.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Role of the Media</p>
                        <p>. . . The role of the media is in service of the field programs. Media
                            products should not demand functions that people in the field can’t
                            carry out.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Coherence</p>
                        <p>. . . Firm management from Washington should insure program coherence and
                            continuity and preclude wild program gyrations resulting from changes in
                                <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss>—while still allowing for the
                            necessary, desirable degree of flexibility, initiative and creativity in
                            the field. The supremacy of the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> has
                            to be exercised within certain parameters which allow for adaptation to
                            local conditions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Standards</p>
                        <p>. . . It is essential that management in Washington agree on a set of
                            standards by which programs in the field can be justified and evaluated.
                            What is a good library or a good information program? What commonalities
                            exist among the areas? What constitutes a good program instrumentality?
                            These are all key questions.</p>
                        <p>. . . The absence of parameters and standards has led, in the past, to a
                            focus on differences rather than commonalities. If we are going to have
                            a contract with the field, it must be based on consistent standards.</p>
                        <p>. . . Qualitative standards cannot be separated from cost effectiveness.
                            The <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>, the Area Director, Media heads
                            must always think of the two together.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Strategy</p>
                        <p>. . . A well-run post must have a communications strategy geared to its
                            objectives. Uncoordinated, purposeless activities too often proliferate
                            in the absence of such a strategy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Agency-Wide Perspective</p>
                        <p>. . . It is a healthy process where the Area Director attempts to put on
                            the Director’s hat, in confrontation with the less catholic perspective.
                            Angels clearly will sit on the side of the more catholic view in such
                            confrontations. It should not take more than two or three encounters
                            before the word gets around that at each level of management we are <pb
                                n="204" facs="0253" xml:id="pg_204"/>expected to approach problems
                            and decisions from the perspective of central management, that
                            empire-building is out.</p>
                        <p>. . . We are all guilty of parochialism. We must accept this fact and
                            strive for a better perspective on our commonalities and global
                            mission.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Director:</hi> One of the Agency’s statutory
                            obligations is to explain policy. I doubt that anybody rejects this. I
                            have a feeling, however, that in our operations policy explication may
                            too often be neglected, if not rejected. You can read inspection reports
                            without gaining any real sense of our role as explicators. To put this
                            in some perspective, the last thing I have in mind is that we should be
                            running around the capitals of the world even pretending that we are
                            setting foreign policy right. Indeed, I think it would be dangerous to
                            head in that direction. As managers, I don’t want us to do anything to
                            convey to the field the idea that every radio or <gloss target="#t_TV_1"
                                >TV</gloss> editorial, or comment against U.S. foreign policy, could
                            be fixed the next day. Nor do I want anyone to ignore the second part of
                            our mandate, which is to project American society. But I think we need
                            to look continually for evidence that we are taking the policy
                            explication role seriously and that we are engaging local opinion
                            molders in serious dialogue about policy issues.</p>
                        <p>I would think in terms of luncheon meetings or breakfast meetings or
                            dinner meetings with key opinion molders, in which we are engaged in a
                            dialogue about a central issue. The point isn’t to get an editorial or
                            column the next day. If we get it, fine; but if we don’t, we have
                            illustrated to the person that we are talking to aspects of American
                            policy that before the meeting he may well not have taken into
                            consideration. This effort involves setting the record straight where
                            there are obvious errors. That’s what I mean by explication.</p>
                        <p>Our goal is to promote, through dialogue, a better understanding of U.S.
                            policies and society. I don’t think, on the one hand, that we can be
                            satisfied with the seminar that helps local journalists do a better job
                            25 years from now. That’s good but not sufficient. On the other hand, I
                            don’t think we need to pretend we’re going to get different editorials.
                            We need a logical rationale, a strategy for dealing with local opinion
                            molders about American policies in the short term as well as the long
                            term. That is the job of the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>, what
                            we as managers should be looking for.</p>
                        <p>The question of policy explication versus projection of American society
                            is not an either/or question. It’s a matter of balance. We as managers,
                            together with <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> in the field, must
                            be sure that the balance is appropriate at each post. This doesn’t mean
                            that each <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> goes around asking: “What
                            have I done for explication today; what do I plan to do for projection
                            tomorrow?” Certainly there is a real sense in which the two objectives
                            overlap and complement each other. But for each post there is
                            nonetheless a proper balance between these two <pb n="205" facs="0254"
                                xml:id="pg_205"/>functions, a balance which is determined largely by
                            local issues and communications environments. We must be continually
                            sensitive to the need to achieve and maintain this balance. To put it
                            another way: the balance in effect at each post must be supported by a
                            firm rationale. That is the heart of the contract that the post has with
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>Finally, there is a new foreign policy in the land. We, as a chief arm of
                            the foreign affairs community, have to reflect it. We have to accept
                            political realities. One of the great realities is the human rights
                            issue. Another is the so-called Third World emphasis. A budget that
                            allocates over $38 million to Europe and $14 million to Africa is not
                            consistent with the realities of today. There are problems with this in
                            the European budget every year. We should think that over as we look at
                                <gloss target="#t_ZBB_1">ZBB</gloss>. These realities must be taken
                            into account.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                            <hi rend="roman">III.</hi> Summary Review of Operating Guidelines</p>
                        <p>1. The Agency’s primary focus is on the field. Washington exists only for
                            the purpose of guiding, servicing and assisting work that goes on in the
                            field.</p>
                        <p>2. All Area and Media Directors should consider themselves integral parts
                            of the Agency’s management team. Their perspectives should be
                            Agency-wide, not parochial.</p>
                        <p>3. The Agency’s two fundamental objectives are to explain U.S. policy
                            (foreign and domestic) and to project American society. <hi
                                rend="italic">Both</hi> of these objectives must be met. Any officer
                            or post that backs away either from policy explication or societal
                            projection is not operating according to the Agency’s guidelines. The
                            balance of time and resources devoted to each of these objectives will
                            of necessity vary from post to post. Because of differing local problems
                            and communications environments, there can be no mandated
                            explication/projection ratio worldwide. But the balance achieved at each
                            post must be justified and evaluated in terms of a systematic
                            clear-minded rationale.</p>
                        <p>4. Every <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> post should have clearly
                            defined objectives which contribute to the achievement of mission-wide
                            objectives, as defined by the Country Team. The post’s objectives should
                            be viewed as a contract between the post and Washington. Resources will
                            be allocated according to the quality of the post’s contribution to the
                            achievement of mission objectives.</p>
                        <p>5. Every program and activity of the Agency must be rigorously examined
                            in terms of its contribution to the foreign policy and national interest
                            goals of the Administration. Just because we have done something in the
                            past does not mean we should continue doing it.</p>
                        <p>6. Every <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> post should be an
                            indispensable part of the Country Team, making a contribution to the
                            overall mission effort comparable to that of the political and economic
                            sections.</p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="0255" xml:id="pg_206"/>
                        <p>7. Except in the most unusual circumstances, every U.S. diplomatic
                            mission abroad should have a public diplomacy section.</p>
                        <p>8. Among the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> management, there is
                            a strong bias in favor of acquiring rather than producing media
                            materials of all kinds. Excluding only <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                                >VOA</gloss>, we should produce only what is essential and cannot be
                            acquired elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>9. <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> will be reconstituted to serve as
                            the intellectual nerve center of the Agency, responsible for policy,
                            long- and short-term planning, evaluation and focused, meaningful
                            research.</p>
                        <p>10. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is the dominant medium of the
                            Agency. It should be viewed and utilized by <gloss target="#t_PAO_1"
                                >PAOs</gloss> as an integral element of programming, excepting only
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s independent news
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>11. Proper management dictates that Agency programs and activities have a
                            certain worldwide coherence, thrust and unity of purpose, while still
                            encouraging an appropriate degree of local initiative and flexibility.
                            We must recognize and accommodate local differences. But we must also
                            operate from the premise that our activities have certain worldwide
                            priorities and commonalities. We should think of ourselves as a unified
                            communications system explicating the same foreign policy and the same
                            society worldwide.</p>
                        <p>12. Proper management also dictates the development and application of a
                            rigorous and consistent set of standards by which all programs and
                            activities can be justified and evaluated.</p>
                        <p>13. An <gloss target="#t_FSIO_1">FSIO</gloss> must be two things: a
                            communicator as well as the manager of a communications process. This
                            means that he or she must be thoroughly conversant with substantive
                            foreign policy issues. In particular, a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                                >USIS</gloss> officer must keep abreast of the major bilateral
                            issues involving the U.S. and the country in which he or she is posted.
                            An <gloss target="#t_FSIO_1">FSIO</gloss> is not expected to be an
                            expert in every policy issue; but in order to be an effective explicator
                            of U.S. policy, he or she must be able to discuss major policy issues in
                            an intelligent, well-informed manner. What distinguishes and defines an
                                <gloss target="#t_FSIO_1">FSIO</gloss> is that he or she is also
                            expected to manifest an up-to-date, thorough grounding in communications
                            theories, techniques and practices. The two elements—communications
                            skills fused with substantive policy knowledge—go hand-in-hand for an
                                <gloss target="#t_FSIO_1">FSIO</gloss>.</p>

                        treatments) are justified. He also wants to sort out and strengthen the
                        radios’ corporate board and hopes to have this accomplished by next winter.
                        Then, with everything in good shape, he would like to step out of
                        Chairmanship and be appointed to some other part-time governmental activity

                        years. I told him we felt he had served well during a very difficult time
                        for the radios and you were extremely appreciative of his service. We will
                        want to keep him in mind for possible future appointments.

                        largely obsolete, and he would have any reorganization require that those

                    <p>Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee:</p>
                    <p>I welcome this opportunity to testify in the course of your hearings on
                        “Public Diplomacy and the future.” The Secretary and I are encouraged by the
                        careful attention you are giving to the inquiry, and by your interest in the
                        larger issues of international communications. I would like to pledge our
                        cooperation in working with the Congress in the review of policy in this
                        area.</p>
                    <p>Let me begin by putting public diplomacy into the context of its purpose and
                        place in the foreign policy structure of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The purposes of public diplomacy are</p>
                    <p>(1) To ensure that other nations more accurately understand this country, its
                        values, institutions, and policies;</p>
                    <p>(2) To ensure that our understanding of other nations and of our
                        interrelationship with them is informed and accurate;</p>
                    <p>(3) To ensure that this mutual understanding is bolstered by collaborative
                        individual and institutional relationships across cultural lines; and</p>
                    <p>(4) To ensure that, as the international policies of our government are
                        formed, we take into account the values, interests, and priorities of
                        publics abroad.</p>
                    <p>The audience for public diplomacy defines its vital place in the conduct of
                        American foreign policy. Public diplomacy compliments and reinforces
                        traditional government-to-government diplomacy by seeking to communicate
                        with the people of other nations. In particular, it seeks to establish a
                        dialogue with those who are importantly involved now or are likely to be
                        involved in the formulation and discussion of attitudes and ideas which
                        affect the United States. I speak here of people in other nations who are
                        active in the academic world, the <pb n="213" facs="0262" xml:id="pg_213"
                        />worlds of art and culture, in communications, or in government—those who
                        are future leaders of their nations.</p>
                    <p>As you have emphasized, Mr. Chairman, the issues of public diplomacy are far
                        broader than internal government organization. They also concern the wider
                        span of international communications in this age of information. This wider
                        span embraces such issues as satellite television transmissions, <gloss
                            target="#t_COMSAT_1">COMSAT</gloss> receiver stations in underdeveloped
                        countries and the free dissemination of news. As you know, we are preparing
                        for international conferences which will consider some of these
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>We must address these individual issues within the context of a comprehensive
                        view by the United States. This comprehensive view is defined by three
                        governing principles:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">First</hi>, we are committed to freedom of information and
                        expression and the fundamental human right of every individual to seek,
                        receive and impart information and ideas through any medium, and regardless
                        of frontiers;</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, we recognize the vital importance of
                        communications in the development of peoples and nations and of friendly
                        relations between them. All people should have a chance to share in the
                        potential benefits of modern mass communications. Thus, we are determined to
                        help develop and increase the means of communication among peoples. At the
                        same time, we are determined to preserve the multiplicity and independence
                        of sources of information;</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, the international flow of information and
                        ideas must be two-way. There is a current imbalance—for example, much more
                        information flows to the so-called Third World than flows <hi rend="italic"
                            >from</hi> the Third World. One example of our willingness to help
                        correct some of the imbalance is our long-standing offer to share our
                        knowledge and expertise in the use of our <gloss target="#t_ATS6_1"
                            >ATS–6</gloss> communications satellite.</p>
                    <p>The specific and concrete steps we take on the whole spectrum of
                        international communications will be consistent with these principles.</p>
                    <p>We reviewed public diplomacy from the perspective of its purposes as well as
                        the principles outlined above. In this connection we have identified five
                        specific functions of public diplomacy:</p>
                    <p>—“Cultural exchange,” which includes the exchange of people in both
                        directions and the forging of institutional links. The <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName> program, which sends scholars
                        abroad and brings foreign scholars here to pursue their studies, is a major
                        example of this function. It is managed by the State Department at home and
                        by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> overseas.</p>
                    <p>—“General information” consists of activities undertaken to project abroad
                        important aspects of American society. These activities include exhibits,
                        libraries, seminars, lectures and much of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss>’s programming. Most of these activities are managed abroad
                        by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. Programs such <pb n="214"
                            facs="0263" xml:id="pg_214"/>as tours of performing artists are managed
                        at home by the State Department and overseas by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—“Policy information” is a combination of background and policy guidance on

                        information is obtained from State Department sources and statements and is
                        disseminated by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to our posts overseas
                        and to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> draws upon this information for the policy commentary and
                        analyses that it broadcasts. The subjects cover such issues as human rights,
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and the Middle East. I will note
                        in passing that I have differentiated between “general information” and
                        “policy information” because others have done so, but I regard the dichotomy
                        as somewhat artificial.</p>

                        journalism.</p>
                    <p>It is through these five functions of public diplomacy that we are able, as a

                        of others. We recognize that, in a world of information, it is no longer
                        sufficient to reach only existing power structures of other nations. Their
                        own policies are affected by the knowledge and attitudes of their citizens.
                        It is especially important to recognize that younger generations in other
                        countries will soon occupy positions of influence not only in government,
                        but in the media, the academic community, the cultural world and other

                        identified important shortcomings in the present organizations.</p>
                    <p>We have found that the components of public diplomacy have been fragmented.
                        The responsibility for cultural exchanges and some of the general
                        information activities are split between <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> overseas and the State Department at home.</p>
                    <p>We have also concluded that our international relations in the years ahead
                        require more serious attention to public diplomacy than has been given in
                        the past. Public diplomacy has been too distant from the processes by which
                        our foreign policy is conducted—both for the contribution it should make
                        when policies are decided and the support it can provide when those policies
                        are in operation.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, the dissemination of accurate, ample, and timely policy
                        guidance to our missions overseas and to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> has been hampered by the lack of full communication between
                        the State Department and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, despite the
                        good intentions of all concerned. Similarly, the use of public affairs
                        advice has been impaired by the lack of a close relationship between those
                        who prepare this analysis and those who rely on it in the State
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>Our review of the issues and questions involved has caused us to conclude
                        that reorganization is required. The form of the reorganization has been
                        under intensive study, but no final decision has been made by the President.
                        The Administration is following your hearings with interest and care, as we
                        proceed to shape our final recommendations and decisions.</p>
                    <p>Of course, Mr. Chairman, organizations are only as good as the people who
                        staff and run them. In this respect we are indeed fortunate. At <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, Director <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1"

                            corresp="#p_BCW_1">Charles Bray</persName> are already providing the
                        kind of leadership that bodes well for public diplomacy. At State, Assistant
                        Secretary Joseph Duffy’s deep commitment to educational and cultural
                        exchange is already making itself felt. Equally important, <gloss

                        professionals. The fact that present organizational arrangements work as
                        well as they do is a tribute to their skill and dedication.</p>

                    <p>In undertaking a reorganization of our public diplomacy program in the
                        contemporary world, we will test all present activities for their relevance
                        to current and future needs, and their effectiveness. We will identify new
                        activities that need to be undertaken and establish principles for the
                        management of these activities, to assure their efficiency and effectiveness

                    <p>I therefore suggest that, when the current cycle of get-acquainted briefing

                        is no need to set up a special <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff
                        such as existed from 1969–71 under <persName corresp="#p_MGR_1">Dick
                            Monsen</persName> and me, when our workload of <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"

                    <p>But there is a more basic need for <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> to
                        have the <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRMs</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PD_1"
                            >PDs</gloss> (Presidential Directives)—the latter are the final
                        decisions made by the President after the <gloss target="#t_PRM_1"
                            >PRMs</gloss> have been discussed in the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> itself. This basic need is not for participation, but for
                        information—to keep up with the new policy thinking. There is no way to do
                        this that is half as efficient as reading the <gloss target="#t_PRM_1"
                            >PRMs</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PD_1">PDs</gloss>. Actually, in the
                        case of the <gloss target="#t_PD_1">PDs</gloss>, it is really important that
                        we have them, at least all but the most sensitive, because we might violate
                        policy through sheer ignorance of what the President has decided.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRMs</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PD_1"
                            >PDs</gloss> would be an invaluable aid in our thinking and planning
                        ahead. It is particularly important in the complex fields—such as national
                        security, economics, and science—because these take the longest to think
                        through and come up with accurate formulations which are as clear and simple
                        and non-technical as possible. The regional <gloss target="#t_PRM_1"
                            >PRMs</gloss> are also important.</p>

                    <p>The big functional gap in <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> is that no one
                        is charged with generalist intellectual leadership of the slow media. <gloss
                            target="#t_IOPG_1">IOP/G</gloss> does this for fast media, but slow
                        media do have a peculiar need for an intellectual nerve center, a spark or
                        catalyst of ideas, and <hi rend="italic">not only</hi> in certain selected
                        subject areas. So I propose the creation of a “generalist catalyst” staff
                        within <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss>. This should have enough people
                        in it so that there would be at least one for each medium, preferably with
                        some experience in that medium. The essential qualification would be a
                        lively, wide-ranging mind exploring a variety of subjects and ideas.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCR_1">Beecham</persName> has a point: somebody
                        should read their magazines. Not only that, but have discussions in the

                    <p>All this comprises a separate function, “help”, which is conceptually

                        seems pretty good to me as is. But it seems to me we need more flexibility

                    <p>The way we do this now is through the precepts and area program memoranda. It
                        seems to me that setting these up for a whole year at a time is too rigid.
                        Perhaps we should consider cutting the period to six months, or maybe a
                        better way would be to set them for a year but with the understanding that
                        one or more could be changed during the year as the need arises.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps precepts are outdated and should be replaced by campaigns, much more
                        specific and structured than the general language of policy themes. Finally,
                        maybe the way to do it is to have one or two basic themes and one or two
                        campaigns each year.</p>

                    <p>Acting on the conviction that public diplomacy can make a critical
                        contribution to the U.S. effort to bring peace to the Middle East, <gloss
                            target="#t_INA_1">INA</gloss> has formed a “Middle East Working Group”
                        to increase and focus Agency programming in support of this peace
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>The principal function of the Working Group will be to stimulate development
                        of programs and media materials for use by the concerned posts (and <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>) in communicating with appropriate
                        audiences about U.S. policy in the Middle East. In this pre-negotiation
                        stage of the peace effort, we see a basic imperative to “keep the record
                        straight” on just where the U.S. Government stands. It is also important to
                        inform area elites of U.S. public and media attitudes toward Middle East
                        issues. The group will also explore ways to take advantage of the <gloss

                        available to the Israeli leadership and public opinion the viewpoints of
                        moderate Arabs, and to Arab leaders the opinions of moderate Israelis.</p>
                    <p>We foresee that we may have to ask for additional funding, beyond that
                        granted in the Mid-year Program Review. We are particularly interested in
                        expanding activity in the exchange of persons field, and we are working with

                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">timing of a decision</hi>. Can the question of USIA/CU
                        organization be put to the President soon, or should it be deferred for
                        further study? Deferral is not taken to be a serious possibility, with

                        and the Administration on record to Congress with the promise of a plan. If
                        you want to try to put the horse before the cart, it will take a major
                        effort, probably a memo to the President arguing that reorganization should
                        not be pulled out of the air but rather follow a careful look at <hi
                            rend="italic">what</hi> the U.S. wants to do, and why.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">should <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss

                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">can we build a searching review of programs into the

                        programs; indeed it might distract attention from them. If you choose not to

                        recommend that as part of any consolidation we secure agreement to an

                        group.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">how will a consolidated USIA/CU relate to the State

                        akin to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s current status—independence
                        with special links to the White House; an <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1"
                            >ACDA</gloss>-style relationship to State is another possibility.</p>

                                >VOA</gloss>.</hi> There is general agreement that <gloss

                        is about the best that can be done, that some tension between <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s desires and the comfort of State desk
                        officers is inevitable and not all bad. Still others would like to go
                        further in declaring <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s editorial

                        But I strongly believe they should be kept apart; nothing is lost by

                        following argument:</p>
                    <p>a) to maintain the status quo would cause us to lose an opportunity to
                        correct a longstanding organizational defect and to improve foreign policy
                        guidance in our information programs;</p>
                    <p>b) consolidation would simplify communication and facilitate broad program
                        operations involving both exchange of persons and media products;</p>
                    <p>c) the various information activities complement one another, and to fragment
                        them would result in weakened programs and less effective coordination;</p>
                    <p>d) an independent <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> would make difficult
                        effective guidance by State and would “aggravate” the present tendency of
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> to act outside of established
                        policy;</p>
                    <p>e) in an <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>-like relationship it would be
                        easier to integrate the conduct of public diplomacy with traditional
                        diplomacy, and to achieve greater efficiency in our international
                        information and cultural operational activities.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> argues that the risks (such as
                        possible reduction in the Department’s influence over the exchange program
                        and greater congressional resistance to funding exchanges) would be
                        minimized if <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programs were brought
                        into a new relationship with the Department, comparable to that of <gloss

                        organizational and budgetary autonomy to that extent would be

                        <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s is an argument for greater
                        central direction and control of “public diplomacy” activities. It does not

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Introduction</p>
                    <p>Regular readers of the annual reports of the U.S. Advisory Commission on
                        International Educational and Cultural Affairs will have detected over the
                        years a similarity of theme in their introductions. In one way or another,
                        with degrees of intensity ranging from mild observation to indignant
                        accusation, they have pointed out that the importance of international
                        educational and cultural exchange to our foreign policy has never been
                        adequately recognized—particularly in terms of appropriations.</p>
                    <p>The successive Commissions have had their “up” moments and their “down”
                        moments on this subject. Thus the Commission’s first report, issued in April
                        1963, was appropriately entitled <hi rend="italic">A Beacon of Hope</hi>;
                        its sixth report, however, issued in 1969, was plaintively titled <hi
                            rend="italic">Is Anyone Listening</hi>; and the title of its eleventh,
                            <hi rend="italic">A Necessary and a Noble Task</hi>, issued in 1975,
                        managed to convey at one and the same time hope and despair.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d76fn2">Copies of the previous annual reports are ibid.</note>
                        Though the titles and the tones of the reports have changed, the underlying
                        theme has almost always been that the beacon of hope represented by
                        international exchange has not penetrated the surrounding darkness as deeply
                        as it should have.</p>
                    <p>The three reports with which members of the present Commission have been
                        associated reflect the up-and-down spirits of their predecessors. Our <hi

                        rise in appropriations for the State Department’s programs (from $31,425,000

                        an interdependent world, stated optimistically:</p>
                    <quote>As acceptance of this reality has grown, so too has recognition of the

                    <p>A year later we were less sanguine about the growing acceptance of the

                    <quote>There were during the year a good many developments in our relations with
                        other countries to suggest that perhaps the growing interdependence of the
                        world, on which we insisted so strongly in our <hi rend="italic">Eleventh
                            Report</hi>, had fallen victim to renascent nationalisms . . .</quote>
                    <p>On the second point it noted with alarm that the 1976 appropriation for the
                        Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (<gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss>) of the State Department of $55 million meant in practical
                        terms, because of increasing costs, a substantial reduction in the size of
                        the exchange program. We estimated that an appropriation of $90 million
                        would be required to sustain a program at the 1966 level—and by implication
                        recommended funding in at least that amount.</p>
                    <p>Now, one year later, we still feel that the <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss> budget is too small and have stated our belief that it
                        should be increased. The Chairman spoke for the Commission when he testified
                        as follows on February 28, 1977, before the House Subcommittee of the
                        Committee on Appropriations:</p>
                    <quote>My purpose in appearing here today is to support the appropriation
                        request of the Department of State for the Bureau of Educational and
                        Cultural Affairs in the amount of $70,500,000 for the next fiscal year. It
                        is my considered opinion that the work of this Bureau is of vital importance
                        to the resolution of some of the complex political problems which the United
                        States faces in its relations with other countries. My experience as
                        Director of the United States Information Agency [1965–69], and my relations
                        with the Department of State during the past several years as Chairman of
                        the Advisory Commission have convinced me that cultural and educational
                        exchange is an indispensable aid to the achievement of our foreign policy
                        objectives.</quote>
                    <p>Our first recommendation in this <hi rend="italic">Thirteenth Report</hi> is
                        that the Congress appropriate as a minimum for the exchange program the
                        $70.5 million which the Office of Management and Budget (<gloss
                            target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss>) has authorized the Department to
                        request.</p>
                    <p>But once again we feel encouraged to believe that the importance of “public
                        diplomacy,” of which international exchange is an important part, is gaining
                        the recognition it deserves in our foreign policy. We do not believe that
                        this is a partisan development attributable solely to a change in
                        Administrations; and yet it is true that the new Administration appears
                        ready to breathe new life into the exchange program. Here are the main
                        reasons why we are once more optimistic.</p>
                    <pb n="225" facs="0274" xml:id="pg_225"/>
                    <p>• The appropriation situation is promising. The House has authorized an
                        appropriation of $75.5 million, the Senate $80.5 million. The House
                        Appropriations Committee has, disappointingly, reported out a recommendation
                        for only $66.5 million; but the Senate Appropriations Committee has not yet
                        been heard from. When these disparities are ironed out, we trust that the
                        Department will receive, as we have recommended, all (or more than) it has
                        requested.</p>
                    <p>• Organizational problems which have hampered the operation of our
                        international cultural programs appear on the way to resolution. The
                        Commission called attention to these in March 1975 in a report which it
                        instigated, <hi rend="italic">International Information, Education</hi> and
                            <hi rend="italic">Cultural Relations: Recommendations for the

                            >Murphy</persName> Commission focused attention on them in its report,

                    <quote>The ability of this country to make its views prevail and its policies
                        succeed will derive less from its wealth and power, and more from such
                        respect and support as the rest of the world accords to its values and
                        purposes; however, neither foreign policy advocacy nor the building of
                        long-range understanding between the United States and other nations is now
                        being handled with full effectiveness.</quote>
                    <p>Now the new Administration has made it clear that it intends to tackle the
                        problem. The General Accounting Office has prepared for Congress a detailed
                        analysis of the former report.<note n="4" xml:id="d76fn4">See <ref

                        to the Department’s appropriation bill has precipitated action in the
                        Senate; and in the House, hearings have begun on the various reorganization
                            proposals.<note n="5" xml:id="d76fn5">See <ref target="#d49fn2">footnote

                    <p>• Public awareness of, and support for, international exchange, have
                        continued to mount. There is abundant evidence of this interest, none more
                        striking than the media coverage accorded to the symposium held last May in
                        Washington to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the “<persName

                            >Carter</persName> himself has, in word and deed, demonstrated a
                        commitment to the principle and the practice of international exchange which
                        must set the tone for his Administration. It was characteristic of him that
                        in his inaugural speech he addressed not only his fellow Americans but also
                        “citizens of the world,” on the theme of shaping “a world order that is more
                        responsive to human operations.”<note n="7" xml:id="d76fn7">The text of the

                        Subsequently he gave proof that these were not idle words by, for example:
                        his vigorous personal participation in cultural events; his clear emphasis
                        on the place human rights will play in the formation of U.S. foreign policy;
                        his espousal of a “Friendship Force” which would extend to thousands of
                        Americans the people-to-people experience he himself had found so
                            useful.<note n="8" xml:id="d76fn8">See <ref target="#d7">Document
                                7</ref>.</note> Above all the Commission is encouraged by his
                        promise to the Organization of American States (<gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                            >OAS</gloss>), quoted later in this report, that “we plan to explore
                        with your governments new people-to-people programs, an increase in
                        professional and scientific exchanges, and other ways of strengthening the
                        ties that already link us.” It is again characteristic of the President that
                        scarcely 6 weeks after making this promise he sent Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CR_1">Carter</persName> to Latin America to, as he put it,

                        leaders ways in which we can cooperate most effectively to advance
                            them.”<note n="9" xml:id="d76fn9">See <ref target="#d52fn2">footnote 2,

                    </p>
                    <p>The Commission naturally welcomes the Administration’s apparent intention to
                        accord educational and cultural exchange a more prominent role in the
                        conduct of foreign affairs and is eager to cooperate in the ways envisaged
                        by its enabling legislation.</p>
                    <p>The Commission’s observations and recommendations on subjects which have
                        concerned it during the past year—and for several previous years—are
                        summarized in Chapter 1 (Summary and Recommendations) and Chapter III
                        (Report on Activities) of this report. In Chapter <pb n="227" facs="0276"
                            xml:id="pg_227"/>V (The Future of the Commission), it has recommended a

                        them.</p>

                        Commission will do more than provide a record of a year’s activity. We hope,

                        ways in which the Commission can make a real contribution to an important
                        aspect of U.S. foreign policy—one to which the new Administration has wisely

                    <p>“As currently constituted, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has a
                        two-fold legislative mandate: (1) to explain U.S. official policies and (2)
                        to project American society. To ensure that this mandate is effectively
                        interpreted and applied, the Director has established basic guidelines for
                        Agency programming, both in the field and in Washington. He has directed
                        that Agency managers—at all levels, in Washington and abroad—apply the
                            guide<pb n="228" facs="0277" xml:id="pg_228"/>lines immediately to the
                        current country plan and <gloss target="#t_ZBB_1">ZBB</gloss> reviews. These
                        guidelines are:</p>
                    <p>“1. The purpose of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> country programs is
                        to support U.S. policy objectives. These objectives will be based on only
                        two sources: issues defined in the mission <gloss target="#t_PARM_1"
                            >PARM</gloss> and worldwide priority subjects specifically approved by
                        the Director. No other policy objectives exist for the purposes of
                        programming. <gloss target="#t_PARM_1">PARM</gloss> objectives to which a
                        post addresses itself are to be reworded in the country plan as public
                        affairs objectives.</p>
                    <p>“2. Programming not addressed specifically to policy issues (‛policy
                        explication’) will be designed to strengthen audience perceptions of
                        significant trends, enduring strengths and values in American society. This
                        programming, too, must be demonstrably relevant to the stated objectives of
                        each post.</p>
                    <p>“3. A country program, and each of its constituent parts, require a clear-cut
                        rationale, articulated in terms of (1) <gloss target="#t_PARM_1"
                            >PARM</gloss> objectives, (2) global guidance from the director and (3)
                        an analysis of the points of communications tension between the U.S. and
                        host country. Program rationales are subject to constant challenge by
                        management at all levels. The question is not ‛what are we doing,’ but ‛what
                        are we attempting to accomplish and why?’</p>
                    <p>“4. Programs and projects must be clearly relevant to the promotion of <gloss
                            target="#t_PARM_1">PARM</gloss>-identified U.S. interests in the host
                        country or global guidelines from the Director. Programs and projects will
                        not be undertaken simply because they are within our capability. A related
                        question is whether we are trying to accomplish too much, and therefore
                        accomplishing less than we might if our resources were more highly
                        focused.</p>
                    <p>“5. All locally produced programming will meet all of the criteria stated
                        herein. The totality of programs will be in a balance appropriate to public
                        affairs priorities.</p>
                    <p>“6. Country plans should continue to be based on present audience
                        definitions.</p>
                    <p>“7. The post’s rationale and post activities presuppose an understanding of
                        the host country influence structure.</p>
                    <p>“8. The country plan, once approved, will govern program decisions and
                        resource commitments throughout the year. It is a ‛living’ document, not a
                        candidate for consignment to the files, and will be the basis for all
                        judgments on a post’s program rationale and activities.</p>
                    <p>“Area offices will be responsible for drafting, in consultation with <gloss
                            target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss>, a response to each current country plan
                        submission. The responses will convey judgments on each country plan
                        submission in the light of these guidelines. The message will be reviewed
                        and signed by the Deputy Director.</p>
                    <p>“Where, in the judgment of an area Assistant Director, the current country
                        plan submission does not reflect these guidelines, posts will <pb n="229"
                            facs="0278" xml:id="pg_229"/>be required to submit a new plan which will
                        be due in Washington by cable not later than September 1.</p>
                    <p>“Allocations of <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1978 funds in Washington
                        and at overseas posts will be based on these submissions.” (End
                        guidelines)</p>
                    <p>It is our intention, in the course of the next planning cycle, to meld our
                            <gloss target="#t_ZBB_1">ZBB</gloss>-country plan processes and to
                        relate both more closely to the State Department’s <gloss target="#t_PARM_1"
                            >PARM</gloss> process. This will result in more productive programming
                        while lightening the paper load on you and on us.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday afternoon you focussed on my comment about the political fluidity
                        in Europe and questioned how the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                        presence could affect it. Our presence and activities probably cannot affect
                        it materially. This instability is one of the more important elements of the
                        environment in which we operate. The reason I stressed this point was to
                        illustrate that even in this economically and socially advantaged region
                        there is no guarantee of stability or even constancy of purpose. Therefore,
                        one major <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> role is to constantly
                        reinforce the U.S. interest and relationship to Europe.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d78fn2">On another copy of the memorandum, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> underlined “constantly
                            reinforce the U.S. interest and relationship to Europe” and placed a
                            question mark in the left-hand margin next to this sentence.
                            (Ibid.)</note> No matter what political developments ensue, a firm
                        foundation for the U.S. connection is vital to our interests. The U.S. (and
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>) presence and activities with
                        elites help to focus and confirm the broad political and strategic framework
                        within which political events develop.</p>

                        non-military supports as economic ties, as our direct security role is
                        perceived to decline” (p. 3)</p>

                    <p>These are but a few extracts which support this theme, but read together with
                        the <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> speech and other policy
                        statements, which can be supplied, I don’t think there should be any serious
                        doubt that this Administration believes shoring up the confidence of East
                        Asians in America’s long-term staying power and positive involvement in the
                        area is real and necessary.</p>
                    <p>This is not to say that our continued involvement will be in the same form as
                        it existed before Viet Nam fell. That, obviously, is not the case, but that
                        also is another issue.</p>
                    <p>I trust you don’t mind this effort at policy explication.</p>

                        broadcasts.</p>
                    <p>Since 1973, we have hoped that improving U.S.-Chinese relations would lead to
                        the end of <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> jamming of these broadcasts.
                        To date, however, the jamming continues.</p>
                    <p>The point could be made that no other country now jams <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts. The Soviets ceased doing so in
                        1973. The U.S. has always considered jamming an unfriendly act; its
                        cessation would mark a significant improvement in our relationship with the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. Moreover, frequent Western press
                        accounts cite the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> as the only country
                        which currently jams the Voice, a fact which damages the image that Peking
                        seems to wish to cultivate internationally.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Chinese language broadcasts—like those
                        directed to other countries—consist of a comprehensive and authoritative
                        report of international and U.S. news, of news analyses and other
                        news-related materials (such as U.S. and international editorial round-ups)
                        and Americana features, including English teaching and music.</p>
                    <p>Since the U.S. continually protests Soviet interference with the free flow of
                        information, failure to raise this issue with the Chinese could leave the
                        Administration vulnerable to charges of inconsistency, both from the Soviets
                        and from the Congress, should the question be raised in connection with
                        public debate on the conduct of our relations with China.</p>

                        rebroadcast it in prime time to all areas of the world. The speech was also
                        broadcast in full in Russian and major Soviet languages. Other language
                        services broadcast extensive excerpts. Followups were provided with
                        correspondent reports and an analysis of the key points in the speech.</p>
                    <p>Copies of the speech were sent by <gloss target="#t_WirelessFile_1">Wireless
                            File</gloss> to all posts and a <gloss target="#t_VTR_1">VTR</gloss> was
                        produced of the entire speech, especially for <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> Moscow and Leningrad and also made available
                        worldwide.</p>
                    <p>Copies were also given to resident foreign correspondents in Washington and
                        New York who were invited to our press centers to hear the speech live.</p>
                    <p>Looking ahead, we have and will continue to urge all media to maximize the
                        key points in the speech. We told the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s
                        of the importance of the speech, urged that they bring it to the attention
                        of the Chiefs of Mission and insure maximum dissemination among key
                        audiences.</p>

                    <p>To back up our posts, we will proceed along the following lines here during

                    <p>The Voice of America has asked its overseas correspondents to file reports

                        reaction will be used in opinion roundups. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> is also considering a “Press Conference <gloss

                    <p>Our press service is preparing an analytical article on the speech and will
                        do a discussion piece interviewing Soviet experts. We are considering the

                    </p>
                    <p>1. In general, public diplomacy of the new administration in this area has
                        been effective. New policies have been enunciated clearly in statements by
                        high level officials and such statements and backgrounds have been given
                        timely dissemination through <gloss target="#t_WirelessFile_1">Wireless
                            File</gloss> and Departmental messages. This has been effectively
                        supplemented by items available through alerts system, by <gloss
                            target="#t_VTR_1">VTR</gloss>’s and by visiting speakers.</p>
                    <p>2. We still have two problems which require continuing attention in our
                        public diplomacy: our posture in East Asia and human rights.</p>
                    <pb n="236" facs="0285" xml:id="pg_236"/>
                    <p>3. We still face deeply implanted and persistent feeling that new
                        administration is “withdrawing” or, at least, “reducing priority” in East
                        Asia. This remains conventional wisdom here in Indonesia despite visitors
                        from new administration, significant statements such as Secretary’s Asia

                            For the White House statement released at the conclusion of these talks,
                            see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: Carter, 1978</hi>, Book II, pp.

                        various forms of aid for Indonesia. I confess I am baffled by phenomenon.
                        Fact is it exists and will continue to require, on our part, reiteration of
                        our interest and maximum of attention to area through visits and concrete
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>4. Full appreciation for President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName>’s broad and sympathetic interest in human dignity and
                        basic rights is hampered by feeling that our approach to this issue: (1) is
                        accusatory; (2) seeks to implant American models on other societies; and (3)
                        fails to recognize special needs of developing societies. Clear presentation
                        of administration views is complicated by fact clear distinction is not made
                        in local public mind between official expressions, congressional views, and
                        views of non-official human rights organizations. In order to put our
                        intentions into clearer focus, we may need to consider somewhat greater
                        emphasis on themes that: (1) we are not promoting a system; we are promoting
                        an attitude which respects each human being and his needs and rights; and
                        (2) we recognize that with basic rights go basic responsibilities of any
                        individual toward others in his society and the welfare of that society.</p>

                        witnesses on issues related to reorganization of public diplomacy

                        Subcommittee received more than a score of additional unsolicited statements
                        for inclusion in the hearing record.</p>
                    <p>Based on the hearing record, the Subcommittee has reached the following
                        general conclusions.</p>
                    <p>1. The key to effective use of our public diplomacy resources is an awareness
                        of the utility of these resources and a willingness to use them to further
                        policy objectives. Reorganization is important, but only of marginal concern
                        in dealing with this basic problem.</p>
                    <p>2. The head of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> (or successor
                        agency) should be included in <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> and
                        Cabinet meetings. Participation by the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> Director will (a) substantially increase opportunities for
                        maximum effective use of public diplomacy resources, and (b) allow the
                        Agency to perform its responsibilities for explaining policy for the entire
                        government.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should not be merged into the
                        Department of State. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must work
                        closely with the Department of State. It is important that <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> or a successor bureau or agency have
                        sufficient budgetary, personnel and administrative autonomy to ensure a
                        corps of officers qualified and inspired to carry out the full range of
                        public diplomacy in our national interests. The Director of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> or his successor should be included in
                        all major policy decisions within the Department of State. Similarly, lower
                        level officials concerned with public diplomacy <pb n="238" facs="0287"
                            xml:id="pg_238"/>should be involved in all major policy formulation

                            foreign policy effort. I want to ensure that we have imaginative
                            programs in this area which are energetically managed and led. For the
                            money we spend, these are among the least costly operations of the
                            government; nevertheless, the effect can continue for years after the
                            money has been spent. When I ask for additional money for these fields,
                            I want the Congress to be able to feel confident that we are making the

                            put us in a better position to do that.” (Carter Library, White House

                        RELATIONSHIP OF THE NEW ENTITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE?</p>
                    <p>The more that public diplomacy programs should concentrate on building
                        overseas support for current American policies, the closer to State (in
                        terms of both policy guidance and organizational location) any new entity
                        should be. To the extent that public diplomacy should concentrate upon
                        enhancing a broader mutual understanding, the more distance from State is
                        appropriate.</p>
                    <p>So long as the budget and operations of the new entity are separate from
                        those of State, its formal relationship to State is likely to matter less
                        than the strength of its leadership and the degree of interest shown by the
                        Secretary of State. Even so, the acceptability of consolidation to the
                        Congress, the agencies, and the interested public will be affected by
                        questions of form. Accordingly, there has been considerable discussion among
                        the participants in developing this memorandum as to whether the
                        relationship of a consolidated entity to State should approximate that

                    <p>The question of whether <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s news
                        operations should enjoy the same independence as those of private

                        and interested outsiders. (There has been less controversy as to the
                        propriety of State’s giving guidance where analysis and commentary are
                        concerned.) Some have argued that as a U.S. Government radio station, <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> inevitably is taken by overseas listeners
                        to represent official U.S. policy, and that therefore, its broadcasting

                        official U.S. policy. Thus, in March 1975, State and <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> prevailed upon <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> not to carry the story of student demonstrations in Phnom
                        Penh calling for Lon Nol’s removal because of the “possibility” that the
                        broadcasting of such a news story “could be misconstrued as a signal that
                        the U.S. Government was sympathetic to those demands.” Similarly, in October
                        1976, the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv forbade a <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> correspondent to check the veracity of a news story with a
                        Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman because the U.S. does not

                    <p>Those opposing this view take the position that we best demonstrate our

                        to see any officer of the Department. Nothing ever came of my call or note

                    </p>
                    <p>The “<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Human Rights Action Proposals”
                        were extremely well received in the field. With few exceptions, <gloss
                            target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> assessed the objectives, themes and
                        treatment sections of the proposals as well presented, balanced and
                        realistic in the context of local program options and plans. While posts
                        were generally receptive to and encouraged by the wide range of “global
                        products” and projects mentioned in the proposals, their stated preferences
                        for some products and projects over others were related to human rights
                        sensitivities in the host countries and program options perceived by the
                        posts.</p>
                    <p>The projects and processes suggested by <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss>
                        indicate that they are attuned to the individual country human rights
                        situation and the most logical and effective direction for policy
                        explication and public diplomacy efforts in the human rights field.</p>
                    <p>The impressive list of <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> suggestions for
                        media products, programs and Agency initiatives will be of significant value
                        in developing plans and programs that are fully responsive to post
                        requirements.</p>
                    <p>Recommendations for programs that other agencies might undertake include

                        effective complementary programs.</p>

                    <p>This report does not include each post suggestion or comment, but is designed
                        to be representative of the range and emphasis of <gloss target="#t_PAO_1"

                            treatment sections of the draft proposals. Is the overall balance within
                            each of these sections right? What do they imply for programs at your
                            post?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Overall, <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> evaluate the objectives,
                        themes and treatment sections as comprehensive, well balanced and realistic
                        in approach.</p>
                    <p>Recurring themes in <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> comments are (a) the
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> human rights proposals represent
                        a new and positive direction for Agency programming; and (b) the proposals’
                        implications for a prominent <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> role in
                        policy explication and public diplomacy are encouraging.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="italic">Objectives section</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>—Universality of human rights should be the “kingpin” of objectives.</p>
                    <p>—We should present the U.S. as dedicated to the fair application and
                        observance of human rights globally, but within various national
                        contexts.</p>
                    <p>—Problems may be experienced in implementing objective three—“Providing
                        support and encouragement, where appropriate, to individuals and groups
                        abroad who are actively involved in promoting human rights.” In selected
                        countries human rights activists are regarded as being in opposition to
                        government policies (a view held more by government leaders, but not as
                        often by the populace.) In these countries <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> efforts to contact and offer encouragement to human rights
                        activists could be exploited adversely by various factions within or outside
                        the government, and thus prove counterproductive to our public diplomacy
                        efforts.</p>
                    <p>This concern lends credence to the “where appropriate” caveat in objective
                        three—which presupposes that initiatives to contact human rights activists
                        may not be prudent in certain countries.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="italic">Themes and treatment section</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>—We should add a theme which directly associates the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss> with human rights. Suggested wording is: “All <gloss
                            target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> members, by virtue of their membership in
                        that body, have a moral obligation to provide and protect basic human rights
                        of their citizens.” The purpose of this theme is to provide an international
                        basis for promoting human rights.</p>
                    <p>—We should add another theme which is responsive to allegations that we are
                        trying to force our traditions and values upon other nations and cultures.
                        Suggested wording is: “The human rights policy of the Administration
                        reflects a firm belief that the inherent dignity of man, <pb n="250"
                            facs="0299" xml:id="pg_250"/>as outlined in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss> Charter, is a universal truth that transcends boundaries of
                        nationality, race, culture, custom, creed and politics.”</p>
                    <p>—Recommend number 6 in the treatment section be revised to give greater
                        emphasis to the relationship of economic rights and goals in the human
                        rights equation and be supplemented to provide guidance as to the nature of
                        this emphasis.</p>
                    <p>—Post human rights planning for programs should start with a clear
                        understanding of local human rights perceptions.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Usefulness of Washington produced “global” products and
                            projects mentioned in the plan to your specific country program. Do you
                            have any further suggestions for products that would be useful to
                            you?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>While “global” products and projects are generally well received by <gloss
                            target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> their assessments of products and
                        projects varied country by country. Variables influencing the degree of
                        utility and value of products and projects are the prevailing local human
                        rights situation, the sensitivities of the government to human rights and
                        the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss>’ perceived range of program
                        options.</p>
                    <p>“Global Products” reported as useful in most countries include articles and
                            <gloss target="#t_VTR_1">VTRs</gloss> on official human rights policy
                        statements by the President, secretary of state and other administration
                        officials. However, these same products were reported to have only limited
                        value at other posts.</p>
                    <p>Overall, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> proposed “projects” were
                        assessed as realistic and generally representative of the kinds of proven
                        techniques and processes—media materials, <gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss>
                        grants, speakers—which any serious international communications effort
                        should include. Again, enthusiasm for individual projects varied country by
                        country with preference for selected projects being made on the basis of
                        past experience with similar projects or their perceived utility. For
                        example, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Belgrade noted that only
                        well-done commercial programs such as the recent <gloss target="#t_NBC_1"
                            >NBC</gloss> documentary<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d67fn14">footnote 14, Document 67</ref>.</note> and special
                        on human rights have proved programmable.</p>
                    <p>The utility of “global products” and proposed projects varies with the
                        medium. For example, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Tokyo reports
                        that timely videotapes and full texts of speeches are always usable.
                        However, background articles in English and <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> English broadcasts are somewhat less useful.</p>

                        suggested that it would be premature to hold such a conference pending the

                        around the world. It was suggested that this service might be provided more

                    <p>—We should identify public and private American leaders in the human rights

                    <p>—Where appropriate, we should develop programs which encourage freedom of

                        does not mean we would encourage opposition to local governments, but rather
                        we should play an active role as “patron of the arts” in encouraging young

                        to RFE on human rights.</p>
                    <p>—State/<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> should develop more multi-regional

                    <p>—Fellowships and seminars on the study of democratic institutions are
                        suggested. It is in Western democracies where human rights flourish. The
                        propogation of those democratic ideals should be pushed as if our survival

                        would be extremely valuable in helping field posts to prepare nominations

                    <p>—Based on the model of the Department’s Senior Seminar in Foreign Policy,

                        issues and to meet U.S. officials and others involved in the human rights
                        field.</p>

                    <p>In a joint press statement issued on September 1, 1977, Director of the

                            Reinhardt</persName> and Acting Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren Christopher</persName> announced the
                        reorganization of U.S. public diplomacy activities, following President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName>’s approval of
                        consolidating the Department of State’s educational and cultural exchange
                        activities and the United States Information Agency’s information and
                        cultural activities in a “new organizational entity” (see <ref target="#d85"
                            >Document 85</ref>). The statement outlined the procedures for
                        establishing a new agency, discussed the process by which the President had
                        reached his decision, and specified a time table for submitting the
                        reorganization plan to Congress. It also specified the goals of the new
                        agency:</p>
                    <p>“—Reflect accurately to other peoples and governments the values of our
                        society;</p>
                    <p>“—Convey the diversity of thought and cultural vitality of the United
                        States;</p>
                    <p>“—Insure that other countries know where this country stands and why;</p>
                    <p>“—Assist Americans to understand the intellectual and cultural wealth and
                        diversity of other countries;</p>
                    <p>“—Forge relationships between Americans and others that can contribute to
                        mutual understanding and the capacity to cooperate in solving common
                        problems;</p>
                    <p>“—Provide the President and Secretary of State with accurate assessments of
                        foreign opinion on important issues; and</p>
                    <p>“—Seek to reduce barriers to the international exchange of ideas and

                            III</persName> discussed the joint statement and indicated that he would

                        any great surprises” in the joint statement and then took questions:</p>
                    <p>“Q. As I understand it, at least technically the Secretary of State will be
                        in charge of the Voice of America. However, you have formed <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> into a new agency and pulled that agency
                        into the State Department.</p>
                    <p>“A. Yes.</p>
                    <p>“Q. And I wondered how that would guarantee independent news broadcasts,
                        since <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> now, since I understand it, isn’t
                        answerable to any policy-makers outside the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>“A. Well, the relationship, of course, has always been that we have given
                        advice on policy matters.</p>
                    <p>“Q. The State Department has always given advice?</p>
                    <p>“A. Yes, the State Department gives advice on policy matters in any case to
                        the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>. I do not think that it
                        substantially changes in its structural form that relationship.</p>
                    <p>“Q. Well, has that advice ever gone to the point of telling them what to
                        broadcast and what not to broadcast?</p>
                    <p>“A. I don’t think that the question of prior censorship comes up.</p>
                    <p>“Q. What about post censorship? How about post recriminations?</p>
                    <p>“A. What am I going to tell you?</p>
                    <p>“Q. Garbled.</p>
                    <p>“A. What I am going to tell you is very obvious. There have been times where
                        there have been questions raised in the past about <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss>. I mean, that is a matter of record in fact.</p>
                    <p>“Q. But at least, if you will accept that there are murmurings within <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> that there will now be some interference
                        from the State Department that didn’t exist in the past.</p>
                    <p>“A. I would find that to be not in keeping with what is intended in this,
                        that there will be some new level of interference. In fact, it seems to me
                        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> has made it very
                        clear that the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>, within the general fact
                        that it operates under <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is going to be
                        allowed to use independence, free from outside interference.</p>
                    <p>“Q. What makes it more independent?</p>
                    <p>“A. Wait a minute. I am not suggesting that it is more independent beyond
                        what—by this reorganization—beyond what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1"
                            >Reinhardt</persName> himself has already put out in the Agency.</p>
                    <p>“Let me say that insofar as the total details of this reorganization plan are
                        concerned, that is going to be included in the broader reorgani<pb n="256"
                            facs="0305" xml:id="pg_256"/>zation proposal which the President is
                        going to be forwarding, and I am just not prepared to go into great
                        specificity on it because of that, but insofar as the major concern of the
                        debate that I have seen in the past, i.e., the <persName corresp="#p_SF_1"
                            >Stanton</persName> Report and others, clearly the <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is not being spun out, it is being
                        retained.</p>
                    <p>“Q. What I am asking you is somewhat different. If it is to have a
                        relationship similar to <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>’s
                        relationship to the State Department, I am unaware that <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> has an independent policy relationship
                        to the State Department. Therefore I do not see how the Voice of America can
                        have an independent policy relationship.</p>
                    <p>“A. Well, the budget and the personnel system are independent. The form of
                        our participation is clearly going to be on the policy line in trying to
                        make sure that policy is understood. It has nothing to do with those
                        handling the news. It has to do however, with the accurate transmittal of
                        U.S. policy. That has been the way it has been. I mean, that clear[ly] is an
                        interest. It is a U.S. agency in that respect.”</p>
                    <p>After answering additional questions concerning the Voice of America,
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> responded to a question
                        regarding the <persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName> Report and
                        support for its recommendations:</p>
                    <p>“I can’t speak officially as to how much support it had. It is not my
                        understanding that it had a great deal of backing in the deliberations that
                        went on in intergovernmental—it was certainly considered very carefully,
                        however. It and the <persName corresp="#p_MJT_2">Murphy</persName> Report

                    <p>Just as your letter of August 29<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">See <ref

                        announced his decision to combine the functions of the Bureau of Educational
                        and Cultural Affairs and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Information
                        Agency into a new, single agency, which would also include the Voice of

                            <persName corresp="#p_SPL_1">Peter Szanton</persName> of the President’s
                        Reorganization Project called you shortly thereafter to inform you of the
                        President’s decision.</p>
                    <p>I believe the President’s decision provides a rational and workable approach
                        to the management of our international information and cultural programs. I
                        believe, too, that some of the important philosophical concerns raised by
                        the Panel under your chairmanship will be met in the reorganization plan.
                        For example, the plan will include measures to insure the independence of
                        the news function of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>. We also intend to
                        make sure that the integrity of educational and cultural exchanges will be
                        fully protected in the new agency.</p>
                    <p>I intend to do all that I can to help bring into being a new organization
                        that has credibility in this country and abroad. I look forward to your help
                        and advice in the crucial period ahead.</p>

                            subordination of authority: “‛Agency for International Communication’,
                            which seems to be, would be acceptable, if it were prefaced with United
                            States—making acronym ‛USAIC’ (U.S.-Ache). They are dealing with problem
                            of subordination of the agency by language ‛under the direction of the
                            Secretary of State and the President.’ I suggested President be

                    </p>
                    <p>—The name proposed for the new agency is atrocious. We propose that it be
                        called the United States Information and Cultural Agency or the United
                        States Information and Cultural Exchange Agency. To call the new agency the
                        International Communications and Exchange Agency makes it sound like a stock
                        exchange. We prefer the name United States Information and Cultural Agency
                        because it is more high sounding and less political and ideological in
                        overtone. It is not a communications agency which refers to technical
                        communications but rather it is an information agency to inform the world of
                        U.S. policy <pb n="260" facs="0309" xml:id="pg_260"/>and goals. The agency
                        should clearly be identified with the United States, as <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has been for the past 25 years.</p>
                    <p>—The phrase in line 41, “<hi rend="italic">Under the direction</hi> of the
                        Secretary of State.” is too strong and is contrary to the sense of the
                        President’s reorganization decision, i.e., that the new agency should have a
                        relationship to State analogous to that of <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1"
                            >ACDA</gloss>. “Under the direction” implies that the agency is
                        subordinate to State, which the rest of the text does not bear out. For
                        instance, the paragraph which begins at line 186 describes a cooperative
                        relationship between State and the new agency which is not subordinate. A
                        better phrase would be “under the guidance of the Secretary of State” or “in
                        consultation with the Secretary of State.” This would better represent the
                        White House position.</p>

                    <p>1. To foster recognition of the historical and contemporary significance of
                        the American Constitution, encouraging its study as part of the curricula of
                        foreign universities, polytechnics, teacher training institutes and
                        secondary schools, seeking to implant relevant knowledge of American
                        constitutionalism into international social science curricula.</p>
                    <p>2. To strengthen understanding among appropriate foreign publics of the
                        practical impacts of the American system of separate but shared powers upon
                        American foreign policy and programs.</p>
                    <p>3. To initiate dialogue on the principles of constitutional democracy between
                        Americans and foreign counterparts concerned with studying, commenting on,
                        framing or performing official functions under, written constitutions.</p>
                    <p>4. To illuminate the achievements of constitutional democracy to nations

                        ideas.</p>
                    <p>5. To dramatize the interconnection between the U.S. Government’s current

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III—STRATEGY AND A POSSIBLE TIMETABLE</p>
                    <p>Retrospective analyses of the Revolution Bicentennial effort tend to share
                        several common conclusions:</p>
                    <p>a. The syndrome of the “Revolution Bicentennial hangover” cannot be blinked
                        away. After such a sustained period of fevered activism, one can expect
                        neither Americans nor foreigners to maintain the same intense interest and
                        energy level for the Constitutional observance—at least not without a
                        pause.</p>
                    <p>b. The Constitutional commemoration will not lend itself to the mass hoopla
                        of the Revolution Bicentennial but rather to the selective and focussed
                        programming with which the Agency is doctrinally most comfortable.</p>

                    <p>d. The new coordinating mechanism for the Constitution celebration should not
                        be involved in operations but confined to planning and
                        grant-administration.</p>
                    <p>e. Planning should not be over-centralized; inputs from a wide spectrum of
                        institutions, public and private, are crucial to success.</p>
                    <p>f. Domestic and foreign dimensions of the Constitutional observances should
                        not be overly compartmentalized. What ought to be sought, over the long run,
                        is a broad interflow of ideas and inputs between <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> and other agencies and ultimately between Americans and

                        <hi rend="italic">November 1, 1977:</hi> It is highly desirable that the
                        White House, as the leadership center of the government, should call the
                        first organizational meeting for intra-governmental cooperation on the
                        Constitution Bicentennial. This act would reduce the vexing problem of
                        territoriality which may arise if another Federal executive agency should be
                        in the position of summoning its peers. All agencies with potential roles in
                        the Constitutional Bicentennial would be included: <gloss target="#t_HEW_1"
                            >HEW</gloss>, Interior, Justice, State, the National Endowment for the

                        the Supreme Court, the Judicial Conference of the U.S.A., and the <gloss

                        call such a gathering, <persName corresp="#p_HRR_1">Richard Hite</persName>,
                        the custodian of the Bicentennial’s remaining funds, could be persuaded to
                        do so. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, of course, could not properly
                        spearhead such a meeting but could play a catalytic part. Succeeding
                        meetings could meet outside the White House orbit. Conferees might elect a
                        chairman (rotating?) and then select three working committees to conduct
                        liaison with three different sectors—the Federal establishment (including
                        the Supreme Court and the Judicial Conference), private organizations, and
                        overseas. As a probable member of the international committee, <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> would be prepared to invite the
                        International Commitee of the American Studies Association to circularize
                        overseas Americanists (2,000 strong as of 1975) and seek their ideas and
                        invite outlines of ideas for Bicentennial grants. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> would coordinate also with Washington embassies such as
                        the French and the Australian so as to avoid overlaps with their national
                        celebrations coming at the end of the decade. Our posts would be encouraged
                        to add their own constructive ideas on appropriate forms of celebrating the
                        event.</p>

                    <p>—The two commissions that now advise <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        and the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs will be combined into a
                        single seven-member commission.<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">References are to
                            the U.S. Advisory Commission on Information and the U.S. Advisory
                            Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs. The merger
                            established the U.S. Advisory Commission on International
                            Communications, Cultural, and Educational Affairs.</note> Members of
                        this nonpartisan commission will be chosen from fields related to the
                        agency’s mission. The commissioners will be appointed by the President and
                        confirmed by the Senate.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this reorganization is to broaden our informational,
                        educational and cultural intercourse with the world, since this is the major
                        means by which our government can inform others about our country, and
                        inform ourselves about the rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>The new Agency for International Communication will play a central role in
                        building these two-way bridges of understanding between our people and the
                        other peoples of the world. Only by knowing and understanding each other’s
                        experiences can we find common ground on which we can examine and resolve
                        our differences.</p>
                    <p>The new agency will have two distinct but related goals:</p>
                    <p>• To tell the world about our society and policies—in particular our
                        commitment to cultural diversity and individual liberty.</p>
                    <p>• To tell ourselves about the world, so as to enrich our own culture as well
                        as to give us the understanding to deal effectively with problems among
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>As the world becomes more and more interdependent, such mutual understanding
                        becomes increasingly vital. The aim of this reorganization, therefore, is a
                        more effective dialogue among peoples of the earth. Americans—mostly
                        immigrants or the descendants of immigrants—are particularly well suited to
                        enter into such an undertaking. We have already learned much from those who
                        have brought differing values, perspectives and experiences to our shores.
                        And we must continue to learn.</p>
                    <p>Thus the new agency will lay heavy emphasis on listening to others, so as to
                        learn something of their motivations and aspirations, their histories and
                        cultures.</p>
                    <p>Several principles guided me in shaping this reorganization plan. Among the
                        most important were:</p>
                    <p>—Maintaining the integrity of the educational and cultural exchange programs
                        is imperative. To this end, the plan retains the Board of Foreign
                        Scholarships, whose strong leadership has done so much to insure the high
                        quality of the educational exchange program. In addition, I intend to
                        nominate an Associate Director who will be <pb n="269" facs="0318"
                            xml:id="pg_269"/>responsible for the administration and supervision of
                        educational and cultural functions consolidated in the new Agency. The
                        responsibilities presently exercised by the Department of State in relation
                        to the Center for Technical and Cultural Interchange Between East and West,
                        Inc., will be transferred to the new agency without alteration.</p>
                    <p>—Keeping the Voice of America’s news gathering and reporting functions
                        independent and objective. The Voice’s charter, enacted into law in 1976,
                        provides that “<gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> news will be accurate,
                        objective, and comprehensive”; that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        will “present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant
                        American thought and institutions”; and that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> will present U.S. policies “clearly and effectively, and
                        will also present responsible discussion and opinion on these
                            policies.”<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4">See <ref target="#d47fn2">footnote
                                2, Document 47</ref>.</note> Under this Administration, <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> will be solely responsible for the content
                        of news broadcasts—for there is no more valued coin than candor in the
                        international marketplace of ideas. I also plan to nominate an Associate
                        Director who will be responsible for the administration and supervision of
                        the Voice of America.</p>
                    <p>—The new agency’s activities must be straightforward, open, candid, balanced,
                        and representative. They will not be given over to the advancement of the
                        views of any one group, any one party or any one Administration. The agency
                        must not operate in a covert, manipulative, or propagandistic way.</p>
                    <p>—Rights of U.S. Information Agency and State Department employees must be
                        respected. In the new agency, their career achievements will be recognized
                        and the best possible use made of their professional skills and
                        abilities.</p>
                    <p>The Director of the new agency will assess and advise on the impact on
                        worldwide public opinion of American foreign policy decisions. The Agency
                        will coordinate the international information, educational, cultural and
                        exchange programs conducted by the U.S. Government and will be a
                        governmental focal point for private U.S. international exchange programs.
                        It will also play a leading role within the U.S. Government in our efforts
                        to remove barriers to the international exchange of ideas and
                        information.</p>
                    <p>It is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other
                        economies that will result from the proposed reorganization, and therefore I
                        do not do so. The reorganization will result in greater efficiency by
                        unifying in Washington the management of programs which are already
                        administered in a consolidated manner in the field. For example, field
                        officers will no longer report to two separate sets of supervisors and
                        headquarters at home.</p>
                    <pb n="270" facs="0319" xml:id="pg_270"/>
                    <p>This plan abolishes the functions of the Advisory Committee on the Arts
                        authorized by section 106(c) of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange
                        Act of 1961, as amended (22 <gloss target="#t_USC_1">U.S.C</gloss>.
                        2456(c)). Also abolished, as a result of the consolidation of certain
                        functions of the United States Advisory Commission on Information and the
                        United States Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural
                        Affairs in the United States Advisory Commission on International
                        Communication, Cultural and Educational Affairs, are the functions
                        authorized by section 603 of the United States Information and Educational
                        Exchange Act of 1948, as amended (22 <gloss target="#t_USC_1">U.S.C</gloss>.
                        1468) (requiring submission by the United States Advisory Commission on
                        Information of a quarterly report to the Director of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and a semiannual report to the
                        Congress). The new commission will report annually and at such other times
                        as it deems appropriate (as does the existing Advisory Commission on
                        International Educational and Cultural Affairs). Since appointments of all
                        members of the new commission will be on a nonpartisan basis, as has been
                        the case with the Advisory Commission on International Educational and
                        Cultural Affairs, the requirement of section 602(a) of the U.S. Information
                        and Educational Exchange Act (22 <gloss target="#t_USC_1">U.S.C</gloss>.
                        1467(a)) that not more than three members of the Advisory Commission on
                        Information shall be of the same political party is abolished.</p>
                    <p>Various obsolete or superseded functions under Reorganization Plan No. 8 of
                        1953 (22 <gloss target="#t_USC_1">U.S.C</gloss>. 1461 note), which created
                        the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, are superseded by this plan.
                        Finally, the Plan abolishes a provision authorizing the Secretary of State
                        to pay the expenses of transporting the bodies of participants in exchange
                        programs who die away from home, since State no longer will conduct such
                        programs (22 <gloss target="#t_USC_1">U.S.C</gloss>. 2670(e)). All functions
                        abolished by the reorganization are done so in compliance with section
                        903(b) of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
                    <p>After investigation, I have found that this reorganization is necessary to
                        carry out the policy set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United
                        States Code. The provisions in this Plan for the appointment and pay of the
                        Director, Deputy Director, and Associate Directors of the Agency have been
                        found by me to be necessary by reason of the reorganization made by the plan
                        and are at a rate applicable to comparable officers in the executive
                        branch.</p>
                    <p>In presenting this plan, I ask the support of Congress to strengthen and
                        simplify the machinery by which we carry out these important functions of
                        the United States Government.</p>
                    <p>Such action will make us better able to project the great variety and
                        vitality of American life to those abroad, and to enrich our own lives with
                        a fuller knowledge of the vitality and variety of other societies.</p>

                    <p>The new Agency for International Communication will help us demonstrate “a
                        decent respect for the opinions of mankind,” and to deal intelligently with
                        a world awakening to a new spirit of freedom.</p>

                        consolidates the functions now carried out by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> and the State Department’s Bureau of Educational and
                        Cultural Affairs into a new agency to be known as the Agency for
                        International Communication. The Plan and the President’s accompanying
                        Message are being sent to all posts via the <gloss
                            target="#t_WirelessFile_1">Wireless File</gloss>, together with a
                        collection of questions and answers. I want to point out that the Congress
                        has 60 legislative working days in which to consider the President’s Plan.
                        If the Congress does not specifically vote the Plan down within this time
                        period, the Plan automatically becomes law. Because of uncertainty as to
                        when the current session of Congress will be adjourned, we cannot know at
                        this time precisely when the 60 legislative working days will expire or,
                        should the Plan become law, precisely when the new agency would be
                        established. At best, the latter is several months into the future. We shall
                        be calling on many of you to assist us in planning the details of the
                        proposed new agency, should it come into being. In the meantime, I trust all
                        of you will remember that there is a job to be done and that you will carry
                        out your responsibilities with a renewed sense of purpose and dedication. I
                        also encourage you to look upon the President’s proposal as a challenging
                        opportunity for the future. We shall keep you as fully informed as possible
                        over the next few months. We shall be delighted to answer inquiries to the
                        best of our ability.</p>

                        <salute>Dear <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>In July I issued by telegram program guidelines for Country Plan and project
                            activities.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">See <ref target="#d77">Document
                                77</ref>.</note> Since then, it has become clear that the guidelines
                        have at best resulted in some confusion. I regret that we were not more
                        skillful drafters. Since the guidelines constitute one of the most basic
                        building blocks that we intend to put in place, clarity at the outset is
                        essential.</p>
                    <p>The misinterpretation which most concerns me accords a secondary place to our
                        legislative mandate to project American society and a primary place to our
                        mandate to explain U.S. official policies.</p>
                    <p>That is simply not the case, nor the intention. Our two legislative mandates
                        are of equal importance. My initial emphasis (in meetings with colleagues in
                        Washington) on explaining U.S. policies was meant to ensure equality of
                        treatment to this function, which, I believe, has come to be taken for
                        granted. Programs and projects in support of this purpose are sometimes
                        difficult to design. That they may require more effort does not absolve us
                        of our responsibility.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, programs to project American society are somewhat easier to
                        design. It is for this reason that I chose to emphasize the foreign policy
                        mandate. I did not and do not intend to accord the two mandates different
                        priorities. To repeat—they are of equal importance.</p>
                    <p>The guidelines deliberately state that all programs must be demonstrably
                        relevant to U.S. objectives under one mandate or the other; and also state
                        that the country program is contingent on an analysis of the points of
                        communication tension between the U.S. and the host country. Clearly, these
                        tensions differ from country to country and thus our Country Plans will
                        differ from country to country. Therefore, the balance between the programs
                        under the two mandates will <pb n="273" facs="0322" xml:id="pg_273"/>also
                        differ. It is the analysis of the tensions that will determine how much
                        programming is done under each of the mandates.</p>
                    <p>But for the Agency as a whole, the two are equal in importance. Any other
                        interpretation can only be misleading.</p>
                    <p>It is the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s responsibility to determine
                        what policies need explaining and which aspects of American society need
                        projecting and where, in the context of the local communication environment,
                        the balance lies. But to assume, at the beginning of the analytical process,
                        a different priority for the two mandates would be erroneous.</p>
                    <p>I trust this clarifies our intent.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        which resulted in a decision to use primarily American rather than mixed
                        British-American forces in the initial invasion, and to emphasize in
                        broadcasts to the area that the United States had no plans to annex or
                        control the area after the war. On the other hand, a subsequent attempt to

                        reports commissioned by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> as evidence
                        of their usefulness.</p>
                    <p>In general, the information generated by opinion polling—as with any other
                        research—is merely one of the elements considered in the decision-making
                        process. The decision-maker must inevitably balance all factors in each
                        situation and may arrive at valid decisions based on non-empirical
                        considerations. For this reason, it is difficult to determine the extent to

                        the other hand, there have been several instances when the potential
                        contribution of opinion polling among foreign populations was completely

                        not through the efforts of the bureaucracy, which he felt had little sense

                        the development and clearance of new projects indicates that understanding
                        of and support for opinion surveys is still relatively scattered within the

                    <p>Free felt that “for public opinion research to develop its full potential it
                        must go into matters deeper than ‛opinions.’ It must investigate ‛reality
                        worlds’ in general and the assumptions, often latent or implicit, upon which
                        attitudes and opinions are based.” And he felt that “for full
                        meaningfulness, the findings must be interpreted against a broader
                        background of social science data: studies of the power and influence

                    <p>The only major change in the formal situation came about as a result of a

                    <p>In 1977 the Office of Research was able, thanks to the representations of
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s new Director and Deputy
                        Director, to obtain closer working relationships with the National Security
                        Council staff. As a result, we have developed plans for a series of opinion
                        surveys in which not only are the issues defined by members of the policy
                        staff, but options for use of the results are tentatively laid out. The
                        indications to date of high-level interest in the results of these
                        polls—which we have attempted to report in the fuller kind of context
                        suggested by <persName corresp="#p_FLA_1">Lloyd Free</persName>—have been
                        gratifying.</p>
                    <p>If <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> were to be given a new mandate for
                        sensing foreign opinions of interest to U.S. Government policymakers and
                        given the staff ceiling and funding to accompany that requirement, it still
                        would have to consider some of the existing practical limitations on
                        increasing its activities abroad. Competent, reliable contractors who can
                        conduct surveys of public opinion for us exist in only some of the 115
                        countries in which we have operations. We could not quickly alter this
                        situation, or hope for others to do so. Clearances for undertaking such
                        surveys would need to be obtained from the Department of State, chiefs of
                        American diplomatic missions abroad and (in many cases) the host governments
                        concerned. In many countries this last is impossible to get. Even in
                        countries where attitude surveys are accepted in general, mission clearance
                        is often a problem. Ever since the “Camelot” debacle in Chile in 1967, many
                        if not most of our ambassadors have been queasy about the possible
                        consequences of U.S. Government-funded public opinion inquiries in the
                        countries to which they are accredited.<note n="18" xml:id="d96fn18"

                        unconvinced of the merits or need of surveys of public opinions, and perhaps
                        unaware of their impersonal character and legitimate standing, they tend to
                        err on the side of caution, an attitude which in some cases may be
                        susceptible to change by firm indications from their superiors of the
                        importance of the results of such surveys. In addition, while the
                        interviewing of respondents would be done by local contractors, designing
                        studies, awarding contracts, analyzing responses and preparing reports on
                        the results requires staff work in Washington, <pb n="279" facs="0328"
                            xml:id="pg_279"/>for which additional highly skilled professional
                        personnel would be needed if present workloads were significantly
                        increased.</p>
                    <p>Some of these obstacles to survey research can be overcome or circumvented.
                        We have experimented with using small-group panel discussions or in-depth
                        structured interviews of a relatively limited but carefully chosen group of
                        informants to provide valuable insights related to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> programming. In some cases these techniques could perhaps
                        be used to get indirect evidence of views on major issues of foreign policy,
                        even if they could not yield measures of public opinion. The example of the
                        North African invasion survey is certainly worth repeating in other
                        contexts.</p>
                    <p>We are also experimenting with getting views of people coming out of denied
                        areas such as China and Eastern Europe, whether as emigres, refugees or
                        temporary visitors, and with content analyses of published or broadcast
                        materials to give us clues behind the superficial evidence of the words as
                        they appear in newspapers or radio. And we draw upon scholars familiar with
                        an area and the literature on it to pull together information not otherwise
                        readily available. These techniques, too, are more successfully applied to
                        the assessment or planning of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        programming, but may prove worth pursuing for indications of foreign policy
                        views as well.</p>
                    <p>Basically, however, the problem of organizing, staffing, and systematizing
                        the Agency’s advisory function in response to a clearly articulated
                        policy-making need is still to be worked out.</p>

                    <p>At lunch with <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">George Vest</persName> this week,
                        I asked him what—from his perspective—he thought our most important
                        contribution in Western Europe might be.</p>
                    <p>After reflection, he responded in roughly the following way: influential
                        Europeans, whatever their responsibilities in or out of government and
                        including the intellectual community, confront a series of problems which
                        are—to them at least—novel. Some of the problems are real; some imagined;
                        but all form a “reality”. The menu of problems and their novelty are having
                        a paralytic effect on Western European societies and governments. There is
                        some danger, in these circumstances, that the Western European ship will
                        founder with a flurry of impotent hand-wringing. The most useful thing
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts could do would be to bring
                        together competent, imaginative, persuasive and inspirational American
                        thinkers and problem-solvers with homogenous or mixed groups of Western
                        Europeans—in effect, to suggest that there are ways over or around some of
                        their problems.<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWK_1">Hitchcock</persName> underlined the word
                            “their” and placed a question mark in the left-hand margin next to this
                            sentence.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>An interesting echo of this theme is contained in Athens’ telegram 9269
                        reporting on a symposium on the future of democracy.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d97fn3">Not found.</note> A separate echo came to me this
                        morning from Professor Friedmann of the American Institute at Munich. He
                        said, again roughly, that West German society and government had lost élan,
                        that there was little yeast (intellectual, moral or cultural), and therefore
                        little sense of future prospects. And finally, of course, <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJW_1">Jock Shirley</persName> went to Rome preoccupied by
                        this kind of problem in the Italian context.</p>
                    <p>It can be argued that at least some of our Western European posts are already
                        engaged in creating the kinds of problem-solving “net<pb n="281" facs="0330"
                            xml:id="pg_281"/>works” to which <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">George
                            Vest</persName> referred. I doubt, however, that we and the posts (not
                        to say <gloss target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss>) share a self-conscious, articulated strategy.</p>
                    <p>We have emerged from the last decade with remarkable vitality and élan. We
                        could share it more effectively with Western Europeans. <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is a natural instrument. The task is
                        important—perhaps more important than other things we do.</p>
                    <p>I suggest that <gloss target="#t_IEU_1">IEU</gloss> pick up this subject with
                            <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">George Vest</persName> and his
                        deputies—that is to say, at an authoritative level in <gloss
                            target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss>—and decide whether the phenomenon does
                        indeed deserve priority attention. If it does, clearly we will also need a
                        strategy shared by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> and
                        our posts. This phenomenon might, indeed, provide a basic rationale for a
                            <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> Conference.</p>
                    <p>I would be happy to involve myself in any way you believe useful.</p>

                            is the Rhodes scholarship—although we should avoid any attempt to

                    <p>The President’s trip offers a great opportunity to launch such an idea. It is
                        surprising to me that U.S. Embassies do not try to search for talented but
                        poor secondary students to help them further their education in the U.S. If
                        nothing else, the U.S. might want to consider a scholarship fund for the top
                        fifty secondary students who can’t afford a college education in each
                        developing country. This doesn’t have to be a response to the Soviets’
                        program, particularly since there is much evidence pointing to the
                        counterproductive nature of study in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>—to study there is to learn to despise the Soviet communist
                        system, not to love it. Nor should this detract from an important point
                            <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> made in their report: that we want to
                        help build the universities of the developing countries rather than train
                        their students here. <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s argument (or
                        rationalization) for not funding undergraduate education is that it will
                        “Americanize” them and increase the chances that the nation’s most talented
                        students would emigrate to the U.S., thus contributing to the “brain
                        drain.”</p>
                    <pb n="283" facs="0332" xml:id="pg_283"/>
                    <p>Certainly, we don’t want to de-nationalize the next generation of a country’s
                        leadership. But no one could argue that a four-year scholarship program for
                        fifty students will de-nationalize a country. And incentives should be
                        included to ensure that the students return to their country when their
                        education is completed. In this regard, it would make sense to launch the
                        initiative in Venezuela and to build on its experience, since it has
                        recently established an unprecedented scholarship program to train about
                        5,000 students abroad <hi rend="italic">now</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Venezuela and other middle-income countries are in a position to send their
                        young abroad, but certainly not to help the poorer countries. The initiative
                        would therefore have the advantage of using an idea and the experience of
                        the middle-income countries, but be targeted at helping the poorer
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>If you agree that this idea merits the President’s consideration, I will
                        draft a short memo for you to send to him setting out the proposal.<note

                    <p>Proposed amendments to Reorganization Plan No. 2 (Public Diplomacy) are

                            >Attached but not printed.</note> We had expected to have until November
                        11 to submit amendments, but because Congress is about to cease its regular
                        sessions and go into <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi> meetings pending
                        submission of the energy conference report, Chairman <persName
                            corresp="#p_BJB_1">Brooks</persName> has decided to act on the plan this
                        Wednesday, November 2. For this reason, any amendments must be transmitted
                        to the Congress no later than Tuesday, November 1.</p>
                    <pb n="286" facs="0335" xml:id="pg_286"/>
                    <p>The House and Senate hearings, as well as discussions with congressional
                        staff, brought forth a number of congressional concerns with the plan as
                        originally submitted. We have received a list of five proposed amendments
                        (the “Joint Recommendations”) recommended by the Senate Government Affairs
                        Committee, the Senate International Operations Subcommittee (<persName
                            corresp="#p_MGS_1">McGovern</persName>), and the House International
                        Operations Subcommittee (<persName corresp="#p_FDB_1">Fascell</persName>),
                        and two amendments recommended by Senator <persName corresp="#p_RAA_1"
                            >Ribicoff</persName> alone. We also received one recommendation from
                        Congressman <persName corresp="#p_HFJ_1">Horton</persName>. We recommend the
                        acceptance of four minor amendments that will in no way impair the
                        effectiveness of the new agency:</p>
                    <p>1. Designate one of the four Associate Directors as the “Associate Director
                        for Broadcasting” and one as the “Associate Director for Educational and
                        Cultural Affairs”. This is one of the Joint Recommendations and <persName
                            corresp="#p_BJB_1">Brooks</persName> apparently has no strong objections
                        to it. Although the amendment would determine the titles of the two
                        officials, it would not limit the functions that the Director could assign
                        to them; at the same time, it would assuage congressional and public
                        concerns about the status of the Voice of America and the educational and
                        cultural activities in the new agency.</p>
                    <p>2. Change the name of the agency from the “Agency for International
                        Communication” to the “Agency for International Understanding”. This is
                        another of the Joint Recommendations, concurred in by Chairman <persName
                            corresp="#p_BJB_1">Brooks</persName>. There has been general concern
                        over the fact that the initials of the originally proposed name (<gloss
                            target="#t_AIC_1">AIC</gloss>) spell “<gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                            >CIA</gloss>” backwards and several Members of Congress and other
                        interested parties have suggested “Agency for International Understanding”
                        as a replacement. The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff appears to
                        be the lone objector to this name.<note n="3" xml:id="d100fn3">In his

                            the new agency: “<gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> feels President
                            must request that this be changed and is going to recommend ‛Agency for

                            and could not honestly recommend it to President. Why not leave things
                            as they are?” (Carter Library, National Security Affairs, Staff

                            Box 5, Evening Reports File: 7–10/77) In a November 1 memorandum to

                                corresp="#p_HPB_1">Henze</persName> stated that <persName

                            on the reorganization plan “presents no problems for us” with the
                            exception of the proposed agency name change. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPB_1">Henze</persName> commented, “I continue to regard
                            ‛Agency for International Understanding’ as pompous, smacking of
                            Newspeak, as I gather do you. I recommend we not endorse it to the
                            President but instead propose we consider using the name already
                            suggested (‛Agency for International Communication’) but with the words
                            changed in order so that they do not spell <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> backward: i.e. <hi rend="italic">International
                                Communication Agency</hi>. This has the virtue of being simple and
                            follows the analogy of the present name: U.S. Information Agency. It
                            would abbreviate <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>, or <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>—a sensible acronym.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_DC_1">Dodson</persName> concurred, adding: “P.S.
                            ‛Information’ <hi rend="italic">translated into many languages</hi> has
                            no meaning of ‛intelligence’ I still prefer above all ‛Information

                            (Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1977, 10/11/77), Box FG 236, FG 999–7

                    <p>3. Provide that no more than four of the seven members of the advisory
                        commission may be of the same political party. <persName corresp="#p_BJB_1"
                            >Brooks</persName> concurs in this Joint Recommendation, which also
                        represents the only amendment requested by Congressman <persName
                            corresp="#p_HFJ_1">Horton</persName>. One of the existing commissions
                        being consolidated uses this formula, while the other uses the “nonpartisan”
                        formula that appears in the original version of the plan.</p>
                    <p>4. Add “labor” to the list of fields from which members of the advisory
                        commission should be drawn. This is a Joint Recommendation, concurred in by
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJB_1">Brooks</persName>. This will result in a
                        total of eight occupational areas from which the seven commission members
                        should come, but it was requested by the employee unions who testified and
                        seems harmless.</p>
                    <p>One technical amendment relating to the Director’s membership on the board of
                        the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities is also included among
                        the attached amendments.</p>
                    <p>We advise that one Joint Recommendation not be agreed to: the proposal is to
                        move the new agency farther from the control of the State Department by
                        changing the present language (providing that the Director acts “under the
                        direction of the Secretary of State”) to something limiting the Secretary’s
                        involvement to guidance or direction as to the foreign policy of the United
                        States. We oppose this recommendation for three reasons:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>first this issue was the principal point in dispute in the preparation of
                            the Presidential decision memo on public diplomacy, and you expressly
                            decided on the “under the direction” formula;</p>
                        <p>second, accepting this recommendation would arouse the academic community
                            (who feel that some closeness to State helps protect the integrity of
                            the cultural exchange programs); and</p>
                        <p>third, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_BJB_1">Brooks</persName> opposes
                            the recommendation.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>It should be noted that the testimony of Administration witnesses before
                        Congress has tended to tilt slightly in the direction of greater
                        independence from State anyway, so that accepting the congressional
                        recommendation would have little real effect operationally while causing us
                        needless trouble with <persName corresp="#p_BJB_1">Brooks</persName> and the
                        academic community.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_RAA_1">Ribicoff</persName>’s two personal
                        recommendations were that the <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2"
                            >Fulbright</persName> program and the funding of the East-West Center
                        not be transferred to the new agency, but remain in State. Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJB_1">Brooks</persName> and all the other
                        congressional participants oppose these recommendations, as do we. These
                        programs are an integral part of the activities being moved from State into
                        the new agency, and excluding them would continue in existence the
                        fragmentation of related activities that is the principal reason for this
                        reorganization. We think that <persName corresp="#p_RAA_1"
                            >Ribicoff</persName> is merely trying to respond to the individual
                        concerns of former Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName>
                        and Senator <persName corresp="#p_IDK_1">Inouye</persName>, and that there
                        is no political support in the Senate as a whole for these two
                        suggestions.</p>

                    <p>This preliminary report is based on questionnaires answered by <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> public affairs officers in 57 less
                        developed countries during August and September 1977. In most cases, <gloss
                            target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> worked with economic and political
                        officers in completing the forms. Their perceptions of the opinions of those
                        in their country professionally concerned with North-South issues or
                        personally interested in international affairs include the following:</p>
                    <p>—In most of the reporting countries, the involved and interested publics on
                        North-South issues are believed to prefer seeing U.S. resources devoted
                        primarily to projects fostering economic growth and national development,
                        rather than to programs aimed at meeting basic human needs.</p>
                    <p>—Most posts perceive relatively little support for a policy of channeling
                        officials development assistance primarily to the poorest of the <gloss
                            target="#t_LDC_1">LDCs</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—There appears to be no strong preference for multilateral over bilateral
                        aid.</p>
                    <p>—The prominence of concern over issues of trade more than questions of aid
                        suggests a view among most <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDCs</gloss> that if
                        they could obtain more favorable terms in trading with the industrialized
                        countries, other problems in North-South relations would be less
                        troublesome.</p>

                    <p>Multinational corporations have, in the opinion of posts, a mixed image among
                        groups A and B in the 57 countries. Only in a minority of countries is Group
                        A—those professionally concerned with North-South issues—believed to accept
                        the charge that multinationals exploit the natural resources of <gloss

                        their country. The larger attentive public, on the other hand, is more often
                        seen as blaming the present international economic order, their own

                    <p>I brought together the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> from the four
                        countries of the Southern Cone—Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay—on my
                        recent trip to the area in order to discuss programing relating to human

                    <p>The width of the spectrum of definition of human rights frequently has proved
                        to be an impediment to their search for increased understanding and support
                        for United States positions. The conceptual framework set by the Secretary
                        of State of there being three groups of human rights seemed to suggest a
                        potentially productive approach.<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">In telegram

                            as: “1) The right to be free from governmental violation of the

                        groups have been called “clusters” by Assistant Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName>. But during our meeting we used the
                        Helsinki terminology and called them basket one (Integrity of the Person),
                        basket two (Economic and Social Justice), and basket three (Civil and
                        Political Liberties). There was consensus that for many purposes of policy
                        explication it would be useful to confine the term “human rights” to
                        references to basket <pb n="296" facs="0345" xml:id="pg_296"/>one. This
                        would not preclude extensive programing on human rights in the basket two
                        and basket three areas, but it would dictate a more productive approach to
                        policy explication. It also would prevent defenders of offensive foreign
                        government policies from saying, as some are doing, “We have excellent
                        programs and are making measurable progress in economic and social justice
                        and, while we have for the moment non-democratic governments, there are
                        numerous civil and political liberties to which we point with pride. Since
                        that seems to make up the majority of what you Americans are talking about
                        when you say human rights, our area of dispute is only a small one over on
                        the ‛integrity of the person’ end of the scale.”</p>
                    <p>But problems of the basket one variety are everywhere. It is a revealing
                        commentary that the phrase “to disappear someone” has entered the language
                        down South.</p>
                    <p>The governments of all four countries are, to one degree or another, on the
                        outs with the United States, perceiving our approach to be all stick and no
                        carrot. Argentine Charge Max Chaplin, for example, was beset by the
                        implications of the basic, pragmatic problem of how to move President
                            <persName corresp="#p_VJR_1">Videla</persName> to action when much of
                        the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> approach puts distance between us
                        and him. The Uruguayan and Paraguayan governments are reluctant even to
                        admit they have human rights problems. The Argentine and Chilean governments
                        view threats to their institutions and general well-being as the motivation
                        for their actions. There is a widespread official belief that foreign media
                        distort situations in the Southern Cone. Any time a United States official
                        can be quoted as saying the U.S. media do not give a balanced picture of the
                        Hemisphere, governments (and others) leap upon the statement as support for
                        their positions.</p>
                    <p>The one problem thread which ran consistently through discussions of the
                        situation was the difficulty <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> have in
                        answering critics who claim the United States is following a double standard
                        in its application of sanctions on human rights violators. There is
                        considerable resentment, especially at government levels, about people’s
                        perceptions that they are being singled out by the United States.</p>
                    <p>The cultural and historical context in which human rights are viewed is
                        important in all countries. The context, in brief, has “rights” on a
                        continuum with the institutional preservation of the state, church and
                        family taking precedence over individual rights. Thus, when governments and
                        others say they don’t understand what we are talking about, they are not
                        always motivated by mere self-interest or intransigence, as they are
                        sometimes accused of in Washington.</p>
                    <p>But while it is useful to remember that governments of Southern Cone
                        countries are not the only audiences to have furrowed brows over just what
                        is meant when U.S. Government spokesmen discuss <pb n="297" facs="0346"
                            xml:id="pg_297"/>human rights, non-government audiences usually are more
                        attuned to the positive implications of the U.S. Government policy in all
                        three baskets. Media audiences are particularly important, since
                        out-of-office and opposition politicians congregate there and the media form
                        a traditional and usually not-yet-closed-off forum for debate and opposition
                        to government policies. The academic world is another key sector in which
                        there is considerable sympathy for and more constructive debate about United
                        States human rights policies in all areas. Businessmen and church leaders
                        are other audiences which offer not only promise but have been the locus of
                        some progress in post program efforts. There was unanimity that military
                        audiences should not be written off entirely as targets for <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> programing. The key to these seems to be

                    <p>Whatever <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Washington’s approach may be,
                        the overriding consideration for programing and focus is the perception of
                        the American Ambassador, who sets the tone of the Mission in all cases. The
                        most dramatic example of this has been in Uruguay, where Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_SEV_1">Siracusa</persName>’s approach to human
                        rights programing was notably different from Ambassador Pezzullo’s.</p>

                        established, brings <pb n="298" facs="0347" xml:id="pg_298"/>the <gloss

                        audiences. Both in policy and in societal projection, <gloss

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Themes:</p>
                    <p>Because of the possible confusion between human rights “baskets” and Helsinki
                        “baskets,” I recommend scrapping the terminology of our meeting and using at
                        least a working title of groups 1, 2 and 3.</p>
                    <p>The following thematic areas have the endorsement of the group for <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> focus in response to the situation as
                        they perceive it:</p>
                    <p>—The problem involved with human rights, their advocacy, their enforcement
                        and our perceptions are universal, not bilateral. To help meet the double
                        standard question, emphasis upon the universality of application of U.S.
                        criteria would be very useful. Belgrade was cited as a possible example,
                        recognizing the possible pitfalls if the United States were seen as
                        equivocal there.</p>
                    <p>—“Human rights” per se should refer wherever possible to group one type
                        cases. Groups two and three should be focused more in the area of “problems
                        of democracy” or “problems of development” in order to keep the distinction
                        clear but still leave us room to emphasize all. Thus human rights in the
                        context of democratic traditions would be a valuable thematic area for group
                        three emphasis.</p>
                    <p>—All felt that human rights materials related to the Soviets would be
                        particularly useful. If we criticize the Soviets on human rights, it
                        undercuts the notion that human rights violations are an unfortunate but
                        necessary result of fighting communism, a position advanced universally by
                        Southern Cone governments. Such materials also would help counter the
                        feeling that the United States is singling them out.</p>
                    <p>—Governments and other audiences are quite sensitive to their image abroad
                        and its decline as a result of human rights-related confrontations, a useful
                        theme to pursue.</p>
                    <p>—Though there was general awareness that U.S. reporting on human rights
                        developments elsewhere carries dangers of being counter-productive if people
                        were to see us as taking credit for progress, all felt that such information
                        should be made available to them for discreet use in policy explication. The
                        basic logic was that it now is no secret that the United States is focusing
                        many of its foreign policy concerns around human rights but that there
                        remains a sometimes critical shortage of additional information, especially
                        facts that would lend credence to our attempts to universalize the problem
                        and our approach to it.</p>
                    <p>—There was consensus endorsement of all materials developing the concept of
                        human rights over time and geography. E.g., there are historical roots
                        within U.S. society that could be emphasized in countering the notion that
                        the human rights policy is an aberration <pb n="299" facs="0348"

                        credibility on a wide variety of other subjects ranging from science and
                        technology to culture and education. This credibility should be used to
                        associate with and enhance whatever we have to say about human rights.</p>
                    <p>—Uruguay can use tapes of testimony or speeches in order to make cassettes
                        for use on a special human rights tape deck set up in the library. Uruguay
                        also needs particular attention to radio materials since they are especially

                    <p>—Books concentrating principally upon group three items—institutional

                    <p>—Approximately four Washington-supplied speakers a year who need not bear any
                        labels of being “human rights speakers”. These would concentrate primarily
                        in the group two and three area. It was expected that official visitors
                        should concentrate on group one, with some background discussion on groups
                        two and three with the reverse being true for non-government spokesmen.
                        Argentina and Uruguay were particularly insistent upon “high quality”
                        speakers, with English speakers being acceptable if spokesmen are up to the
                        standards of, say, Judge Winslow Christian.<note n="6" xml:id="d102fn6"

                        Programers should avoid the mid-December through February period in which
                        programing of any sort is difficult. In Paraguay, that should be extended
                        back to the end of November.</p>

                        made available in full text to foreign correspondents overseas. If
                        necessary, a text could be held here for distribution at the time of
                        delivery, though this procedure would cause some delay in getting the text
                        to journalists. If no advance text is available, receipt of the text at the
                        time of delivery would also serve a similar purpose. Transcripts of
                        interviews or press conferences could also be disseminated through the
                            <gloss target="#t_WirelessFile_1">Wireless File</gloss> and quickly
                        delivered to the proper people. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> does

                        conference or interview will enable our own staff to cover the event if
                        possible, or to alert our post in the appropriate country to watch carefully

                        for the conduct of public diplomacy by the United States Government, with

                    <p>Within <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s Office of Planning and
                        Program Direction (<gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss>), we have three
                        sections handling different aspects of policy matters:</p>
                    <p>—The Policy Guidance Office receives daily from <persName corresp="#p_CWH_1"
                            >Hodding Carter</persName> the briefing papers prepared by various
                        Bureaus for his noon briefing of the press. It also is in frequent daily
                        contact with <gloss target="#t_SPRS_1">S/PRS</gloss> on specific subjects
                        not covered by briefing papers. This Office is the sole unit <pb n="303"
                            facs="0352" xml:id="pg_303"/>authorized to convey policy guidance to
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and other Agency media. All other
                        inputs must funnel through the Policy Guidance Office.</p>
                    <p>—Assistant Directors of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> area offices
                        maintain substantive relationships with their counterparts in the Department
                        of State and convey appropriate regional guidance to the Policy Guidance
                        Office for transmission to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—A newly established office of Issues and Plans is premised on substantive
                        contacts with <gloss target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss> and functional bureaus in
                        the Department (e.g. <gloss target="#t_EB_1">EB</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IO_1">IO</gloss>).
                        Essentially, Issues and Plans will work on mid-and long-term issues;
                        inevitably, these relationships will provide insights into immediate
                        concerns important to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>—and these will be
                        passed on to our Policy Guidance Office.</p>
                    <p>In our function of developing all of these guidance insights, we make the
                        following distinctions:</p>
                    <p>News: We frequently ask <gloss target="#t_SPRS_1">S/PRS</gloss> or Bureaus
                        for information on handling fast-breaking news events. But we are only
                        seeking clarification and information on whether a news story or report on
                        foreign policy is accurate. We are not requesting guidance on the “handling”
                        of the story.</p>
                    <p>Commentary: The Policy Guidance Office seeks State Department ideas and
                        guidance on how <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> should treat an issue
                        in its commentary, what the overall thrust of the commentary should be and
                        what official statements are applicable.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="italic">Is The System Working?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>News: Basically, yes. But there are four problem areas.</p>
                    <p>First, the Department is not fully cognizant of the special requirements of
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>; our requests are handled the same
                        as requests from the commercial media. <gloss target="#t_SPRS_1"
                            >S/PRS</gloss>’s work is geared basically to deadline requirements of
                        the domestic print media and evening television news. <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is on the air 24 hours a day and needs
                        reactions and answers to meet broadcast requirements in a variety of time
                        zones. We need a faster response mechanism when we are faced with commercial
                        news stories which may be misleading or inaccurate, for we want to set the
                        record straight as quickly as possible.</p>
                    <p>Second, we need advance notice of foreign policy announcements of any
                        worldwide, regional or one-country significance. This means the active
                        involvement of a significant number of Department elements. You will realize
                        that no <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officer is ever present when
                        foreign policy is evolving or decided.</p>
                    <p>Third, advance notice of foreign policy announcements and, additionally,
                        suggestions of foreign policy concerns that need clarification, can be
                        extremely useful to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> in the way it
                        deploys its correspond<pb n="304" facs="0353" xml:id="pg_304"/>ents.
                        Clearly, these suggestions must be oriented to situations and events that
                        command attention in the news; but, with that as a given, <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s correspondents can be tasked to provide
                        the on-the-spot background and framework for these events.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, we need advance texts or, at a minimum, advance knowledge of major
                        speeches by Senior State Department officials. The advance knowledge I speak
                        of implies briefings on the major points we should cover. The more we know
                        in advance, the more timely and accurate our news coverage will be.</p>
                    <p>Commentary: Here, we can do much better. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> can play a significant role in furthering foreign policy
                        objectives through <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> commentary. A
                        foreign policy analysis or commentary by <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> is specifically designed to illuminate that policy, to
                        explain and define it. I submit that the Department, excepting <gloss
                            target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss>, is generally passive as we develop
                        commentaries: We get what we seek, but seldom is the initiative with the
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>Too frequently, when we ask for suggested subjects for analytical treatment,
                        we are asked, instead, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to comment. We understand
                        this when we are in the midst of a delicate negotiation. Sometimes, however,
                        our request involves subjects debated widely around the world and <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has nothing to go with.</p>
                    <p>In general, then, we need more lead time in policy guidance from the
                        Department, not only for <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> but all of our
                        media. We need quicker responses on current, fast-breaking stories and we
                        need earlier guidance on mid- and long-term issues.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="italic">Recommendations</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Specifically, we recommend:</p>
                    <p>—more regularly scheduled briefings <hi rend="italic">by</hi> Assistant
                        Secretaries and others for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s media,
                        area and policy officers, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> commentators,
                        and others. We have no other authoritative way to learn of developing policy
                        issues and policy objectives;</p>
                    <p>—briefings <hi rend="italic">of</hi> State’s area and functional bureau
                        officers by the senior leadership of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                        >USIA</gloss>—on our role and our requirements;</p>
                    <p>—an insistence by State and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> that
                        relationships between our policy and area offices and the Department’s major
                        bureaus focus on the <hi rend="italic">substance</hi> of issues, the
                        identification of longer-range concerns and the special needs of <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>If <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> in particular, but by no means
                        exclusively, is regarded as another commercial medium, then its special
                        competence and capability will not be utilized fully.</p>
                    <p>In fine, it seems to me that policy guidance initiatives far too often stem

                    <p>Under the USIA/CU reorganization plan now on the <persName corresp="#p_HHK_1"
                            >Hill</persName> this language remains and is supplemented by statements

                    <p>“The Director shall report to the President and the Secretary of State.”</p>
                    <pb n="306" facs="0355" xml:id="pg_306"/>
                    <p>“Under the direction of the Secretary of State the Director shall have

                        functions vested in the Director.”</p>
                    <p>Although the legislative history of the reorganization tends to mitigate
                        these statements by stressing the independence of the new agency, a basic
                        responsibility clearly exists.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Present Arrangements</p>
                    <p>The process of providing policy guidance to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> functions essentially as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. First thing in the morning, the Office of Press Relations (<gloss
                            target="#t_SPRS_1">S/PRS</gloss>) tasks bureau Public Affairs Advisers
                            (<gloss target="#t_PAA_1">PAAs</gloss>) with preparation of written
                        guidance on issues which <gloss target="#t_SPRS_1">S/PRS</gloss> expects
                        will be of interest to the media.</p>
                    <p>2. Papers are delivered to <gloss target="#t_SPRS_1">S/PRS</gloss> by about
                        11 am in two copies. After conferring with the Secretary, the Spokesman
                        makes the appropriate changes in the papers and passes one copy to a
                        representative of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s Office of
                        Planning and Program Direction (<gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss>). If
                        the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> representative has additional
                        questions he can discuss the matter further with the Spokesman or directly
                        with the relevant bureau.</p>
                    <p>3. The daily noon press briefing is piped directly to <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, and they receive transcripts of those
                        sessions.</p>
                    <p>4. Immediately following this briefing, <gloss target="#t_IOP_1"
                            >USIA/IOP</gloss> representatives meet with regional and functional
                        offices of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> to disseminate the guidance received.</p>
                    <p>5. The Director of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> attends the
                        Secretary’s large Tuesday staff meeting, and as necessary seeks guidance
                        from one of the principals when immediate high-level guidance is
                        required.</p>
                    <p>Although informal, the system apparently works rather well. This is
                        particularly true of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s interactions
                        with the Spokesman. In the judgment of <gloss target="#t_SPRS_1"
                            >S/PRS</gloss> there have been no recent cases in which <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> was unaware of the Department’s policy
                        or refused to follow it. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> does
                        occasionally encounter problems when they ask for policy guidance on a new
                        issue which has not previously been staffed out. In their view there is at
                        present no focal point to which they can look when they have this kind of
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>The matter of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> control over the
                        personal and journalistic contacts of their employees is a separate and less
                        tractable problem. There have been two or three cases since January of
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> employees making what they
                        considered appropriate journalistic contacts with organizations or persons
                        proscribed from contact by the Department. However, this is an internal
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> problem of control. No amount of
                        guidance is apt to cover every single situation. This kind of guidance would
                        also <pb n="307" facs="0356" xml:id="pg_307"/>enter the gray area between
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s straight news on which the Voice
                        is independent and editorial content where they are to operate under State
                        guidance.</p>
                    <p>In past administrations, a specific Seventh Floor principal was charged with
                        providing overall policy guidance to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.
                        At the moment no one is so charged. There is further no one at the working
                        level charged with keeping himself informed on <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> programs and practices from the perspective of the
                        Secretary’s responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>After policy guidance is provided, there is no feedback as to how our policy
                        priorities are incorporated into <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        programs.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> suggests (Tab B) that the
                        President’s greatest source of support on human rights comes from people
                        rather than from their governments. Everyone I have talked to and everything
                        I have read in the past months confirms this. Each of the President’s
                        speeches and statements in this area has captured much attention and
                        generated additional support, which eventually percolates back to
                        governments. Thus I think that <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1"
                            >Reinhardt</persName>’s suggestion for a Human Rights Week speech
                        addressed to people all over the world is an excellent one.<note n="2"

                    <p>You may remember that after the last <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>
                        speech, we got many reports of reactions expressing disappointment that the
                        President had not once mentioned human rights.<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3"
                            >Reference is to the President’s October 4 address before the <gloss

                        interpreted this as a backing off from the policy (this isn’t serious—it’s a
                        press obsession that will be with us until the policy is no longer new). We
                        even got some indications of disappointment from governments who were
                        expecting some general words of praise for the positive steps that have been
                        taken in many places. Thus there is substance that can usefully be said in
                        such a speech, and I think we can be confident that the market has <hi
                            rend="italic">not</hi> been saturated with talk of human rights: I am a
                        little leery of <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>’s
                        suggestion that the speech address “the place of the individual in society”
                        which could easily get too philosophical and ethnocentric, but I believe
                        that it would be well worthwhile to take a look at his draft.</p>
                    <p>Rick informed me yesterday that a proposal for a 3–4 minute Human Rights Week
                        statement is already in the system. Obviously we would not want to do both.
                        I would suggest that it be expanded into a 10–12 minute speech.</p>

                            administration’s first year in office approaches, I have engaged in some
                            preliminary New Year’s ruminations and reflections on the experiences of
                            several months at <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. The Agency’s
                            Deputy Director, <persName corresp="#p_BCW_1">Charles Bray</persName>,
                            has just returned from a two-week visit to the Federal Republic of
                            Germany, Nigeria, Egypt, Jordan and Israel, and the impressions he
                            gathered in discussions with intellectuals, academics, media, government
                            and opposition leaders in these countries furnished more material for
                            thought. Several common themes concerning the atmospherics within which
                            we operate abroad emerged from our analysis.</p>
                        <p>—In much of the world, the intellectual discourse appears to proceed not
                            from firmly held tenets about the future of a given society, but rather
                            from questions about the direction in which societies are <pb n="310"
                                facs="0359" xml:id="pg_310"/>headed, questions about the place of
                            any society in the community of nations and about the place and role of
                            individuals within societies. Perhaps it has always been thus, but
                            questions surely outnumber answers in today’s world. In this
                            psychological climate, the President’s emphasis on human rights has
                            struck a responsive chord with peoples, if not always with governments.
                            Their interest appears to lie less in the policy implications of the
                            President’s views than in what is perceived as a powerful affirmation of
                            basic human values.</p>
                        <p>—To a remarkable extent, given the traumas of U.S. society in recent
                            years, other societies continue to look to the U.S. as a model—not a
                            perfect model, to be sure, but the most relevant model available in an
                            imperfect world. Our ideas, techniques, values and institutions are
                            perceived as workable. The substantial Nigerian investment in the
                            American educational experience (anticipated to exceed $135 million
                            annually by next year), the Egyptian reopening to the Western market
                            economy, the overwhelming German celebration of <hi rend="italic"
                                >our</hi> Bicentennial, are simply examples.</p>
                        <p>—The reverse side of the coin is the tendency on the part of many to
                            dismiss the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as an irrelevant
                            model, bankrupt of values, and essentially unworkable.</p>
                        <p>In light of the foregoing, I recommend to you and the President for
                            consideration three specific proposals:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">First.</hi> Human Rights Week (December 10–17) affords
                            the President an opportunity to address domestic and foreign
                            constituencies simultaneously, with a discussion of the place of the
                            individual in society, his relationship to government and economy, the
                            sources of our societal values, their relevance to others. I would like
                            to submit a draft speech for consideration within a short time if you
                            give preliminary endorsement to this recommendation. <gloss

                    </list>
                    <p>Public opinion research and a study of foreign media reaction, plus reports
                        from our field posts, suggest consideration of the following themes for any
                        year-end assessment of foreign policy the White House may be planning:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Continue to Seek Solutions:</hi> The Administration has
                        gained international credit from its persistent efforts to find solutions to
                        world problems. Criticism follows setbacks, of course, but reaction favors
                        the determination to seek solutions even after one or more approaches fail.
                        People want to believe that there is leadership and that it is both
                        constructive and persistent. By and large the U.S. is seen in this light.
                        The message should enhance this foreign perception. Express confidence and
                        willingness to stay the course.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Stress Human Rights:</hi> Although public opinion polls
                        abroad indicate some skepticism about U.S. motives, widespread support
                        continues for the Administration’s human rights goals. Opinion research
                        shows that individuals abroad and in the United States seek reassurance that
                        human rights remains a major American policy objective. Borrow a line from
                        the Notre Dame speech: “In the life of the human spirit, words [and, hence,
                        ideas] are action.”<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">See <ref target="#d57fn2"
                                >footnote 2, Document 57</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Highlight American Experiences:</hi> Not only in the
                        field of human rights but in economic and social problem areas, foreigners
                        are increasingly coming to regard American solutions as relevant to their
                        own actions. As examples, U.S. experiences in race relations and the work of
                        American consumer organizations.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Note the De-emphasis on Ideologies:</hi> Ineffective
                        state-planning of the communist variety finds fewer adherents. Rigidly
                        ideological solutions hold less attraction as models for developing
                        countries. To repeat, the more pragmatic, productive and creative American
                        model appears <pb n="313" facs="0362" xml:id="pg_313"/>increasingly
                        relevant. Borrow a line from the Charleston, South Carolina, speech: “And we
                        can [now] see that, on balance, the trend in the last third of a century has
                        been positive.”<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">See <ref target="#d82">Document
                                82</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Emphasize What is Fair:</hi> The concept of fairness is
                        strongly American. It animates—or should animate—our foreign, as well as our
                        domestic, affairs. The Panama Canal Treaty, the North-South dialogue, <gloss
                            target="#t_GSP_1">GSP</gloss>. Just as we seek the fair solution, so we
                        will require others to reciprocate: <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>,
                        the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> negotiations.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Evoke Cooperation:</hi> Americans now know that, despite
                        our affluence, we can no longer overwhelm our problems—that we, too, must
                        live by our wits, but have no monopoly of wisdom—that the central problems
                        leap national boundaries. Evoke from Americans and foreign peoples a
                        disposition to come together to seek solutions to common concerns.</p>

                        your informal memorandum on the “<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Slot
                        in <gloss target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss>.”</p>
                    <p>It is at considerable variance from <hi rend="italic">our</hi> institutional
                        need, which I will now present.</p>
                    <pb n="314" facs="0363" xml:id="pg_314"/>
                    <p>Our recent internal reorganization provided us with an Office of Planning and
                        Program Direction. One of the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> important
                        functions of this office is to relate to the central elements of the U.S.
                        foreign affairs agencies—<gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss>, Treasury, etc. The relations would allow
                        us to identify the mid-and long-term policy issues that can and should be
                        addressed by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s programs of public
                        diplomacy. We have gone to particular lengths to staff this office with some
                        of our best people.</p>
                    <p>Each of them will have the responsibility of working with—not in—appropriate
                        elements of the Department and other agencies so that major foreign policy
                        issues can be “converted” into communications policy governing the programs
                        we produce in Washington for the field, as well as those produced by our
                        posts themselves.</p>
                    <p>Because this is a substantive function, none of these officers would be
                        involved in the preparation of memos, speeches or press guidances for the
                        Department’s units to which they relate (the thrust of your proposal). They
                        will spend most of their time within <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.
                        They can—illustratively—assure that we initiate the kinds of research and
                        media reaction projects that are relevant to your and our concerns. They can
                        determine within <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> what public
                        diplomacy programs ought to be considered to support foreign policies, as
                        those policies are shaped.</p>
                    <p>In the case of <gloss target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss>, we proposed to assign
                        whichever of our officers you feel most comfortable with to <gloss
                            target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss> for a period of two to four weeks in order
                        to establish the most basic knowledge of your office. Thereafter, that
                        officer would call upon <gloss target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss> as necessary and
                        would participate in appropriate planning meetings and discussions with
                        members of your staff. However, he would spend the vast majority of his time
                        within <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, as I indicated above.</p>
                    <p>I hope we can move to implement this as soon as possible. The functioning of
                        the Office of Planning and Program Direction is vital to our mutual
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>If you need additional help on speeches, press guidance, memos, etc., we may
                        be able to help with one or more officers on detail, but let’s consider that
                        separate issue separately.</p>

                        <p>This position would provide <gloss target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss> with the
                            perspective of “public diplomacy” considerations, to be factored into
                            the policy planning process. At the same time, it would give <gloss

                        <p>Incumbent would be considered, and would be expected to act, as a
                            full-time member of <gloss target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss>, working under
                            the supervision of the Director of the Staff on whatever projects seem
                            appropriate to his particular abilities. This could include
                            participation in the preparation of memos to the Secretary or other
                            Department principals, speeches or press guidance papers, or any of the
                            various other analytical studies in which <gloss target="#t_SP_1"
                                >S/P</gloss> is involved.</p>
                        <p>He would also be expected to maintain close contact with the appropriate
                            offices at <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, providing them with
                            feedback on policy trends and directions as required.</p>
                        <p>His main contribution to <gloss target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss> papers would
                            presumably be in the field of public affairs aspects of policy issues,
                            how policies might be formulated to take better account of potential
                            problems—or opportunities—in foreign countries. Toward this end, he
                            would be expected to summon up whatever field reports or analysis is
                            available to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> that would relate to
                            specific studies underway at <gloss target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Depending on subject matter and Staff needs, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> incumbent would be expected to serve
                            as co-drafter or principal drafter of papers, as well as participate in
                            planning meetings and discussions with other members of the Staff.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>The undersigned, your Ambassadors to France, the Federal Republic of Germany,
                        Italy, the United Kingdom, <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the
                        European Communities met recently to discuss the present state of United
                        States–European relations. While we discussed a number of issues, the
                        purpose of this joint cable is to present a recommendation which has special
                        urgency.</p>
                    <p>It is our understanding that you will be meeting on December 6 with the
                        Acting Director of <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> to consider the
                            <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1979 budget level for the new
                        International Communication Agency.<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d107fn8">footnote 8, Document 107</ref>.</note> It is our
                        unanimous view, for the reasons suggested below, that the proposed budget
                        for the new agency is much too low to permit the kind of information and
                        cultural programs which are needed to support the U.S. national interest in
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>If we are to be successful in gaining support for your policies in Europe and
                        other parts of the world, it is not enough merely to persuade the
                        governments to which we are accredited that the courses of action we propose
                        are wise and just. We must also engage the sympathies of young Europeans,
                        particularly younger politicians, officials, teachers, writers and
                        journalists who are moving into positions of influence and leadership. They
                        have no firsthand knowledge of WWII. Moreover, many of them came of age
                        during the Vietnam and Watergate eras and are burdened by a view of our
                        country which bears little resemblance to the real America, and certainly
                        not to the kind of society your administration is striving to build. Our
                        European Embassies are making every effort to provide these young men and
                        women the information and the cultural experiences which will enable them to
                        form a more <pb n="317" facs="0366" xml:id="pg_317"/>accurate appreciation
                        of our country, but the means at our disposal are inadequate.</p>
                    <p>It is ironic that for over two decades our European information and cultural
                        efforts have been cut back while our political, military and economic
                        interests should have dictated that they be strengthened. When one considers
                        that during this same period the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern
                        Europe have greatly expanded their own Western European programs, the wisdom
                        of these reductions becomes even more questionable, and the need to reverse
                        the trend more urgent. An increase in the European programs would be
                        consistent with the United States’ commitment to the defense of Western
                        Europe and the administration’s view that that commitment is at the center
                        of our foreign and security policies.</p>
                    <p>We thus conclude and strongly urge that our information and cultural
                        programs, particularly those in Italy, France and the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, be sharply increased. While we cannot
                        speak for your Ambassadors in other European countries, we believe they
                        would also support this plea.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the creation of the International Communication Agency
                        provides the administration an opportunity to appeal to the Congress for the
                        increase in funding that is required to do the job as it should be done.</p>
                    <p>The Agency’s present budget in constant dollars is only slightly larger today
                        than when <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> was founded in 1954, and
                        substantially less than it was ten years ago. To do an effective,
                        imaginative job of explaining American society and the administration’s
                        policies will require considerably more. For Europe alone it would take
                        something on the order of $20 million to bring the Agency up to the funding
                        levels that are required to give us the programs we need today. The bulk of
                        the additional money would be spent on programs, not on bureaucratic
                        overhead. Some increase in the badly depleted <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> staffs would have to occur—hopefully through a shift of
                        Washington-based officer personnel to the field. Most of the money, however,
                        would go to fund greatly enhanced information efforts in the press and other
                        media areas, as well as a more ambitious exchange of persons program and
                        more intensive academic and student programs, including English teaching in
                        areas where appropriate.</p>

                        adequate and could be reduced. He nevertheless shares our view that it is
                        crucial that we improve our ability to communicate with the young men and

                        Exchanges</p>
                    <p>The Department of State’s <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>–1979 budget
                        request recommends program funds in the amount of $22.3 million for
                        educational exchanges and $9.0 million for the program which brings
                        carefully selected younger foreign leaders to the U.S. for 30–45 day
                        familiarization visits.</p>
                    <p>Both programs have been strong successes. For example, Sadat, <persName
                            corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName>, <persName

                            corresp="#p_KE_1">Katzir</persName> were picked by our embassies to

                        their political emergence.</p>
                    <p>We propose to raise the funding for educational exchanges by 25% (to a new
                        total of $27.9 million, vice $22.3 million) and to provide funds for an
                        additional 750 participants in the leader program (to a new total <pb
                            n="319" facs="0368" xml:id="pg_319"/>of $13.5 million, vice $9 million).
                        Such funding levels would also require increased program support costs of
                        approximately $3 million.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the <hi rend="italic">total dollar increase over the State Department

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Rationale</p>
                    <p>1. Funds are needed; present levels provide for a total two-way flow of only
                        5,200 individuals, 1,000 less than when the Republicans took office.</p>
                    <p>2. It is a visible, concrete fulfillment of the commitment in the Helsinki
                        Declaration “. . . to increase substantially cultural exchanges.”</p>
                    <p>3. This has been the most successful means ensuring that emerging foreign
                        leaders are in contact with the U.S. and U.S. leadership at an early stage
                        of their careers.</p>
                    <p>4. It is a relatively inexpensive way for the President to launch the new
                        organization in a manner which will be well received, particularly in the
                        academic community, and to demonstrate tangibly his commitment to the value
                        of these programs.</p>

                    <p>“Photography-<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>,” an exhibit of technical
                        and artistic achievements in American photography, concluded its six-city
                        tour of the Soviet Union in Moscow, where it was viewed by 262,425
                            people.<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">The exhibit traveled to Kiev, Alma
                            Ata, Tbilisi, Ufa, Novosibirsk, and Moscow.</note> The exhibit included
                        over four hundred photographs and equipment for <pb n="320" facs="0369"
                            xml:id="pg_320"/>amateur and professional photographers. Twenty one
                        Russian-speaking American guides demonstrated equipment and answered
                        visitors’ questions. This report is based on systematic debriefings of the
                        guides by a research officer who was attached to the exhibit staff, as well
                        as on his own observations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Response to the Exhibit</p>
                    <p>Public reaction to “Photography-<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” in
                        Moscow was positive and enthusiastic, as it had been in the five previous
                        cities. The exhibit areas which received the most attention were those
                        involving demonstrations of the Polaroid process—the portrait studio, the
                            <gloss target="#t_SX70_1">SX–70</gloss> stand, and the Polaroid close-up
                        camera demonstration.<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">The <gloss
                                target="#t_SX70_1">SX–70</gloss>, an instant camera first produced
                            by the Polaroid Corporation in 1972, automatically ejected photographs
                            and developed the image.</note> The most popular of photographs, judging
                        from remarks written by visitors in the exhibit comment book, were those of
                        children and those taken in space—particularly during the Apollo moon
                        missions. Individual photographers most often singled out for praise were
                        Hiro, Jay Maisel, and Milton Green. As in previous cities, the main
                        criticism of the exhibit was that the pictures did not depict life in
                        America. (The “Reflections” photo exhibit, with pictures of the type many
                        visitors expected to see at “Photography-<gloss target="#t_USA_1"
                            >USA</gloss>,” had been in Moscow six months earlier as part of the
                            “<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>–200” exhibit.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d113fn4">The “<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>–200” exhibit
                            commemorated the American Revolution Bicentennial.</note>)</p>
                    <p>Some visitors commented that many of the photographs on display had been
                        published previously in <hi rend="italic">America Illustrated</hi>. A number
                        of visitors felt the exhibit contained, in the words of one man, “too much
                        technology and too little art and humanity.” Much, of course, depended on
                        visitors’ expectations. Some thought “Photography-<gloss target="#t_USA_1"
                            >USA</gloss>” would be an exhibit of American artistic photography,
                        while others expected to see life in the United States depicted in pictures.
                        Almost everyone, however, clearly enjoyed the exhibit. The comments
                        regarding the selection of photographs concerned only one aspect of
                            “Photography-<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>,” and that not the
                        most important one for most people.</p>
                    <p>The main attraction of the exhibit, as always, was the guides. They were able
                        to answer visitors’ questions on a wide range of topics—from the equipment
                        they were demonstrating to, more importantly, life in America and American
                        attitudes toward a wide variety of subjects. Guides were not criticized in
                        Moscow for not being specialists in photography, as had often been the case
                        in other Soviet cities. Muscovites did not appear to expect technical
                        expertise from the guides, perhaps because they have had the opportunity to
                        visit more U.S. exhibits than residents of other cities of the Soviet Union.
                        Most visitors were much <pb n="321" facs="0370" xml:id="pg_321"/>more
                        interested in talking about America than about photographic technology. The
                        exhibit’s three professional photographers, meanwhile, were kept very busy
                        meeting with Soviet specialists.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Press Coverage</p>
                    <p>The opening of “Photography-<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” and a brief
                        description of the exhibit were reported by several Moscow newspapers and
                            <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss>. <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_Komsomol_1">Komsomol</gloss>’ skaya pravda</hi>, the
                        official organ of the Soviet youth organization, <gloss
                            target="#t_Komsomol_1">Komsomol</gloss>, carried a lengthy and very
                        flattering article on the exhibit written by Vasilii Peskov, co-author of
                            <hi rend="italic">The Country Across the Ocean</hi> (1975), a very
                        popular book about life in America as seen by two Soviet journalists who
                        travelled across the U.S. by car.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Security</p>
                    <p>In Moscow there were fewer reports than in previous cities of visitors being
                        picked up and questioned by the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> for
                        visiting the exhibit too often or for socializing with guides away from the
                        pavilion. On the other hand, monitoring of visitors and their conversations
                        with guides on the floor of the exhibit was much more obvious. The police in
                        charge of crowd control around the pavilion were supplemented by a dozen
                        members of the volunteer civilian militia, who occasionally removed their
                        red armbands and wandered through the exhibit. In addition, the plainclothes
                        security agents working within the pavilion on more than one occasion asked
                        certain visitors to leave the exhibit. The “Photography-<gloss
                            target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” staff, however, was not always unhappy to
                        see the militia and crowd-controllers doing their job. The exhibit attracted
                        its share of crackpots, including a self-proclaimed anarchist who wanted to
                        “blow a hole in the Iron Curtain” and a Ukrainian religious fanatic who
                        managed to alienate the guides by combining preaching with halitosis. Such
                        individuals were banned from the exhibit by Soviet authorities, a move
                        welcomed by all. But half a dozen militiamen were required to physically
                        remove Karl, an aging and increasingly desperate Soviet of German origin,
                        who reportedly has been trying for thirty-five years to leave the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Visitor Questions</p>
                    <p>Questions posed by exhibit visitors in Moscow did not differ from those asked
                        in other cities. They were primarily concerned with such U.S. domestic
                        issues as education, unemployment, crime, pensions, and the cost of living.
                        As a result, only about a quarter of the guides’ time was devoted to
                        answering questions concerning photography. (This figure varied from stand
                        to stand, with those demonstrating color printing and the Polaroid <gloss
                            target="#t_SX70_1">SX–70</gloss> speaking almost exclusively about the
                        subject at hand.) In the area of international affairs, relations between
                        the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> were of most
                        interest to visitors in Moscow. <pb n="322" facs="0371" xml:id="pg_322"
                        />President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s attitude toward
                        the Soviet Union was frequently cited, and usually criticized, by
                        Muscovites.</p>
                    <p>Education was one of the American domestic issues discussed most intensely
                        throughout the exhibit’s stay in Moscow. Visitors—almost forty per cent of
                        whom were between fifteen and twenty-five years of age—were mainly concerned
                        with the cost of and access to higher education in the U.S. They asked about
                        college tuition and the availability of scholarships and other types of
                        financial aid. Most visitors were unaware that a greater percentage of
                        American high school graduates goes on to colleges and universities than is
                        the case in the Soviet Union. Some asked about the cost of attending primary
                        and secondary schools, and many were unaware that public schools are free in
                        the United States. Others were interested in high school curricula,
                        especially mandatory subjects and courses concerning the Soviet Union or
                        Russian language and literature. Teachers asked about teachers’ salaries and
                        work loads. Visitors frequently asked what American children are taught
                        about the role of the Soviet Union in World War II, a subject dear to the
                        hearts of Soviet citizens and one which they feel is neglected in American
                        education. Racial issues in education were not a major topic of discussion
                        at the exhibit in Moscow, although visitors often asked whether blacks and
                        whites study together in American schools. Progress in the racial
                        integration of American schools did not especially impress exhibit visitors,
                        who as a general rule viewed unfavorably any contact with blacks.</p>
                    <p>Employment and unemployment were also major subjects of discussion in Moscow,
                        as they have been in every city visited by this and previous American
                        exhibits in the Soviet Union. Because, according to Marxist theory,
                        unemployment is one of the inevitable contradictions of a capitalist
                        society, it is the American “economic ill” most heavily stressed by the
                        Soviet media. The spectre of millions of jobless American workers haunts
                        people who live in a country where college graduates are assigned jobs and
                        where there is a constant labor shortage. Lectures on unemployment
                        compensation did little to dispel this very negative image visitors had of
                        the labor situation in the United States. Guides had the impression that
                        most exhibit visitors would opt for job security, even though it would
                        entail little or no choice in where they worked, <hi rend="italic">over</hi>
                        the American system—which, while offering the freedom of choice, also places
                        on the worker the burden of finding employment in a market which Soviet
                        citizens perceive to be already glutted with millions of jobless people. In
                        this, as in other areas, visitors generally preferred security to freedom of
                        choice with its responsibilities and risks. Exhibit visitors pictured
                        labor-management relations as much more hostile than they are in reality,
                        seeing employers as holding all the cards and workers virtually
                        powerless.</p>
                    <pb n="323" facs="0372" xml:id="pg_323"/>
                    <p>Crime was the second most negative aspect of life in America in the minds of
                            “Photography-<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” visitors in Moscow.
                        Visitors generally asked guides to confirm the reports by Soviet media about
                        the high incidence of violent crime in American cities and then asked them
                        to explain the causes. The most commonly posed question on this subject—and
                        the usual conversation opener—was: “Is it true that people are afraid to go
                        outside at night in American cities?” The problems of crime and unemployment
                        were not generally raised by visitors to embarrass guides or to gloat over
                        the relative absence of these particular ills in their own country, but
                        rather out of genuine curiosity and a desire to check the validity of their
                        own sources of information. Specific incidents, such as the “Son of Sam”
                        murders, although covered by Soviet newspapers, were hardly ever mentioned
                        by exhibit visitors.<note n="5" xml:id="d113fn5">These murders and attempted
                            murders took place in various New York City boroughs during 1976 and

                    <p>Conspicuous by their near absence were questions concerning current affairs,
                        with the exception of those relating to the U.S. or U.S.-Soviet relations.
                        Muscovites, like their compatriots in other cities, did not display the same
                        interest in world events that most westerners do. One reason is that they
                        cannot follow world events on a day-to-day basis in the Soviet media, which
                        do not, for all practical purposes, report what is going on in the world.
                        Newspapers and television provide only the scantiest coverage of
                        international affairs, and that is so slanted and barren of detail as to
                        make it of little interest to the average citizen. Visitors tended to ask
                        about those things which they felt had a direct bearing on their own lives.
                        This included, above all, questions on America and on U.S.-Soviet relations.
                        Asian, African, South American, and Middle Eastern affairs were rarely
                        brought up aside from an occasional “Why do you support the Israeli
                        aggressors?” or “Why do you support the racist regime of South Africa?”
                        Discussion of Soviet domestic issues, particularly Soviet leadership, was
                        taboo at the exhibit. The new Soviet draft Constitution was felt to be
                        either uninteresting or irrelevant. In private, however, Brezhnev jokes and
                        talk of a new “personality cult” were common.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet-American Relations</p>
                    <p>Most guide-visitor discussions of Soviet-American relations revolved around
                        the person and politics of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName>. Visitors made it very clear that they strongly
                        desired friendlier relations with the United States. They saw in the
                        policies of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> an
                        obstacle to such relations and held him personally responsible for increased
                        tension between the two countries. Some viewed as hypocritical the
                        President’s criticism of the Soviet Union for human rights viola<pb n="324"
                            facs="0373" xml:id="pg_324"/>tions while the United States continued
                        giving aid to South Korea and Chile. He was criticized for not fulfilling
                        his campaign promise to strive for arms limitations. His prestige with
                        Soviets suffered another blow when it was announced that the United States
                        was planning to develop a neutron bomb.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> was not, however,
                        completely without strong supporters among exhibit visitors in Moscow. They
                        included dissidents, Baptists, Old Believers, would-be emigrants, and others
                        who had run afoul of the Soviet security organs. Many of these people left
                        at the exhibit letters and appeals addressed to President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> or the U.S. Congress.</p>
                    <p>Some visitors complained that the United States seemed more eager to improve
                        its relations with China than with the Soviet Union. This is a delicate
                        issue with the Soviet people who appear to dislike and distrust their
                        Chinese neighbors and who feel that Russians and Americans are natural
                        allies. In spite of <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard Nixon</persName>’s
                        initiatives to re-establish contacts with the People’s Republic of China, he
                        is by far the most respected of recent American Presidents because of his
                        policy of detente with the Soviet Union. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, on the other hand, is seen as
                        having undone much of the good work of <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> in the area of Soviet-American relations.</p>

                    <p>The subject of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> was raised in Moscow more
                        frequently than in other cities where “Photography-<gloss target="#t_USA_1"
                            >USA</gloss>” was shown. Visitors often referred to news items they had
                        heard on <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>-Russian broadcasts in
                        conversations with exhibit guides. This was often in connection with matters
                        not covered by the Soviet mass media, such as criticism at the World
                        Psychiatric Congress of Soviet use of psychiatry for punishing political
                        dissidents. Only on a very few occasions did exhibit visitors accuse <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> of distortion or an anti-Soviet bias. Most
                        often people simply asked guides if what <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> broadcasts is true. Many were impressed with the Voice’s
                        coverage of Soviet internal affairs, clearly of very great interest to
                        listeners. Visitors often asked how <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        obtains information about events in the Soviet Union and is able to air them
                        so quickly.</p>
                    <p>People occasionally asked about individual <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> personalities, particularly those broadcasting in Russian.
                        Several Muscovites brought gifts to be delivered to Voice of America
                        announcers. Some expected to find <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        represented among the exhibit guides, as has been the case in several
                        previous exhibits.</p>
                    <p>Exhibit visitors had numerous and often predictable suggestions for improving
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts. Dissidents, for
                        example, wanted more coverage of the dissident movement in the Soviet Union
                        and a harder <pb n="325" facs="0374" xml:id="pg_325"/>line in the news.
                        Several people suggested that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> make more
                        direct comparisons between life in the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Everyone,
                        regardless of their political views, expressed interest in programs which
                        present American views on the Soviet Union and its achievements. Also of
                        interest to many listeners were <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> reports
                        on Soviet emigrants living in the United States—how they adjust to life
                        here, how they are treated, and, especially, how they have fared in finding
                        jobs. Several exhibit visitors in Moscow suggested that <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> should offer to provide American pen-pals
                        for its listeners. A young scientist said he very much regretted that <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> stopped giving English lessons in its
                        Russian-language broadcast.</p>
                    <p>When young people mentioned <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> on the floor
                        of the exhibit, it was most often in connection with music programs. Several
                        recurring music-related themes were voiced by such visitors throughout
                            “Photography-<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>’s” stay in Moscow:</p>
                    <p>1) American country music is gaining popularity in the Soviet Union. Several
                        country and western songs have been translated into Russian and are
                        performed by Moscow groups.</p>
                    <p>2) Considerable interest exists in the fate of Soviet musicians who have
                        migrated to the U.S. For example, a number of visitors inquired about the
                        San Francisco group “Sasha and Yura.” One visitor suggested that an entire
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> program be devoted to this group,
                        with interviews and details about their life and work in the U.S. People
                        involved in the Soviet jazz world, such as jazz historian Alexei Batashev
                        and lecturer Georgi Bakhchiev, expressed strong interest in the activities
                        of such prominent ex-Soviet jazz musicians as Valeri Ponomarev, Vladimir
                        Chizhik, and Vladimir Sermakashev, all of whom are now living in New
                        York.</p>
                    <p>3) Visitors constantly stressed that they want to hear only the very newest
                        and best of rock music with as little time as possible devoted to playing
                        listeners’ requests.</p>
                    <p>4) Music fans and performers alike frequently suggested that the lyrics to
                        popular songs be read by announcers, as foreign radio—especially <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>—is a primary source of new material for
                        Soviet musical groups.</p>
                    <p>The most popular of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s Russian-language
                        music shows, judging from comments of exhibit visitors in Moscow, are Pop
                        Concert I &amp; II and the Saturday Dance Show. Several people said that
                        they and their friends dance to the music of the Dance Show and would prefer
                        that particular program to have more music and less talk. One young listener
                        suggested that songs be introduced and dedications made over the music, as
                        Radio Luxembourg does on its music programs. Judging from
                            “Photography-<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” visitors’ remarks,
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s main competition in the area of
                        popular music is Deutsche Welle.</p>
                    <pb n="326" facs="0375" xml:id="pg_326"/>
                    <p>Young Soviets are extremely serious about popular music. Moscow listeners
                        were very eager to obtain more biographical information on their favorite
                        performers, details of their private lives, their musical backgrounds, and
                        their earnings. This is especially true of jazz and jazz/rock enthusiasts,
                        who approach their music in an almost academic manner, attending lectures
                        and circulating <hi rend="italic">samizdat</hi> translations of articles
                        from “Downbeat” and other western publications.</p>
                    <p>There was much more reaction to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        English-language broadcasts in Moscow than in any other city visited by the
                            “Photography-<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” exhibit. Most often
                        mentioned was <persName corresp="#p_CWCJ_1">Willis Conover</persName>’s Jazz
                        Hour, unquestionably the most popular program of its type on the air in any
                        language. One young man said he had learned English by listening to
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWCJ_1">Conover</persName> over the past ten
                        years. To say that <persName corresp="#p_CWCJ_1">Conover</persName> is
                        practically a household word in the Soviet Union is no exaggeration. A
                        number of exhibit visitors in Moscow also mentioned <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss>’s “Now Music-<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” and
                        “Breakfast Show.” One man said he had been a fan of Phil Erwin<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d113fn6">Reference is to Phil Irwin, who co-hosted the Breakfast
                            Show, a prerecorded program, with <persName corresp="#p_GRM_1">Pat
                                Gates</persName>.</note> for about thirteen years. Another listener
                        suggested that the lyrics to selected popular songs be read on “Now
                            Music-<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>.” They need not be read at
                        dictation speed, he said, since those interested record the programs and
                        would not have any trouble understanding the words or, at least, having them
                        translated. Another visitor said he had recorded all of the “Words and Their
                        Stories” series. He noted with regret that some of the programs of the
                        series are now being repeated after two years.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment Book</p>
                    <p>Between seventy-five and a hundred persons daily took advantage of the
                        opportunity to write in the “Photography-<gloss target="#t_USA_1"
                            >USA</gloss>” comment book, located at the exit from the pavilion. The
                        book was constantly surrounded by a crowd of visitors—most of whom spent
                        more time reading the remarks of those who had preceded them than writing
                        their own comments. The comments as a whole reflected the same positive
                        attitude toward the exhibit and America that guides detected in their
                        conversations with Soviet visitors on the floor. Moreover, visitors’
                        comments in Moscow did not differ significantly from those registered in
                        previous cities. The great bulk—approximately ninety per cent—were brief
                        expressions of appreciation and approval of the “Photography-<gloss
                            target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” exhibit and wishes for closer ties
                        between the United States and the Soviet Union. Comment book writers were
                        not, however, totally uncritical.</p>

                    <p>Regarding the exhibit itself, there were a number of complaints including
                        among others, complaints that the pavilion was too small; the hours were not
                        convenient for working people; not everyone was able to be photographed by
                        the Polaroid <gloss target="#t_SX70_1">SX–70</gloss>; brochures on the
                        equipment were not given to specialists; exhibit pictures were positioned
                        too low for easy viewing in a crowded pavilion; many of the pictures had
                        already appeared in <hi rend="italic">America Illustrated;</hi> and there
                        was too much technology and too little art. The most frequent criticism
                        concerned the photography on display, on the grounds that they did not
                        depict everyday life in America. Several felt the exhibit was too small. One
                        wrote: “The <hi rend="italic">kasha</hi> is good, but the portion is
                        small.”</p>
                    <p>The comments of several visitors were directed against the neutron bomb and
                        President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>. “No! to the
                        neutron bomb!” could be found on pages of the exhibit comment book. One
                        comment was addressed to the President: “I hope that this exhibit is meant
                        as a peaceful gesture toward the people of the Soviet Union.” Visitors
                        occasionally engaged in arguments or dialogues in the comment book,
                        responding to each other’s written remarks or writing over those with which
                        they strongly disagreed. For example: “Too bad there were no biographies of
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> handed out today.” “When
                        the neutron bomb goes off,” wrote another visitor, “the biography of
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> won’t help!”</p>
                    <p>Several visitors complained in the comment book that there were no signs in
                        Luzhniki Park directing visitors to the pavilion, as is usually the case
                        with special events. Others said there was no advertising or promotion of

                    <p>On November 23, 1977, the Deputy Director asked the Associate Director for
                        Planning and Program Direction for an analysis, by December 15, “of our
                        known audiences—area by area—for magazines, films, broadcasting, speakers,
                            etc.”<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">See <ref target="#d106">Document
                                106</ref>.</note> More specifically, he asked: “What is known of
                        their capacity to handle ideas? Interest in ideas? Comments—pro and con—on
                        the quality of our products by audience members or recipients?” And he
                        invited the judgment of the research staff—clearly labeled and distinct from
                        the analysis—“as to whether we are overestimating or underestimating the
                        intellectual capacities <hi rend="italic">and</hi> interests of our
                        principal interlocutors.”</p>
                    <p>This response to his request is in two parts. The first sums up what can be
                        said by drawing together the results of studies irrespective of area or
                        media lines, and concludes with judgments of the research staff <pb n="330"
                            facs="0379" xml:id="pg_330"/>concerning ways in which the Agency may not
                        be properly estimating the capacities and interests of its audiences. The
                        second consists of a series of appendices giving more detailed analyses,
                        medium by medium, with special papers on certain geographic areas where
                        carrying out traditional Agency programs is not possible.</p>
                    <p>Where comparisons by geographic area are possible (they are not always), we
                        have more often included them in the detailed appendices. We omit
                        information on the caliber of Agency speakers and its lecture and seminar
                        programs for lack of systematic studies in this field.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                        <hi rend="roman">B.</hi> Overview</p>
                    <p>Over recent years audience measurements for various Agency products confirm
                        the clearly high intellectual capabilities of the Agency’s audiences and
                        their high interest in ideas in most of the thematic areas covered by the
                        Agency’s programming. Over most of the range of its media products, the
                        Agency is doing a very good job in providing materials which meet these
                        audiences at their intellectual level. Its record seems particularly good in
                        the magazine field, and there is little sign of disaffection or
                        dissatisfaction among radio listeners. The Agency-produced films of several
                        years ago had a more variable record of communicating ideas to audiences at
                        their levels. <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> centers and libraries,
                        based on a limited number of studies, seem to attract Agency audience groups
                        only selectively, but to be generally accepted by those attracted.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, within this general very good record of meeting audience levels
                        of intellect and interest, there were also indications of some areas where
                        improvement would be possible, through such measures as: establishing a
                        better balance among thematic areas in Agency products; heightening their
                        relevance to national development or other national priority needs of
                        audiences; introducing (in films, for example) a greater degree of clarity
                        of theme or purpose and a depth of treatment consistent with audience
                        expectations; and seeking to counter, in <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> programming, a certain sense of institutional stodginess
                        and introduce a greater sense of intellectual involvement with issues and
                        events throughout its services. In addition, their intellect and interests
                        suggest that a substantial proportion of the potential priority audience not
                        now being reached through <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Center
                        programs might be reached through more active programming away from Center
                        sites and in milieux to which persons of this type are more accustomed.</p>

                    <p>The Office of Research has not conducted a psychological testing program to
                        measure the degree of sophistication and the ability to handle ideas among
                        our audiences. Nevertheless we have established <pb n="331" facs="0380"
                            xml:id="pg_331"/>measurements of a sufficient number of related
                        qualities in our audiences to permit us to draw inferences about aggregate
                        levels of intellectual capability.</p>
                    <p>Some years ago on the basis of cumulative studies up till that time, the
                        Office of Research posited the existence of an “international informational
                        elite,” an element of varying but generally small proportion within each
                        country which appeared to share intellectual and educational characteristics
                        and interests transcending cultural and national boundaries. This elite,
                        with similarities of educational background and experience, was manifest not
                        only through its interest in information from abroad but also through its
                        higher level of exposure to local media and opinion within the country.</p>
                    <p>The subsequent research in <gloss target="#t_IOR_1">IOR</gloss> in more
                        recent years has tended to confirm the existence of such an elite. Although
                        we have not attempted to measure directly the existence of an intellectual
                        capacity for handling ideas, the characteristics from which we might infer
                        such a capability, such as level of education, degree of exposure to the
                        West through study or travel, or the attainment of a senior level in one’s
                        chosen occupation, all seem to bear out the proposition that <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> audiences do represent an exceptionally
                        high level of such capability.</p>
                    <p>Our best evidence of the caliber of Agency audiences is drawn from our
                        studies of Agency magazines, whose readers for the most part come from post
                        priority audiences.</p>
                    <p>On the average, 88 per cent of the readers of the magazines studied had at
                        least some college education, and 42 per cent had studied at the
                        post-graduate level. While the coverage in some geographic areas is not
                        sufficiently representative to permit valid comparisons between areas, the
                        consistency of results is significant. About one in four readers had studied
                        in the United States, and at least half had visited the U.S. at one time or
                        another. About half the readers were at the upper level of their
                        occupational fields, although this fact is not necessarily related to
                        intellectual capacity.</p>
                    <p>The serious reading interests of most Agency magazine audiences also appear
                        to reflect a generally high intellectual capability. The survey evidence
                        suggests that our audiences are interested in a serious discussion of
                        international political and economic affairs and turn to Agency publications
                        in order to keep abreast of political events outside their countries or
                        regions.</p>
                    <p>Even the Agency’s self-selected audiences, when they can be sufficiently
                        measured, particularly those for <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>, prove
                        to contain a substantial proportion who are of higher than average
                        educational level and, presumably, intellectual capacity.</p>
                    <p>More than half the listeners worldwide have at least some secondary
                        education, and, among this group, about one fifth have experienced <pb
                            n="332" facs="0381" xml:id="pg_332"/>university-level or higher
                        training. These proportions among <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s
                        audience are considerably greater than for those corresponding levels of
                        education among the populations at large in most countries studied.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, there are differences in this respect from one audience to
                        another. An audience of specialists in a given field, as our study of <hi
                            rend="italic">Economic Portfolio</hi> shows, is much better able to deal
                        with complex ideas in that field than a more general audience. Beyond this
                        to-be-expected difference, however, other factors enter to produce
                        differences, not so much from one geographic area to another as between one
                        level of development and another. Audiences in less developed countries tend
                        to find the quality of Agency publications somewhat higher and to find the
                        ideas they present somewhat more stimulating and important than their
                        counterparts in developed countries, though both give good marks.</p>
                    <p>Associated with level of national development, there is a similar contrast in
                        the character of audiences in media-rich and open societies compared with
                        those from media-poor or closed societies. The average educational level of
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> listeners in Africa, the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and the Middle East is likely to be
                        considerably higher than the national average; in Western Europe, Latin
                        America, and Japan, on the other hand, the average educational level of
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> listeners is likely to be closer to
                        the national average. We feel that these findings are related to the quality
                        of the prevailing media environment, especially in Western Europe, where
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> competes for a potential audience
                        with a large number of highly developed electronic media outlets often
                        conveying highly sophisticated content. Moreover, listeners in media-poor
                        societies (in some of which the media are also state-controlled) often
                        report tuning to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> for information not
                        available in the local media. Soviet listeners to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> are also thought to need a greater depth of background
                        information on items carried by the Voice, not because of a lower
                        intellectual capacity but for lack of access to sufficient information
                        through other channels.</p>
                    <p>Language is also a factor associated with educational level in
                        differentiating among audiences in intellectual capacities. Those who listen
                        to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> in English, although fewer in
                        number, tend to be more sophisticated than those who listen in their
                        vernacular language.</p>
                    <p>But the burden of the data we have indicates that despite these differences
                        from one category to another, on most counts the Agency audiences are on the
                        average far above the general population in those characteristics which
                        would indicate a higher intellectual capacity.</p>

                        <hi rend="roman">D.</hi> Audience interests in ideas</p>
                    <p>The fact that these audiences participate in <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> programs, the purpose of which is primarily to communicate
                        ideas, is itself an indica<pb n="333" facs="0382" xml:id="pg_333"/>tion of
                        interest in ideas. Their record of attendance or of acceptance of Agency
                        products shows an interest in the thematic areas the Agency has selected for
                        its program. Their interest varies, however, from one thematic area to
                        another within those areas the Agency has selected for programming. Among
                        magazine readers, for example, almost invariably, relatively few show much
                        interest in subjects relating to American art and culture. Here again, there
                        is a difference between less developed and developed countries. Audiences in
                        the <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDCs</gloss> tend to show greatest interest in
                        science and technology, and economics, and relatively little in U.S.
                        political and social processes. On the other hand, audiences in developed
                        countries show predominant interest in international political and security
                        affairs and U.S. politics and society, and less interest in science and
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>Audiences differ not only in thematic interests. Our study of the relevance
                        of American experience to Kenyan audiences indicated that interest in ideas
                        among Agency audiences is often geared to their perception of national
                        priorities and concerns for their country. Irrespective of their particular
                        occupational or disciplinary specializations, Kenyan elite audiences shared
                        an interest in information from other countries in those areas perceived to
                        have a bearing on internal economic and social development.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, however, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> audiences seem
                        characterized more by a common interest in world affairs and in their own
                        regional affairs. A very high proportion of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> listeners give listening to the news as their strongest
                        reason for listening to radio. More often than among the general population,
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> listeners also regularly read a
                        daily newspaper, including its editorial page, and tend to follow
                        international affairs in news magazines.</p>

                        Agency products and programs</p>
                    <p>On the whole, Agency products seem to be pitched at the right level for the
                        sophistication of Agency audiences. This conclusion is most extensively
                        demonstrated in the studies done of Agency magazines. For only one magazine
                            (<hi rend="italic">Trends</hi>) have readers been specifically asked
                        whether they believe it should be at a higher or a lower level of
                        sophistication or is about right. For others, readers have been asked other
                        questions related to intellectual level. Most find the level about right.
                        Agency magazines also rate pretty much on a par with comparable commercial
                        magazines. As a specialized publication for a specialized audience, <hi
                            rend="italic">Economic Portfolio</hi> does especially well in satisfying
                        its audience.</p>
                    <p>Audience comments on the quality of Agency publications do vary somewhat
                        according to the locus of the reader. For example, data on <pb n="334"
                            facs="0383" xml:id="pg_334"/>some relevant opinions about the
                        intellectual level of <hi rend="italic">Horizons</hi> indicate that
                        Europeans are more likely to score the magazine lower than readers in the
                            <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDCs</gloss>. The opposite is true of <hi
                            rend="italic">Dialogue</hi>. On the other hand, the Agency regional
                        magazines, like <hi rend="italic">al-Majal</hi>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3">Published monthly in Arabic for distribution in

                            and English for distribution in sub-Saharan Africa.</note> could be
                        regarded as competitive with similar magazines available to the readers on
                        such criteria as being <hi rend="italic">serious</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                            >“thought provoking.” Economic Impact</hi> was rated highly even in West
                        Germany and Japan for providing “sophisticated discussion of economic
                        subjects,” although the rating on that score was somewhat better in
                        Colombia.</p>
                    <p>There is also ample evidence that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        strikes a satisfactory level for most of its audience—though this may be a
                        case of circular demonstration, since unsatisfied listeners would tend to
                        tune out. Nevertheless, the high credibility <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> enjoys where tested, the high acceptance its programs have
                        among listeners indicates that it is matching pretty well their intellectual
                        standards. One must add, of course, that the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> audience apparently covers a fairly broad range of
                        intellectual types, from those with no schooling up to those with
                        postgraduate degrees, and the reaction of the most sophisticated elements of
                        its audience might well differ from that of the listernership in
                        general.</p>
                    <p>One factor that appears to serve as an index of the intellectual capacity of
                        the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> audience is regular listenership to
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> news and analysis. A mail survey of
                        known <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> listeners in the Middle East,
                        Africa, and Latin America showed that 50 to 60 per cent of those who
                        responded listen to the entire <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> news
                        program, which lasts about 30 minutes and includes 15–20 minutes of
                        backgrounders, opinion roundups, and commentary. Fragmentary data—from field
                        surveys—suggest that 5 to 15 per cent of the regular audience listen to
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcast <hi rend="italic"
                            >primarily</hi> to hear news analysis and commentary. These figures
                        appear to confirm that although others also listen to these programs, a
                        small segment of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> listeners is
                        particularly engaged by the ideas they present.</p>
                    <p>In the films and television domain, the evidence of acceptable sophistication
                        is less strong, at least for Agency films dating from the 1974–75 period.
                        Although audiences gave these films generally favorable ratings, some were
                        clearly much less satisfactory than others in engaging the intellectual
                        level of the audience—sometimes because they dealt with more difficult
                        social problem themes rather than the more widely appreciated, less
                        problematic, science and technology subjects.</p>

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Centers and Libraries also received
                        generally favorable ratings from the audiences they attracted (here again
                        the circularity of the appraisal of self-selecting audiences is a factor).
                        There is some indication that <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                        priority audiences, while holding a favorable image of the centers, tended
                        to feel that the local center was primarily for younger people and language
                        students. Nevertheless, the available data on the program preferences of
                        actual or potential patrons of our libraries and centers indicate
                        considerable interest in ideas. For example, lectures, panel discussions and
                        seminars held the greatest appeal for non-student visitors to libraries in
                        Beirut and Tehran; in Brazil and francophone Africa, respondents (including
                        non-patrons) also expressed great interest in lectures and seminars in their
                        fields of interest.</p>
                    <p>Fragmentary evidence suggests that within the total audience universe, those
                        who are reached by centers—a minority of the total—may not differ all that
                        strongly from those who do not attend and are not reached. Where programming
                        is principally in English, those with good English facility tend to be more
                        prominent among those attending the center. Attending audience members also
                        seem more accustomed than non-attendees to visiting foreign centers in
                        general (American or other), perhaps because of having visited or studied
                        abroad. But attendees and non-attendees alike seem to share many of the same
                        interests—including interests in attending lectures in their professional
                        fields, and sometimes in non-professional subjects as well. Those not
                        reached, in other words, would seem in many ways equally susceptible to
                        being involved in <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> programming.</p>

                        Agency products and programs</p>
                    <p>Part of our assignment is to assess whether the Agency is over- or
                        underestimating the level and interests of its audiences. The record we have
                        indicates the Agency is doing well on the whole. Within the overall
                        generally favorable picture of a good match between <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> products and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> audiences, however, we believe there are a number of areas
                        where improvements should be possible.</p>
                    <p>Frequently discussed by the Office of Research in the past has been the need
                        for a shift in the balance of coverage given different thematic areas,
                        cutting down on attention to cultural subjects and emphasizing more the
                        political and economic themes. It will be some time before our research
                        findings can reflect the results from any changes currently under way in
                        this area in Agency planning and program direction.</p>
                    <p>Equally important, at least in the less developed countries, is the need for
                        the Agency to assure the relevance of its products to the national concerns
                        and priorities of these countries, not by adopting the <pb n="336"
                            facs="0385" xml:id="pg_336"/>rhetoric of the Third World, but by
                        presenting American experience, where appropriate, in the light of its
                        significance for dealing with problems of development, and the efforts in
                        management, planning, training and education that accompany this
                        process.</p>
                    <p>The lesson of the film-testing experience indicates the need for having
                        clearly in mind and communicating to audiences a definite purpose for a film
                        production, while conveying the importance of the subject and offering an
                        adequate depth of treatment about it. Particularly useful as a device for
                        accomplishing this purpose seems to be the technique of presentation in the
                        form of problem and solution.</p>
                    <p>The danger of underestimating the intellectual level and interests of the
                        audiences, which characterized film production earlier, seems to us to
                        remain strong in the area of center programs. There, so much effort seems to
                        go into the presentation of cultural programs involving the audience only
                        passively while not stressing programming devoted to the exchange of ideas
                        on key international political and economic issues. The similarity of
                        interests between audiences who attend and do not attend center programs
                        suggests that <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts might do better
                        to program more in vernacular languages and away from centers, within the
                        academic, professional or trade association settings where the non-attending
                        elites are apparently more accustomed to look for involvement with
                        ideas.</p>
                    <p>A particular challenge to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>, we feel, is
                        the need to counter the impression (which comes up in some of our discussion
                        panels) of being stodgy or rigid in the presentations of news and news
                        analysis. Listener panelists sometimes commend other stations for an
                        evocative kind of treatment, for being particularly adept at engaging their
                        interests and seeming spontaneous.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, Agency audiences, we feel, are not looking for flashy or glossy
                        products. Films and magazines generally get good marks for technical
                        excellence, and majorities of our magazine readers are not in favor of
                        greater use of illustrations or more extreme forms of layout. Rather, we get
                        the impression that they look for importance in content. Perhaps the basic
                        question, then, is whether the Agency is doing enough in its output to
                        excite and stimulate the thinking of intellectually active people.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPM_1">Simon</persName> started the meeting by
                        saying that it was instigated by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1"
                            >Marks</persName>, who, he said, had good ideas and would work for
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> then explained his
                        interest, since 1966, in forming a Foundation(s) primarily to be funded from
                        counterpart funds for educational exchange programs. He said that in 1966,
                        when he was Director of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, the creation
                        of a Foundation failed at the last minute because of domestic Indian
                        politics. Nevertheless, he said he still believed in the idea and thought
                        that the time might be right to try again. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1"
                            >Marks</persName> thought that (1) a Foundation should function
                        similarly to Binational (<persName corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName>)
                        Commissions; (2) the U.S. Ambassador and the appropriate local Ministry
                        should name a Foundation’s governing board to be made up of U.S. citizens
                        and nationals of the host country; and (3) major funding for the programs
                        should come from counterpart funds but appropriated money would be
                        required.</p>
                    <p>Some of the problems of obtaining counterpart funds for exchanges were
                        reviewed. It was noted, for instance, that the country of origin would have
                        to agree to the expenditure of the funds and that Burma, for example, had
                        never been willing to use funds for exchanges. The difficulties of obtaining
                        U.S. Government concurrences for employing counterpart funds also were
                        mentioned but not dwelt upon.</p>
                    <p>The group agreed that steps should be taken to see if the objective might be
                        achieved. Congressman <persName corresp="#p_SPM_1">Simon</persName>
                        suggested legislation. Instead of separate legislation, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MJL_1">Janean Mann</persName> recommended that it be
                        included in the Agency’s <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1979
                        authorization bill. She thought that would be the fastest means to the end,
                        and that support would at least come from <persName corresp="#p_FDB_1"
                            >Fascell</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJH_1">Buchanan</persName>,
                        and <persName corresp="#p_MHS_1">Meyner</persName> of the authorizing
                        subcommittee.</p>
                    <pb n="338" facs="0387" xml:id="pg_338"/>
                    <p>Rather than legislating for specific countries, basic legislation was
                        recommended. However, since Egypt and India have counterpart funds, and are
                        politically significant, they would be logical choices for programs.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_SPM_1">Simon</persName> ended the meeting
                        by asking <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Janean Mann</persName> and Keith
                        Gartner to draft possible legislative language. He requested <persName
                            corresp="#p_JWM_1">William Jones</persName> to inform Congressman
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJB_1">Jack Brooks</persName> of what was being
                        done and Janean <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Mann</persName> to pass the
                        word in the International Operations Subcommittee. Future actions, he added,
                        should be coordinated with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1"
                            >Reinhardt</persName>.</p>
                    <p>No mention was made of the need or desirability to coordinate House plans
                        with the Senate.</p>
                    <p>There was passing reference to getting the necessary appropriations if the
                        programs were authorized. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName>
                        said he thought he could get funding support from <gloss target="#t_Cong_1"
                            >Cong</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">John Slack</persName>,

                    <p>NOTE: <gloss target="#t_Cong_1">Cong</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_FDB_1"
                            >Fascell</persName> approved the plan after discussing it with Mr.

                    <p>Between 1973 and 1976, the Agency conducted several studies among foreign
                        elites which touched on the image of American culture abroad. They showed
                        that European and Japanese elites see American culture in a modern,
                        technological sense as opposed to the more narrowly traditional character
                        they ascribe to their own. Though varying in emphasis from country to
                        country, Europeans generally think of film, writing, science, technology and
                        various forms of contemporary music (e.g., pop, jazz, musicals, and modern
                        composition) as expressive of American culture. Japanese elites perceive it
                        much the same way except that few think of American writing in this

                    <p>In contrast with this contemporary image evoked by American culture, elites
                        tend to view their own in light of past achievements in the arts and the
                        humanities. Europeans most often cite literature, painting, classical music,
                        theater, and historic architectural achievements as the defining
                        characteristics of their culture. Japanese speak of traditional arts (e.g.,
                            noh<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">Classical Japanese musical drama.</note>
                        and bunraku<note n="3" xml:id="d117fn3">Japanese puppet theater.</note>)
                        crafts, aspects of Japanese religion and spirit, history, and their
                        distinctive architecture.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The American Cultural Wasteland: A Myth Buried</p>
                    <p>Although elites see the essence of American culture to be very different from
                        that of their older civilizations, they are not inclined to endorse the
                        hoary stereotype of America as a cultural wasteland. Indeed, only small
                        minorities subscribe to this once widespread myth. Far more have a fairly
                        sophisticated view of the richness of contemporary American culture and
                        readily acknowledge its contributions to the world.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, in continental Europe, substantial majorities believe American
                        motion pictures, writing and poetry, and architecture contributed
                        importantly to Western culture since World War II. Moreover, they rate
                        American achievements in these fields relatively higher than their own
                        except for the Italians who express more esteem for their cinema and the
                        French who consider their <hi rend="italic">belles lettres</hi>
                        superior.</p>
                    <p>Japanese elites also rank American achievements in these spheres above their
                        own. However, while half of them grant significance to American
                        contributions to world literature, nearly as many deprecate America’s
                        literary accomplishments.</p>
                    <p>In Britain, American present-day achievements in writing and poetry,
                        architecture, painting and sculpture, and serious music also drew generally
                        positive ratings from elites who, at the same time, revealed considerable
                        ignorance or uncertainty about American standing in the arts.</p>
                    <p>For that matter elite opinion everywhere is mixed about American
                        contributions in painting and modern ballet, fields in which Americans have
                        excelled since World War II. With the exception of the British, only
                        minorities of European and Japanese elites rate American achievements in
                        painting and sculpture important—appreciably fewer than judged their own in
                        this way. This relatively low level of esteem for American painting in large
                        part may reflect not so much informed critical judgment as ignorance about
                        American movements grounded, <pb n="340" facs="0389" xml:id="pg_340"/>as
                        other research suggests, in an antipathy toward “modern art” in general.</p>
                    <p>Opinion is divided in evaluating American contributions to the modern
                        theater. French and German elites rate their own relatively higher, but the
                        Italian and Japanese accord greater importance to American achievements.</p>
                    <p>In sum, the stereotype of “uncultured America,” once thought to be pervasive,
                        clearly does not exist among the elites of the major industrial democracies.
                        In fact, they generally are aware of and credit America’s achievements in
                        the contemporary arts.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Culture in the Overall U.S. Image: A Limited Role</p>
                    <p>The essentially positive American cultural image among European and Japanese
                        elites appears to have little impact, however, on the total image the U.S.
                        projects as a society.</p>
                    <p>Europeans who believe contemporary American artists have made significant
                        contributions to Western culture are no more likely to hold an overall good
                        opinion of the U.S. than elites who discount America’s cultural
                        contributions. Similarly, perceptions of the contemporary arts in America
                        are unrelated to interest in, or admiration for, America as a country. Nor
                        are they apparently related to general perceptions of the dynamism of
                        American society.</p>
                    <p>More specifically, only about one in 10 or even fewer in each of the nations
                        studied spontaneously mentioned cultural themes as the “worst” or “best”
                        aspects of American society. Far more in Europe and Japan associated these
                        with U.S. foreign policy, political, economic and social conditions and the
                        character of the American people.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, results of Agency magazine studies, mostly in developing
                        countries, also point to the low salience of American culture with foreign
                        audiences. These show that Agency audiences in many countries prefer
                        information about the U.S. to be other than culture oriented. In fact,
                        everywhere, the audience segment looking primarily for articles on art and
                        popular culture represented only a small minority of readers.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, foreign elite views on American culture, while generally
                        favorable, do not carry with them implications enhancing America’s overall
                        standing.</p>
                    <p>The Agency’s Office of Research carried out the elite surveys in Britain,
                        Italy, West Germany, France and Japan. In the first three countries, we
                        sampled <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>-defined priority audiences,
                        including five comparable elites whose attitudes spanned the political
                        spectrum: business executives, media leaders, government and political
                        leaders, academicians and university students. In France, we sampled urban
                        residents with at least a completed baccalauréat, the stratum from which
                        French <pb n="341" facs="0390" xml:id="pg_341"/>elites are recruited. In
                        Japan, we covered the graduates of the five most prestigious universities in
                        the country, the source of much of Japan’s leadership in government and
                        politics, business and industry, and media.</p>

                        <pb n="342" facs="0391" xml:id="pg_342"/>And of course, there are many other

                        regional and functional bureaus in the Department.</p>
                    <p>It is important to note, however, that these linkages lack central
                        coordination; although, <gloss target="#t_MMO_1">M/MO</gloss> has begun to
                        move into that vacuum.</p>
                    <p>Such coordination will become more important when the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> comes into being (probably on April 1,
                        1978) because we will have lost <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> (a major
                        present point of contact with <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>) and
                        because the State-<gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> relationship will be
                        a new one based on reorganization plan language (“under the direction of
                        SecState”) and legislative history which is highly generalized and contains
                        considerable potential for misunderstanding and disagreement.</p>
                    <p>While there was general acceptance in the House and Senate of the need for
                        “policy guidance” from the Secretary to the new Agency, it was also
                        emphasized by some Members, particularly on the House side, that State
                        should not exert day-to-day control over the operations, budget, or
                        personnel system of the new independent Agency and the separate reporting
                        channel between the <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> Director and the
                        President was stressed. Clearly this leaves a large gray in between area
                        (particularly abroad where the Chief of Mission enjoys some operational
                        control over the activities of other agencies) and it is important to create
                        a sensible, cooperative relationship in practice while personalities are
                        compatible on both sides. For example, jurisdiction-minded officials in both
                        organizations, if left to their own devices, could create all sorts of
                        difficulties which could have long lasting effects.</p>
                    <p>The situation demands sensitive, coordinated management of State’s
                        relationships with USIA/ICA (particularly the early identification and
                        resolution of issues before they become major problems) at an authoritative
                        level in the Department, if State-<gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>
                        relations are to be close and useful. It offers the chance to get off to a
                        good start.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, you should assume the formal responsibility for the management
                        of State’s relationship with USIA/ICA on behalf of the Secretary. Obviously
                        only the Secretary and you have the appropriate rank to do this.</p>
                    <p>Designation of a Seventh Floor principal is not enough to provide substantive
                        backup for State’s responsibilities vis-a-vis other organizations. I suggest
                        that responsibility for backstopping you in this new role be centralized in
                            <gloss target="#t_MMO_1">M/MO</gloss>. We have the experience and
                        capabilities there to integrate and staff the various policy, resource and
                        other issues which will need to be followed on a fairly regular basis.
                        Tasking <gloss target="#t_MMO_1">M/MO</gloss> with this duty would also
                        permit me to resolve many issues without taking them to you—the pattern
                        which now exists and which has worked fairly well during the reorganization
                        process, surely a baptism of fire.</p>

                    <p>As this reorganization has been discussed over the past few months, almost a
                        year now, I think I’ve made more speeches than I’ve ever made in my life,
                        more than I ever hope to make in the rest of my life. For it seemed to me
                        that there was room for a great deal of misunderstanding, but probably more
                        accurately, there was a great deal of ignorance among the people about
                        something called <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>There’s no question that in the past, only the most sophisticated people knew
                        anything about something called <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> or
                        something called <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. Everybody, of
                        course, knew about the Department of State, and the sophisticated people
                        knew that there were certain exchange programs operated out of the
                        Department of State.</p>
                    <p>In an effort, perhaps a vain one, to overcome this problem, I set out a
                        couple of months ago on a speaking tour on the West Coast. Some of you have
                        heard me tell this story before, and I apologize for <pb n="345" facs="0394"
                            xml:id="pg_345"/>your having to listen again. But it illustrates, it
                        seems to me, some of the problems and opportunities.</p>
                    <p>Before I went to Los Angeles, I received a little brochure that the head of
                        the World Affairs Council had sent to me, announcing my coming. Actually, it
                        was a brochure designed to persuade the members of the Council to attend a
                        luncheon, at which I was to speak. It was a very, very good job—good, slick
                        paper, good printing, excellent reproduction of my photograph. It announced
                        the subject, announced the cost of your lunch—twelve dollars and a half. And
                        I was very proud of it, for them. It seemed to me that it was quite worthy
                        of the best reproduction facilities in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>And I thought that I would make a little personal hay with this, so I decided
                        to send it to my father, who’s 87 years old, lives in Tennessee. Nobody in
                        Tennessee ever pays twelve dollars and a half for lunch.</p>
                    <p>And I was sure I could make a few points. And I put it in an envelope and
                        wrote out the appropriate sentences that could be summarized by saying,
                        “look what I’m doing these days.” And I got a prompt response. He said, “I
                        don’t know a thing about this subject that you propose to speak on, Public
                        Diplomacy, Necessity or Luxury. But I do know one thing: There is nothing
                        that you could say on any subject that’s worth twelve dollars and a
                        half.”</p>
                    <p>I was properly chastened, but I still had to go on and make this speech on
                        public diplomacy, necessity or luxury. It started me to thinking about
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> activities in the past, and
                            <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> activities in the past. Neither
                        organization can be sure that we’ve been well known, that we’ve even been
                        understood. There are good historic reasons for this. Over the years,
                        Americans as a people have stayed away from these kinds of bureaucracies
                        that could be construed by someone, at least, to be a kind of ministry of
                        information.</p>
                    <p>And this has done something, I think, to both organizations, and something
                        that can be overcome to a great extent by <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss>. In the first place, it’s made us awfully defensive. We’ve
                        spent a great deal of our time as government servants simply defending our
                        turf in an effort to prove that what we were doing was worthwhile. We were
                        always convinced ourselves, but we were afraid that others in American
                        society may not be convinced.</p>
                    <p>I won’t try to illustrate this from <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s
                        point of view, where I’ve never worked, but I think I can illustrate it
                        perfectly from <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s point of view.</p>
                    <p>One of our very important functions is libraries, 180-odd over the world. And
                        we as an agency have done a great deal of work trying to justify libraries
                        to ourselves, not realizing, it seems, that a library is a <pb n="346"
                            facs="0395" xml:id="pg_346"/>library is a library wherever you find one,
                        and the peoples around the world must know what a library is.</p>
                    <p>We’ve become defensive on this subject. We have tried to suggest that
                        libraries are institutions that are designed to attract prime ministers and
                        cabinet ministers and other members of what we’d call primary audiences.
                        When they haven’t come in, we haven’t been quite sure what to do with the
                        libraries. So the debate—the internal debate—goes on, rather than our
                        accepting that this is a powerful instrument of communication, that it will
                        naturally attract certain members of the society, and it won’t attract many
                        others. We may take the contents of the library to other members of the
                        society, but that’s all.</p>
                    <p>We’ve also put a great deal of emphasis on day-to-day communication problems,
                        and indeed, this has become one of the real problems in reorganizing these
                        activities, as some people have asserted. They say that one of the
                        organizations that has been proposed as an entity in <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>, has been interested in the short-range,
                        the day-to-day. The other one has been interested in the long-range. And the
                        opponents of reorganization, at least, have said the two won’t mix.</p>
                    <p>Well, if you put it that way, probably they won’t. But it seems to me that
                        one thing that we have learned over the years in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>—you’ve always known it in <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss>—is that very little that we have done in the past 25 years
                        has solved problems overnight. To the extent that we have been successful,
                        we have been far more successful on long-range activities than we have on
                        the short-range activities. It doesn’t mean that there aren’t short-range
                        problems, or that some of the short-range problems don’t require
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>When you look at any one of the great problems in the world, in the last 25
                        years, we would be bold indeed if we suggested that, as a result of what
                        we’ve done on a short-range basis, we have turned these problems around or
                        solved them.</p>
                    <p>So long-range activities, long-range results, almost by definition grow from
                        the whole field of communication. There is a cumulative result over a period
                        of time. The reorganization, I would hope, will help us to consider, to
                        plan, to reflect on activities that we are agreed on, and to eliminate some
                        of what I have perceived, at least, to be our overdefensiveness.</p>
                    <p>What I want to talk about mainly is the organizational structure of the new
                        agency. We’ve had all kinds of input. We’ve had individual letter writers,
                        we’ve had people who call us, we have had task forces which completed their
                        work in the middle of December, as you will recall.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d120fn2">See <ref target="#d114fn5">footnote 5, Document
                                114</ref>.</note> And then it finally came to the point that we had
                        to take all of <pb n="347" facs="0396" xml:id="pg_347"/>these excellent
                        suggestions and options and recommendations and put together a structure
                        which we hope will serve the new agency well.</p>
                    <p>We do not claim that we have organized for eternity. We think that the
                        structure is completely defensible. Six months after the agency begins on
                        April 1, if we’ve made a mistake or if it simply doesn’t work as we have
                        designed it, we won’t hesitate to change it. Obviously, those who follow us
                        won’t hesitate to change it.</p>
                    <p>What we have sought is a structure in accordance with some basic principles
                        that we think should govern the new agency. In the first place, we have
                        sought a structure that is consistent with the Presidential principles
                        announced in the President’s letter, and approved by the Congress. If you go
                        back and read the covering message that the President sent to the <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHK_1">Hill</persName> with the reorganization plan, he made
                        some points.<note n="3" xml:id="d120fn3">See <ref target="#d93">Document
                                93</ref>.</note> He made very clear what it is that the new agency
                        should do, not too specifically, but there’s no question about the general
                        principles he stated.</p>
                    <p>Thus, any organizational structure must take these principles into
                        consideration. Also, in the course of talking about the new structure, the
                        new <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>, I have likened it to a
                        conglomerate, as some of you have heard me say. It is not an exact anaology
                        by a long shot, but it is an instructive one, nevertheless. A business
                        conglomerate has many entities, some of them seemingly disparate entities.
                        They make motion pictures, they explore for oil, they make clothing, they
                        engage in any number of other activities.</p>
                    <p>Some of these activities may be dominant. If you’re exploring for oil and you
                        hit oil, you’re probably going to get more money. The conglomerate is going
                        to get more money from that entity than it can possibly get from publishing
                        books.</p>
                    <p>Still, businessmen in their wisdom have seen fit to bring together these
                        seeming disparate entities in an effort, obviously, to make a profit. It is
                        possible to look at all of the entities in the new <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> and say that some of them are quite unlike others. Again,
                        those who have not been fond of the reorganization have pointed up this
                        fact. An organizing structure such as we have presented today, we hope, will
                        help overcome this seeming separateness of some of the entities.</p>
                    <p>We have been determined that there should be, perhaps as never before, a core
                        management in the new organization, not a core management to be concerned
                        with the tactical programs on a day-to-day basis. We couldn’t follow these
                        if we wanted to, because we’re too widely dispersed as an organization.</p>
                    <pb n="348" facs="0397" xml:id="pg_348"/>
                    <p>On the other hand, there should be a management that is concerned with the
                        general strategic purposes and objectives of the new organization, to set
                        them without any hesitancy, and to make certain that they are carried out in
                        some way, carried out efficiently.</p>
                    <p>This core management grows out of the reorganization plan sent to the
                        Congress. It consists of a Director, a Deputy Director and four Associate
                        Directors, who will meet frequently and who will be concerned with the
                        overall strategic planning of the organization.</p>
                    <p>I have frequently used the words centrality of purpose and it’s a phrase
                        that’s been misunderstood. I should at least tell you what I mean by it.</p>
                    <p>By centrality of purpose, I mean little more than that all our activities
                        should have a purpose and should have some simple connection with the
                        overall objectives of the <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>. I do not
                        mean by this that around the world, in 184 places, we are going to have 184
                        posts doing exactly the same thing at the same time. I do not mean by this
                        that there is a kind of lasso on entities of the organizations overseas and
                        that they must do the same thing at the same time.</p>
                    <p>I mean only that whatever they’re doing should meet certain strategic
                        standards that we will set, and that we can be knowledgeable about it.</p>
                    <p>Finally, in the course of these generalities, I’ve said that the organization
                        must have two forces in it, two dominant forces, one centrifugal and one
                        centripetal. The organization must have a clear-cut statement of purposes,
                        objectives and strategies. These will flow out from core management. But
                        there must also be flowing into core management, principally from the field,
                        ideas, plans, purposes in the light of the communications problems and
                        opportunities that exist overseas, whether it is a cultural exchange
                        program, or a motion picture, or something going from the print media.
                        Brazil is still different from Indonesia, and we can only know what the
                        problems and opportunities are in each insofar as we have flowing into the
                        organization the ideas as they are seen from the field.</p>
                    <p>Some of this will be a repetition of what I have said. But since these are
                        the principles that have guided us, I thought that we should go through
                        them, one at a time.</p>
                    <p>The new structure must provide—as I’ve just said—a core management group
                        responsible for establishing broad agency policies and securing their
                        effective execution. The agency must have a sense of strategic purpose
                        consistent with overall U.S. policy goals—almost a repetition of what the
                        President has already set for us.</p>
                    <p>The agency structure, as you will see shortly, should provide clear lines of
                        authority and accountability at every level. Overlapping <pb n="349"
                            facs="0398" xml:id="pg_349"/>responsibilities and operations should be
                        reduced to the absolute minimum. We hope that we have done this in setting
                        up the structure. We of course cannot be sure until the agency begins its
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Inflation of job titles should be reversed. There’s a long congressional
                        history of questions on this subject which has helped us make up our minds
                        on it.</p>
                    <p>The number of nonrelated staffs reporting to principal officers in core
                        management should be reduced to the minimum.</p>
                    <p>The organizational structure itself must enhance the integrity of the
                        academic exchange programs and the news operation of the Voice of America,
                        mandated by the President and the Congress. In the case of the Voice of
                        America, notice that it says the <hi rend="italic">news</hi> operation of
                        the Voice of America. A great deal of the Voice of America programming has
                        little or nothing to do with news.</p>
                    <p>There should be a central point of reference for relations with field posts.
                        By the same token, field perspectives must suffuse the entire agency, for
                        still, a great deal of the work of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>, as
                        has been the case with both <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, is overseas. We all have gotten the
                        message about the two-way dialogue, about the mutuality of activities, about
                        intercultural relations, about the bringing of American people together with
                        foreign people in various ways.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, a great part of the agency’s work will still be physically
                        overseas.</p>
                    <p>The structure of the organization should call for new patterns of thought and
                        afford opportunities for creative initiative.</p>
                    <p>These are principles that we thought about a great deal. We have recorded
                        them because they have guided us in the designing of the structure.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>’s
                        explanation of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>’s organizational
                        structure.]</p>
                    <p>QUESTION: John, how do you see the relationship of the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> Director to the Secretary of State?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>: The Secretary of
                        State, under <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>, as under <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, will be responsible for policy
                        guidance, both tactical and strategic, to the Director of <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>. This will be the principal relationship.
                        The other relationships between the two will be collegial and, depending on
                        the issue at hand at any one time, close, we hope.</p>
                    <p>The two functions of public and traditional diplomacy are different
                        functions, as agreed by all. The public diplomacy function supports, in its
                        long-range effects, the efforts of traditional diplomacy. The two functions
                        are both necessary to the national interest.</p>

                        between the United States and other nations. In international affairs, as in
                        our personal lives, the starting point for dealing effectively with others
                        is the clearest possible understanding of differing points of view. The
                        fundamental premise of the International Communication Agency is that it is
                        in our national interest to encourage the sharing of ideas and cultural
                        activities among the people of the United States and the people of other
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>It is in the general interest of the community of nations, as well as in our
                        own interest, that other nations and other peoples know where this great
                        country stands, and why. We want them to understand our values, our
                        institutions—the vitality of our culture—and how these relate to their own
                        experience. We must share our successes, and look for help in learning from
                        our failures. We must make available to people of other nations facts they
                        would not otherwise learn about ourselves and our views.</p>
                    <pb n="351" facs="0400" xml:id="pg_351"/>
                    <p>It is also in our interest—and in the interest of other nations—that
                        Americans have the opportunity to understand the histories, cultures and
                        problems of others, so that we can come to understand their hopes,
                        perceptions and aspirations. In so doing, the Agency will contribute to our
                        capacity as a people and as a government to manage our foreign affairs with
                        sensitivity, in an effective and responsible way.</p>
                    <p>You and your colleagues have five main tasks:</p>
                    <p>1. To encourage, aid and sponsor the broadest possible exchange of people and
                        ideas between our country and other nations. It will be your job to:</p>
                    <p>—Continue successful government-sponsored exchange programs that now come
                        under your Agency, and improve them wherever possible.</p>
                    <p>—Encourage private institutions in this country to develop their own forms of
                        exchange and aid those that are in the broadest national interest.</p>
                    <p>—Provide counsel and information on our international exchange program as a
                        whole, and assist in maintaining broad participation in the international
                        exchange programs conducted by government departments and agencies,
                        including those administered by the International Communication Agency.</p>
                    <p>2. To give foreign peoples the best possible understanding of our policies
                        and our intentions, and sufficient information about American society and
                        culture to comprehend why we have chosen certain policies over others. In so
                        doing, you will wish to draw upon thoughtful and representative Americans,
                        through the use of radio and television, magazines and other printed
                        materials, and through seminars, personal contacts, the presentation of
                        American art and culture, and the teaching of the English language where
                        necessary and appropriate.</p>
                    <p>3. To help insure that our government adequately understands foreign public
                        opinion and culture for policy-making purposes, and to assist individual
                        Americans and institutions in learning about other nations and their
                        cultures.</p>
                    <p>4. To assist in the development and execution of a comprehensive national
                        policy on international communications, designed to allow and encourage the
                        maximum flow of information and ideas among the peoples of the world. Such a
                        policy must take into consideration the needs and sensitivities of others,
                        as well as our own needs.</p>
                    <p>5. To prepare for and conduct negotiations on cultural exchanges with other
                        governments, aware always that the most effective sharing of culture, ideas
                        and information comes between individual people rather than through formal
                        acts of governments.</p>
                    <p>In discharging these responsibilities, you must keep these goals in mind:</p>
                    <pb n="352" facs="0401" xml:id="pg_352"/>
                    <p>Since all the Agency’s activities bear a relationship to our foreign policies
                        and interests, you will seek guidance on those policies and interests from
                        the Secretary of State.</p>
                    <p>You will be responsible for maintaining the scholarly integrity and
                        nonpolitical character of the exchange programs within your agency, and for
                        maintaining the independence of the Voice of America news broadcasts. You
                        will wish to assure that they reflect the broad interests of the United
                        States and of the people served by these programs.</p>
                    <p>I look forward to your periodic accounting of your undertakings and your
                        recommendations on the conduct of public diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the Agency will undertake no activities which are covert,
                        manipulative or propagandistic. The Agency can assume—as our founding
                        fathers did—that a great and free society is its own best witness, and can
                        put its faith in the power of ideas.</p>
                    <p>I’m sure the Congress and the American people join with me in wishing you
                        every success in these important endeavors.<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">In

                    <p>As we move toward establishment of the International Communication Agency on
                        April 1, I am deeply grateful to those of you who, over the past several
                        months, have given us the benefit of your ideas, thoughts and suggestions
                        with regard to the new Agency. I have appreciated particularly your helpful
                        comments on what the new Agency should be called abroad. Your perspectives
                        have been considered at great length and with great seriousness.</p>
                    <p>Very shortly, I shall be forwarding substantive thoughts, views and
                        guidelines which, I trust, will be of help to you as you set about your work
                        in the new Agency. In the meantime, there are certain administrative and
                        logistical matters which must be attended to immediately. I would,
                        therefore, appreciate your prompt attention to the following:</p>
                    <p>1. Effective April 1, the International Communication Agency will be known
                        abroad as “International Communication Agency, United States of America.”
                        You should not, repeat not, use the terms “United States Information
                        Service” or “<gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>” to identify any part of
                        your activities. These names will cease to exist on April 1, as <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and the Bureau of Educational and
                        Cultural Affairs will cease to exist.</p>
                    <p>2. Any element of an overseas mission now called “United States Information
                        Service” or “<gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>” should be identified as
                        “International Communication Agency, Embassy of the United States of
                        America.”</p>
                    <p>3. Elements of your post which are institutional in nature (e.g., libraries,
                            <gloss target="#t_BNC_1">BNC</gloss>’s, Centers, etc.) may continue with
                        their current names, except in those cases where institutional names contain
                        the terms “United States Information Service,” “<gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss>,” “U.S. Information Center” or any variation or
                        translation of these terms. The latter names must be changed on April 1.
                        Where name changes are required, you should select a preferred new name and
                        forward it soonest by cable through your area director for approval. Names
                        such as “American Cultural Center,” “Thomas Jefferson Library,” “<persName
                            corresp="#p_FJH_1">Benjamin Franklin</persName> Center,” “American
                        Center,” etc. are entirely acceptable.</p>
                    <p>4. Within a matter of weeks, you will be receiving information and guidance
                        by pouch on new stationery and other printed materials. In the meantime, you
                        are to make temporary, interim arrangements so that, effective April 1, your
                        post activities are identified either as “International Communication
                        Agency, Embassy of the United States of America” (non-institutional
                        presence), or, for example, “<persName corresp="#p_FJH_1">Benjamin
                            Franklin</persName> Center, International Communication Agency, United
                        States of America” (institutional presence). In all instances, you are to
                        spell out the words “International Communication Agency”; you are not to use
                        the initials “<gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>” or “<gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>” in printed form. You should use no
                        stationery or other printed materials on April 1 or thereafter which refer
                        to the “United States Information Service” or “<gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss>”. Pending <pb n="354" facs="0403" xml:id="pg_354"/>further
                        guidance, you should likewise make arrangements to remove, effective April
                        1, any signs bearing these terms and substitute interim signs identifying
                        your post with the new Agency name.</p>
                    <p>5. There is a preference for using “International Communication Agency,”
                        wherever possible, in English. However, where you feel it is essential or
                        desirable to translate the name, your recommended translation should be
                        forwarded immediately for approval through your area director. An official
                        Agency translation in each language will then be decided upon for
                        coordinated Agency-wide use.</p>
                    <p>6. All posts in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, excepting only those in
                        Yugoslavia, are specifically excluded from the above decisions. These posts
                        will be handled as a separate matter and should continue to operate for the
                        time being under the “<gloss target="#t_PC_1">P&amp;C</gloss>”
                        designation.</p>
                    <p>7. I trust you will do everything possible to insure that these and other
                        changes in the weeks ahead cause minimal disruption to your programs and
                        activities. In launching a new organization, we must all exert extra effort
                        to maintain program continuity and effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>I appreciate fully the strong feelings many of you have expressed about
                        retaining the “<gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>” name used for many
                        years overseas. I share a certain emotion that, for us and our colleagues in
                            <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, must inevitably accompany the
                        passing of two old and beloved organizations which have commanded so much of
                        our professional lives and energies, and which, I am convinced, have
                        contributed far beyond popular recognition to our interests and well-being
                        as a nation. I realize, too, that this change may cause you some short-term
                        difficulties in your work.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, the President has made it clear that the establishment of the
                        International Communication Agency is an act of creation. I subscribe fully
                        and enthusiastically to this view. As I have said repeatedly, I am firmly
                        committed to the notion that the new Agency be more than the simple sum of
                        its constituent parts, that it be a truly new Agency with new visions, new
                        structures, new relationships, new thought patterns and new objectives, all
                        pursued with renewed professional commitment.</p>
                    <p>Our name—at home and abroad—must reflect this transition, this act of
                        creation. I warmly commend the dedication and the skills you have displayed
                        in behalf of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, the American Government

                            (Ibid.)</note> I have significantly revised the North-South scholarship
                        proposal, shortening it from 4 pages to a little more than one page. I have
                        also mentioned the idea of a poor but talented undergraduate program, but
                        combined the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> recommendation with that
                        of the other agencies. As written, the recommendation is just for
                        designating graduate students who already have scholarships. I think the
                        President is likely to approve the idea for three simple reasons: all of the
                        agencies are pretty much in agreement; it is a compelling symbol of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interest in the developing world,

                        <p>Several years ago, President <persName corresp="#p_PCA_1"
                                >Perez</persName> initiated a large-scale scholarship program,
                            called the Ayacucho Program,<note n="6" xml:id="d123fn6">Known as the
                                Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho scholarship program.</note> with the
                            purpose of trying to educate an entire new generation of Venezuelans. My
                            staff has been working with people from other agencies on a proposal
                            which is very similar to <persName corresp="#p_PCA_1">Perez</persName>’
                            program, only it would finance the scholarships of students from all the
                            developing countries to study in the U.S. <hi rend="italic">Your stop in
                                Caracas would provide a perfect opportunity to announce the program,

                        </p>
                        <p>The program is quite simple. Its purpose would be to focus the attention
                            of the American people on the importance of the developing world—a
                            principal theme of your Caracas speech.<note n="7" xml:id="d123fn7"

                                Casona in Caracas, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                                referenced the benefits of cultural exchange programs in
                                establishing “bonds of understanding.” He continued, “Because of
                                this visit and others on my journey, and in memory of your friend,
                                our great American statesman, <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Hubert
                                    Humphrey</persName>, I would like to announce tonight my
                                intention to establish a program of Humphrey scholarships which will
                                bring poor but outstanding students from Latin America and
                                throughout the world to study in the colleges of the United States.”
                                (Ibid., p. 618) The full text of <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName>’s remarks is ibid., pp. 617–619.</note> The
                            scholarship program could be named for Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName>, who was so identified with
                            and so sympathetic to the North-South dialogue. Like the Rhodes
                            scholarships, the Humphrey scholarship could provide education and a
                            common experience for a new generation of leaders.</p>
                        <p>The program could be focused in one of two directions. We could select
                            five poor but extremely talented undergraduates from all the developing
                            countries (approximately 600 per year) and finance their undergraduate
                            education. This program would cost about $30 million and for that reason
                            many of the agencies believe that the direction of the program should be
                            towards graduate students.</p>
                        <pb n="357" facs="0406" xml:id="pg_357"/>
                        <p>Of course, we have many scholarship programs for graduate students, and
                            one idea would be merely to designate several graduate students who
                            already have scholarships to the U.S., as Humphrey Scholars. The
                            “Humphrey Scholarship” designation would be a prestigious one, and
                            perhaps it could include a special one-month seminar each year where
                            North-South problems could be addressed. Such a program would be very
                            inexpensive, but might project the same symbol that we would like to
                            project with a more extensive and expensive undergraduate program.

                                >HEW</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> all commented

                            excellent one, but too expensive. All those agencies preferred a
                            graduate program instead. I have re-evaluated the original <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> proposal and now concur with the other
                            agencies that a graduate program would be more desirable.</p>

                    <p>This is the fourteenth regular report of the U.S. Advisory Commission on
                        International Educational and Cultural Affairs. It is also its last.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s Reorganization
                        Plan No. 2 proposed that the U.S. Advisory Commission on International
                        Educational and Cultural Affairs and the U.S. Advisory Commission on
                        Information be replaced by one body, the U.S. Advisory Commission on
                        International Communication, Cultural and Educational Affairs.<note n="2"

                        marked the terminal date of the life of our Commission.</p>
                    <p>This situation has inevitably conditioned the form and substance of this
                        final report. The Commission’s enabling legislation (<gloss target="#t_PL_1"
                            >P.L</gloss>. 87–256, the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act
                        of 1961) stipulates that the Commission submit to the Congress an annual
                        report of its activities and recommendations. This document fulfills this
                        requirement by outlining its work since July 1, 1977. But the Commission
                        feels that, since this will be the final report of an organization which has
                        had a productive life for almost 16 years, it has additional obligations
                        to:</p>
                    <p>• Make some observations on the work of the Commission during its long
                        life;</p>
                    <p>• Pass on to its successor suggestions for its operation which stem from the
                        Commission’s long experience.</p>
                    <p>These two subjects are, therefore, dealt with in the pages that follow.</p>
                    <pb n="359" facs="0408" xml:id="pg_359"/>
                    <p>In one important respect, however, this report follows a well-established
                        precedent. It has become a tradition for the Commission to comment in its
                        annual accounting to the Congress on the general climate for this country’s
                        international educational and cultural exchange programs and their place in
                        the implementation of U.S. foreign policy. We do not believe this is the
                        moment to depart from this salutary tradition.</p>
                    <p>Over the years this Commission has spoken frequently of the “growing
                        interdependence” of the world and has insisted upon the importance of
                        international exchange in the development of the “mutual understanding” so
                        essential to such a world. But its voice is no longer, as we once felt it
                        was, a voice crying in the wilderness. On the contrary, there has been in
                        recent years so much talk about interdependence and mutual understanding,
                        that these words risk becoming pious platitudes, about as likely to stir
                        controversy—or action—as sin and motherhood.</p>
                    <p>For this reason, the Commission wishes in this final report to reiterate in
                        the strongest possible terms its continuing conviction that now, more than
                        ever before, this country must rely upon international educational and
                        cultural exchange to provide foreign audiences with accurate perceptions of
                        the United States, and to provide American audiences with accurate
                        perceptions of other nations.</p>
                    <p>In the first years of the 20th century, “splendid isolationism” seemed to
                        most Americans a sound basis for a viable foreign policy. World War II put a
                        sudden and unhappy end to this illusion. In the years immediately following
                        the war, America’s unprecedented military and economic power lulled many of
                        us into the smug belief that we could create a pax Americana simply by
                        “telling America’s story to the world.” That dream, too, was shattered by
                        events. Other countries grew in power and influence and became disinclined
                        to accept our bland assumption that the United States had all the answers.

                    <p>The use of exchanges as a tool of foreign policy cannot be called “new.” It
                        has been used by the United States to some extent for 40 years; and indeed
                        previous Presidents have acknowledged its worth. In a letter addressed to

                        exchanges to foreign policy; for giving increased emphasis to international
                        educational and cultural exchange is, we contend, one of the most obvious
                        ways to achieve the open, candid, globally involved policy which the
                        President advocates. <pb n="361" facs="0410" xml:id="pg_361"/>The Commission
                        therefore notes with satisfaction what appears to be a new awareness on the
                        part of the Congress, the Administration, and the public that exchanges can
                        help us to keep open channels of communication with other countries,
                        enabling us to talk directly to other peoples, to state our views and listen
                        to theirs, to avoid misunderstandings—in short, to serve our long-term
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>Last June our <hi rend="italic">Thirteenth Report</hi> noted that:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>We feel encouraged to believe that the importance of “public diplomacy,”
                            of which international exchange is an important part, is gaining the
                            recognition it deserves in our foreign policy. We do not believe that
                            this is a partisan development attributable solely to a change in
                            Administrations; and yet it is true that the Administration appears
                            ready to breathe new life into the exchange program . . .</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Subsequent events have justified our cautious optimism. The number of foreign
                        students coming to the United States has grown steadily. A consortium of
                        leading associations in U.S. higher education has undertaken to identify
                        positions which colleges and universities all over the world should be
                        taking to meet the needs of an interdependent community of nations. A report
                        of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities endorses
                        “educating students for a highly multicultural and interdependent world as
                        one of the top priorities of U.S. higher education.”</p>
                    <p>Our Government has reflected the attitude of the private sector. The first
                        recommendation of the Commission’s previous report was that the Congress
                        appropriate as a minimum for the exchange program the $70.5 million
                        authorized by the Office of Management and Budget (<gloss target="#t_OMB_1"
                            >OMB</gloss>), as opposed to the fiscal year 1977 appropriation of $59
                        million. Congress did appropriate the requested amount, thus encouraging the
                        State Department to ask for $74,750,000 for fiscal year 1979.</p>
                    <p>The President’s personal support of the Friendship Force led to several
                        massive, well-publicized, people-to-people exchanges. The House Subcommittee
                        on International Operations wrote to the President after 10 days of hearings
                        on Reorganization Plan No. 2, “The key to effective use of our public
                        diplomacy resources is an awareness of the utility of these resources and a
                        willingness to use them to further policy objectives.”</p>
                    <p>This statement confirms our belief that Reorganization Plan No. 2 is the most
                        significant development since 1953 affecting our exchange programs. It
                        therefore deserves special attention in this report. Although the plan dealt
                        specifically only with the management of a certain segment of the
                        Government’s exchange and information programs, the discussions which
                        preceded and succeeded the President’s recommendation on the reorganization
                        focused on the purposes and principles of educational and cultural exchange
                        more public and private <pb n="362" facs="0411" xml:id="pg_362"/>attention
                        than the subjects have probably ever before received in this country.</p>
                    <p>In the introduction to its <hi rend="italic">Thirteenth Report</hi>, the
                        Commission noted the impetus which its recommendation had given to a
                        thorough study of our Government’s handling of its international
                        information, educational and cultural programs, and summarized the actions
                        which its initiatives had precipitated. This section of the report
                        concluded: “It is therefore reasonable to expect that by the end of this
                        year our Government will be better organized to exploit the possibilities of
                        public diplomacy.”</p>
                    <p>That expectation came close to realization. On October 11, 1977, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> sent Reorganization Plan
                        No. 2 to the Congress and released it to the public. Almost immediately
                        committees of the House and Senate began hearings on it. The Chairman of the
                        Commission contributed to these in a letter addressed to Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_RAA_1">Ribicoff</persName>, Chairman of the Senate
                        Governmental Affairs Committee. Simultaneously, many private organizations
                        (principally from the academic community) made known their views. The
                        hearings and the interventions of the academic community addressed basic
                        questions of the role of international exchange in foreign affairs, as well
                        as the structuring of Government to manage them. Paramount among these was
                        one which particularly concerned this Commission: how to obtain genuine
                        coordination of our information and cultural activities while at the same
                        time retaining the integrity of the exchange programs.</p>
                    <p>As a result of these public and private observations, the President made
                        several amendments to his proposal, and Reorganization Plan No. 2 was
                        approved by the Congress on December 11, 1977. It established a new agency,
                        the International Communication Agency (<gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                        >ICA</gloss>), which “will have two distinct but related goals: to tell the
                        world about our society and policies; . . . to tell ourselves about the
                        world . . . The aim of this reorganization, therefore, is a more effective
                        dialogue among peoples of the earth.”</p>
                    <p>An analysis of the plan is not pertinent to our interests here, and we have
                        dwelt this long on it only to support our thesis that the time is ripe for
                        the United States to, at long last, assure that international educational
                        and cultural exchange is fully recognized as an essential element in the
                        determination and implementation of U.S. foreign policy—and is utilized
                        accordingly. Thanks largely to Reorganization Plan No. 2, influential
                        members of Congress and the Executive Branch are alert as never before to
                        the possibilities; and an agency has been established which has the
                        potential to conduct exchange programs with maximum effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>In short, we tend to think that exchange programs between this and other
                        countries of the world have come of age. What we now need <pb n="363"
                            facs="0412" xml:id="pg_363"/>to do is to assure that the interchange of
                        scholars and scholarly materials which takes place within our borders is
                        carried out internationally. This would, we firmly believe, lead to a more
                        mature relationship between the United States and other countries; one in
                        which human rights and a greater awareness of the need for individuals to be
                        genuinely free to move and speak as they wish would be generally
                        accepted.</p>
                    <p>These thoughts lead us to the first and most significant, recommendation of
                        this report. <hi rend="italic">We recommend that the Congress and our
                            successor Advisory Commission supervise closely over the next year the
                            operations of the newly established International Communication
                            Agency</hi> to make certain that the international educational and
                        cultural programs for which it is responsible do indeed—as Reorganization
                        Plan No. 2 projects—“play a central role in building 2-way bridges of
                        understanding between our people and other peoples of the world.”</p>

                    <p>Welcome to the International Communication Agency.</p>
                    <p>Today is our first day of business. For me, it is a day of great excitement,
                        brimming with a sense of challenge. For me, it is a rare day of renewed
                        commitment to values and ideas and purposes with which many of us have been
                        engaged for the better part of our professional lives.</p>
                    <p>I do not take this day lightly. I believe that we and others may later look
                        back on this day as having been of historic significance.</p>
                    <pb n="364" facs="0413" xml:id="pg_364"/>
                    <p>It is because of this conviction that I want to talk to you at some length
                        this morning—our first morning together—on three matters I judge to be of
                        concern to us all.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, I should like to present some of my own
                        personal beliefs. I hope they will have an impact on the initial directions
                        of the International Communication Agency.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, I should like to outline what I see as the
                        potential of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> as an institution.</p>
                    <p>And, <hi rend="italic">third</hi>, I should like to lay out what I view as
                        some of the more important practical implications of this act of
                        creation—the establishment of the International Communication Agency.</p>
                    <p>First, then, my beliefs:</p>
                    <p>I believe in the power of ideas. I believe that ideas are what the
                        International Communication Agency is all about—the generation of ideas, the
                        exchange of ideas, the refinement of ideas. In the ebbs and flows of
                        history, there are those who place their trust in military might, those who
                        lean to economic determinism, those whose ultimate regard is for scientific
                        and technological innovation.</p>
                    <p>I turn to ideas. I believe, with Oliver Wendell Holmes, that “man’s mind,
                        stretched to a new idea, never goes back to its original dimension.” I
                        believe, with H.G. Wells, that, “Human history is in essence a history of
                        ideas.” I believe, with President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName>, that “it is a mistake to undervalue the power of
                        words and of the ideas that words embody.”<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">The
                            President made this statement during his May 22, 1977, commencement
                            address to graduates of the University of Notre Dame. See <ref
                                target="#d57fn2">footnote 2, Document 57</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I also believe that the human personality, and human creativity, and human
                        well-being flourish best where humane values and the rule of law—in their
                        fullest sense—also flourish.</p>
                    <p>I believe it imperative—and in our highest national interest—to enhance the
                        sensitivity, the insight and the understanding that Americans bring to their
                        relations with other peoples. As President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> has said, “only by knowing and understanding each
                        other’s experiences can we find common ground on which we can examine and
                        resolve our differences.”<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">The President made
                            this statement in the message to Congress, transmitting the text of
                            Reorganization Plan Number 2; see <ref target="#d93">Document
                            93</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I also believe it imperative that other societies know clearly where we stand
                        and why—as a government and as a people—on issues of concern, just as I
                        believe it inevitable that other societies, in their own interests, will
                        want to know. An important part of our mandate continues to be the
                        obligation to explain American policies as clearly and effectively as we
                        can.</p>
                    <pb n="365" facs="0414" xml:id="pg_365"/>
                    <p>I believe that America has given birth to one of the most dynamic, most
                        creative cultures since the Renaissance—but I also believe that no culture
                        is so fully cultivated that it cannot be further enriched by the cultures of
                        others.</p>
                    <p>I believe that, where they are properly rooted, cultural relations among
                        peoples are more fundamental, more lasting than any other form of contact
                        across national boundaries. Likewise, I believe that a people’s cultural
                        achievements are both the most important statements they can make about
                        themselves and the most meaningful statements that can be made about them by
                        others.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the most effective means of communication is direct and
                        personal. As <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Edward R. Murrow</persName> once
                        said, in communicating across vast distances, the last three feet are the
                        hardest and most important. A superb film or a superb magazine or a superb
                        book—however valuable in its own right—is no substitute for a superb
                        discussion among individuals. That is why our exchange of persons programs,
                        and our colleagues in the field, and Americans voluntarily participating
                        with us here at home are so central to our work.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the world has changed, and that Americans have changed with
                        it. We now know that what we and others do as nations affects each other in
                        historically unparalleled ways. We recognize that people—both at home and
                        abroad—are demanding as never before to be involved in the overriding
                        decisions that affect their lives. We appreciate—more fully than ever—that
                        we cannot live free of foreign entanglements and, at the same time, that we
                        cannot work our will unfettered on others.</p>
                    <p>I believe, above all, that the work we do can and does make a difference.
                        Surely there will always be real conflicts of interest among peoples. But I
                        believe that we can play a profound role in helping to reduce a multitude of
                        conflicts that arise largely, if not entirely, from misunderstandings and
                        misperceptions among people. And I believe we can make an essential
                        contribution to the creation of an international environment in which real
                        differences are worked out rationally, sensitively and peaceably.</p>
                    <p>Consider for a moment:</p>
                    <p>—Would the controversy over landing rights for the Concorde in New York City
                        have raged quite so emotionally, or proved quite so intractable, if some
                        representative sample of the citizens of Queens had visited for a period
                        with their counterparts in Toulouse?</p>
                    <p>—Would the peace initiative undertaken by President Sadat<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d125fn4">Reference is to Sadat’s November 19, 1977, trip to
                            Jerusalem, making him the first Arab leader ever to officially visit the

                    <p>—Could the problems of the world economy be dealt with more sensitively and
                        more successfully if economists and businessmen and workers from around the
                        world were brought together more frequently and more purposefully to discuss
                        issues of overriding common concern?</p>
                    <p>We can all pick our examples. But the conclusion, I believe, is inescapable:
                        traditional, government-to-government diplomacy is no island unto itself. It
                        does not operate in a vacuum. Indeed, its success or failure is shaped by
                        the international environment in which it is conducted. The relations among
                        peoples; the hopes, the aspirations and the perceptions of different
                        societies; the extent to which people know and understand and have contact
                        with each other—these provide the context within which traditional diplomacy
                        operates, the fundamental building blocks of the international environment.
                        This is our work, and in an important sense traditional diplomacy is our
                        handmaiden, not the reverse. What could be more exciting or more challenging
                        than to be mandated to shape the basic forces in our relations with other
                        peoples?</p>
                    <p>This should give you some sense of my view of the potential of <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> as an institution—a potential, I believe,
                        that is limited only by our answers to four questions:</p>
                    <p>• How imposing an institution do we wish to create?</p>
                    <p>• How central do we wish to be in determining relations between our society
                        and others?</p>
                    <p>• How great a contribution is each of us prepared to make to the task?</p>
                    <p>• What kind of an institution, doing what kind of work, at what level of
                        importance, do we want to look back upon in five or ten years?</p>
                    <p>As I see it, the President and others can look first to <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> for advice on the conduct of our overall
                        cultural relations with other societies.</p>
                    <p>The President and others can look first to <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> for essential insights on foreign attitudes, aspirations
                        and opinions.</p>
                    <p>The President and others can look first to <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> for sound counsel on the development and implementation of
                        international communications policies.</p>
                    <p>The President and others should look routinely to <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> as a source of original thought on major international
                        initiatives.</p>
                    <p>The President and others—including a wide array of people and institutions
                        throughout our society—can look first to <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> as a principal vehicle for enhancing our knowledge and
                        understanding of other peoples.</p>
                    <p>The President and others, in short, can view <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> as an Agency of singular importance in our dealings with
                        other nations and other peoples.</p>

                    <p>Given its mission, given the activities in which it is engaged, given your
                        talents and dedication and experience, <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>
                        can and should be the single most exciting institution in government in
                        which to work.</p>
                    <p>That is my vision of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>’s potential. I
                        believe it reasonable. I encourage you to share it, and I submit that,
                        working together, we can convert this vision into reality.</p>
                    <p>Some thirty years ago, Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2">J. William
                            Fulbright</persName> also had a vision. Many of you have played a role
                        in bringing that vision to life. Your work has left a unique mark on the
                        world. I believe it to be among the most important contributions that we as
                        a people have made to ourselves and to others since the end of World War II.
                        And now, if our vision is as compelling as was Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName>’s, if we are as dedicated as he
                        and others have been over more than three decades, then I believe we can and
                        will succeed.</p>
                    <p>What, then, are the practical implications for our work? I do not pretend to
                        have a definitive answer today. Surely, we all have much to learn. Some
                        things we shall try, find them lacking and change. Other approaches will
                        occur to us only with experience. Nonetheless, I believe there are some
                        principles worth noting.</p>
                    <p>First, we must think and act from the beginning as a single, integrated
                        organization. Reorganization is behind us. The United States Information
                        Agency, the United States Information Service and the Bureau of Educational
                        and Cultural Affairs no longer exist. However fond we were of those
                        institutions (and I was exceedingly fond of them), whatever value we placed
                        on their work (and I placed a great deal), however much of our time and
                        energy and emotion we devoted to them (and I devoted a healthy amount of all
                        three), they are now history—proud history, to be sure, history on which we
                        can build, but nonetheless history.</p>
                    <p>Today, we embark on an act of creation. We have a new Agency, a single
                        Agency, an integrated Agency. This reality should govern our policies, our
                        programs, our relationships with each other. We should no longer think of
                        ourselves as engaged in information work or educational work or cultural
                        work. We are engaged in communication with other peoples.</p>
                    <p>Second, we must be more disciplined than we have been in the past. We must
                        examine, evaluate, critique what we are doing and why. We must ask ourselves
                        how the American taxpayer will benefit from any particular proposal or
                        program. We must be aware that the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of our
                        activities does not necessarily reflect, indeed it may hinder, the <hi
                            rend="italic">quality</hi> of our activities.</p>
                    <p>It is for reasons of discipline that the International Communication Agency
                        has been structured so as to reduce self-contained power cen<pb n="368"
                            facs="0417" xml:id="pg_368"/>ters. It is for reasons of discipline that
                        posts abroad must proceed with their program planning in the first instance
                        from Ambassadors’ goals and objectives. It is for reasons of discipline that
                        effective influence structure analyses and audience record systems will be
                        required. It is for reasons of discipline that the acquisition and
                        production of media products in mutually re-inforcing ways are essential. It
                        is for reasons of discipline that all of our activities must be linked to
                        strategic policies derived from a thorough, research-based understanding of
                        the common concerns and the communication tensions between our society and
                        others.</p>
                    <p>Third, many of us must think and act differently than we have in the past.
                        This necessity derives from the fact that we are a new, single, integrated
                        organization mandated, as the President has made clear:</p>
                    <p>—“To tell the world about our society and policies—in particular our
                        commitment to cultural diversity and individual liberty.</p>
                    <p>—“To tell ourselves about the world, so as to enrich our own culture as well
                        as to give us the understanding to deal effectively with problems among
                        nations.”</p>
                    <p>Neither <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> nor the Bureau of Educational
                        and Cultural Affairs was charged with this twin mandate. The International
                        Communication Agency is.</p>
                    <p>Some will contend that <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> abroad had long
                        been engaged in two-way communication. Undeniably, it was for many years the
                        overseas executor of the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> program.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s focus was always
                        fundamentally one-way. Its mission was to tell others about <hi
                            rend="italic">our</hi> policies and <hi rend="italic">our</hi>
                        societies. To the extent that engaging others in a dialogue was seen as an
                        essential tool for accomplishing this purpose, it was utilized and rightly
                        so.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, the International Communication Agency has two-way communication
                        as a fundamental principle of its mission and its activities. Speakers sent
                        abroad, seminars held abroad, visitors brought to this country—our
                        activities and programs as a whole should be designed to learn as well as to
                        inform, and to inform as well as to learn.</p>
                    <p>The Voice of America, to give but one example, has always been—and no doubt
                        will continue to be—primarily a one-way medium. It will not broadcast to the
                        American people. Yet people at the Voice have been thinking creatively about
                        the possibilities of using the Voice to involve foreigners in its
                        programming in ways never before attempted.</p>
                    <p>What can the Television and Film Service do along these lines? What can the
                        Press and Publications Service do? What can each of us do to promote more
                        effective interaction with the peoples of other countries? That is a
                        question that should suffuse the thinking of every<pb n="369" facs="0418"
                            xml:id="pg_369"/>one in the International Communication Agency—every
                        post, every employee, every element.</p>
                    <p>I can think of no more inspiring or meaningful guideline for our work,
                        nothing that is more consistent with the American character, American
                        values, or American social and political processes, than the words of John
                        Stuart Mill: “Not the violent conflict between parts of the truth,” Mill
                        said, “but the quiet suppression of half of it, is the formidable evil;
                        there is always hope when people are forced to listen to both sides; it is
                        when they attend only to one that errors harden into prejudices, and truth
                        itself ceases to have the effect of truth, by being exaggerated into
                            falsehood.”<note n="5" xml:id="d125fn5">John Stuart Mill, <hi
                                rend="italic">On Liberty</hi>, 1859.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Let me now turn to specific guidelines for the new Agency. They can best be
                        outlined in terms of each of its major elements.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">From the Associate Directorate for Programs</hi>, we
                        expect:</p>
                    <p>—the development of coordinated programs derived from the most accurate,
                        comprehensive knowledge we can acquire of foreign attitudes, perceptions and
                        opinions, and of the nature of foreign communications environments;</p>
                    <p>—assistance for our posts abroad in understanding and explaining American
                        policies;</p>
                    <p>—close familiarity with the most dynamic and representative aspects of
                        American social, political and cultural ideas; if we are to share with
                        others an accurate, balanced understanding of American society, <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> must have an effective capability for
                        assessing what it is we need to say about so rich and diverse and creative a
                        society;</p>
                    <p>—a focussing of the extraordinary creativity of our media elements;</p>
                    <p>—a firm emphasis on acquiring from the vast storehouse of the American
                        private sector, producing only what is essential to our programs and is
                        unavailable elsewhere;</p>
                    <p>—more effective response to the program needs of our posts; Washington should
                        not forget that it is largely in the field that <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss>’s work will be done, that Washington exists primarily to
                        provide strategic policy direction and support to field work;</p>
                    <p>—a capacity to assure that <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> makes its
                        proper contribution to the development of government-wide international
                        communications policies in such areas as the development of Third World
                        media, the World Administrative Radio Conference, transborder data flows,
                        the transfer of technology through educational and scientific exchange
                        programs and the use of direct broadcast satellites; since we are the only
                        government Agency exclusively mandated to focus on the <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>—a safeguarding of the integrity and the non-political character of our
                        educational and cultural exchange programs;</p>
                    <p>—a thorough evaluation, refinement and possible expansion of our exchange
                        programs and our assistance to Voluntry Visitors in this country;</p>
                    <p>—a significant upgrading of our work with private institutions in this
                        country and abroad, helping where we can to forge enduring links across
                        national boundaries;</p>
                    <p>—the careful, prudent selection of contract agencies to help us with our work
                        and the continuous, effective monitoring of these agencies so as to insure
                        that both we and the taxpayers are being properly served;</p>
                    <p>—the development and implementation of sound policies for our libraries, our
                        book programs, our English-teaching and American Studies programs
                        abroad;</p>
                    <p>—assistance in coordinating and setting policy standards for the exchange
                        programs of all agencies of the government;</p>
                    <p>—close working relationships with others in the Agency, in particular the

                        possible;</p>
                    <p>—creative thinking as to how the Voice of America might be utilized as a
                        vehicle for international dialogue.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">From the Associate Directorate for Management</hi>, we
                        expect the following:</p>
                    <p>—a disciplined but fair personnel system, responsive both to the interests of
                        the individual employee and to the interests of the Agency; our employees,
                        including our foreign colleagues at posts abroad, are our most valuable
                        resource; people must be recruited, assigned and promoted by a system that
                        is understood, predictable, sensitive to individual skills and circumstances
                        and as free as possible from tampering; above all, employees must perceive
                        and believe that the system is fair and resistant to manipulation;</p>
                    <p>—a training program designed to supply the Agency with the employees and the
                        skills needed to engage effectively in cross-cultural communication;</p>
                    <p>—technological and management information systems appropriate to our work,
                        systems that are neither 20 years out of date nor more sophisticated than
                        our tasks require, systems which facilitate our work rather than adding to
                        it;</p>
                    <p>—a budget and resource allocation system that is responsible and responsive;
                        I consider zero base budgeting to be one of the most effective disciplinary
                        tools at our disposal; I intend that it should be utilized effectively;</p>
                    <p>—administrative procedures and systems supportive of the varied needs of an
                        Agency with 10 separate locations in Washington and 189 posts in 120
                        countries around the world.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">From our area offices</hi>, we expect:</p>
                    <p>—a focus on truly strategic communication problems;</p>
                    <p>—rapid assistance to posts on major policy issues;</p>
                    <p>—an effective contribution to the development of major initiatives to be
                        considered by the President, the Secretary of State and others; if we as an
                        Agency wish to play a prominent role in the government’s policy process, the
                        precondition is our ability to generate policy ideas that command
                        attention;</p>
                    <p>—effective management of resources, always linking our resources to strategic
                        issues and problems, viewed and articulated whole;</p>
                    <p>—effective implementation of decisions made by management, together with
                        advice, based on area and field perspectives, in the making of these
                        decisions;</p>
                    <p>—fruitful relationships with domestic American organizations and individuals
                        with an interest in particular areas of the world;</p>
                    <p>—effective working relationships with our counterparts at the Department of
                        State and the National Security Council;</p>
                    <p>—clearly defined objectives based on a rigorous analysis of communication
                        tensions between the United States and other societies and <pb n="372"

                            >quality</hi> of our communication with these societies.</p>
                    <p>Finally, and in the knowledge that no single asset is as precious as our
                        presence abroad, what do we expect <hi rend="italic">from our posts
                            abroad</hi>?</p>
                    <p>—the effective conduct of daily business, while at the same time insuring
                        that every decision is made, every activity is undertaken, in light of where
                        we want to be in the longer term; we can all, certainly, find ways to keep
                        busy; but we must recognize the need to free up more of our time for
                        reflection on ultimate purpose; we must pay attention to the fact that
                        communication is not a singular event, or even a series of singular events,
                        but a continuing process requiring constant thought and constant refinement;
                        the question is not how many people see a film or come into a library or
                        attend a seminar; the question is one of purpose, consistency with our
                        overall goals, meaningful accomplishment of our mission;</p>
                    <p>—a focus on communication issues and on personal contacts; a <gloss
                            target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> and his colleagues must not allow
                        themselves to get so caught up in the <hi rend="italic">techniques</hi> of
                        communication that they lose sight of the <hi rend="italic">content</hi> and
                            <hi rend="italic">purpose</hi> of communication;</p>
                    <p>—the clearest possible explanation to foreigners of where this great country
                        stands, and why;</p>
                    <p>—the development of fully integrated programs tied to U.S. policy objectives
                        and to the national interest; our new mission demands that our activities be
                        centered on learning as well as informing; post organization and programs
                        must reflect this new mission;</p>
                    <p>—a more careful definition of those whom we want to engage in a dialogue,
                        together with the operation of an effective audience record system and an
                        effective outreach program; we simply do not have the resources—human or
                        financial—to do our work successfully without such definitions and such
                        systems;</p>
                    <p>—an effective contribution to our understanding of other peoples, based on
                        wide-ranging personal contacts, systematic research and rigorous analytical
                        thinking;</p>
                    <p>—an effective contribution to important policy initiatives at all levels; an
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> post should be perceived by all
                        Ambassadors, as it already is by some, as the single most important element
                        of the U.S. mission abroad.</p>
                    <p>I do not want to leave the impression that these expectations are entirely
                        new, or that they have not necessarily been fulfilled in the past. In part,
                        at least, they derive from exceptional work already carried out
                        overseas.</p>
                    <p>—Posts like those in Yugoslavia, India, the United Arab Emirates and Trinidad
                        have demonstrated just how invaluable an audience record system can be;</p>
                    <pb n="373" facs="0422" xml:id="pg_373"/>
                    <p>—Posts like those in Turkey and Singapore and Israel have shown how much can
                        be accomplished through effective outreach programs;</p>
                    <p>—Posts like those in the Philippines and Gabon and Malta have illustrated the
                        value of focussing on personal contacts.</p>
                    <p>—Posts like those in Bonn, Mexico, Japan and, again, India have excelled at
                        integrated programs.</p>
                    <p>—Employees throughout <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, including many of our foreign colleagues at
                        posts abroad, have demonstrated the skills and incorporated the approaches
                        required in the International Communication Agency.</p>
                    <p>This list of achievements is by no means complete. It is meant simply to be
                        illustrative. Nonetheless, our performance in Washington and in the field is
                        far from uniform, either in quality or in focus. We have a new organization
                        and a new mission. And I think it only fair that we all understand what is
                        expected from the outset in the International Communication Agency.</p>
                    <p>I have talked at length with you this morning. Still it is only a beginning.
                        You will all recognize that I have but skimmed the surface. There are
                        details to be worked out, questions to be raised, answers to be found—many
                        more than we can deal with today.</p>
                    <p>I trust, however, that I have given you a framework. I hope I have conveyed a
                        sense of direction, a sense of potential.</p>
                    <p>Before concluding, there are several other points I would like to touch on
                        very briefly.</p>
                    <p>First, I should like say a few words about our relationship to the Department
                        of State. The International Communication Agency is an independent agency of
                        the Federal Government. It is responsible for its own budget, its own
                        personnel system, its own programs. Its Director reports both to the
                        President and to the Secretary of State. It is from the Secretary of State
                        that we shall seek and receive guidance on the foreign policies and
                        interests of the United States.</p>
                    <p>I look forward to the closest, most collegial working relationship with the
                        Department of State. I think it highly desirable that we have an equitable
                        interchange of officers and employees with our sister institution. Our work,
                        and our mission, are different from those of the Department. But they are
                        closely related. We must work cooperatively with the Department of State at
                        all times and at all levels.</p>
                    <p>Second, a personal confession: Over the past year, I have had to confine
                        myself far more than I would have liked to Washington. We have had a new
                        Administration, new policies emanating from that Administration, new
                        leadership in both <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> and, above all, a reorganization to work
                        out. All of this hindered the kind of direct personal involvement I would
                        have liked with our posts abroad. That <pb n="374" facs="0423"
                            xml:id="pg_374"/>is a condition I plan to remedy shortly. I will be
                        opening our exhibit in the Soviet Union, visiting several posts in Europe
                        and joining our European colleagues at a <gloss target="#t_PAO_1"
                            >PAO</gloss> conference in Brussels later this month.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d125fn6">References are to the “Agriculture-<gloss
                                target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” exhibit in Kiev, scheduled to open on
                            April 21, and the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> Conference in
                            Brussels, scheduled to take place April 28–30. The trip to Kiev marked
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>’s first overseas
                            trip as <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> Director. During 1978–1979,
                            the “Agriculture-<gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” exhibit also
                            traveled to Tselinograd, Dushanbe, Kishinev, Moscow, and
                            Rostov-on-Don.</note> The field can expect to see more of me in the year
                        ahead.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I want to end where I began this morning—with ideas. They are the
                        lifeblood of our Agency. They should be blossoming at all levels of our
                        Agency. One of the great advantages of a new beginning like ours is that we
                        can generate ideas together. We have a new mission and we must now, jointly,
                        give this mission life and meaning. In so doing, we are limited only by our
                        imaginations. New ideas may not always be adopted, but they will always be
                        welcome. I encourage each of you to think imaginatively about what we can do
                        differently, how we can do better.</p>
                    <p>We are confronted with a rare, open moment in history. That prospect is
                        challenging. Whether and how we seize the moment is largely up to us. It
                        will be a test of our beliefs, our vision, our will—and, surely, of our
                        energies.</p>
                    <p>I am reminded, in closing, of a story I first heard some 20 years ago when I
                        arrived in the Philippines as a new employee of the United States
                        Government. Some of you may be familiar with it. The story is about the
                        journey of a traveler across a vast and lonely plain. In his progress, the
                        traveler comes across workers cutting stone. And of each he asks: “What are
                        you doing?” Repeatedly, he is told: “Can’t you see? I am cutting stone.”
                        Finally, he stops once again and asks: “What are you doing?” And this time
                        the reply is different: “I,” says the worker, “am building a cathedral.”</p>
                    <p>Our choice is similar. We can see ourselves as stone-cutters; or we can be
                        cathedral builders. I hope it will be said of all of us that we fashioned a
                        cathedral.</p>
                    <p>We begin a new adventure today. We have a new Agency, at an inviting moment
                        in history. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> has
                        charged us with an exciting mission. He has wished us the best. I take great
                        pride in working with you. Now let us be about our work.</p>
                    <p>Thank you.</p>

                    <p>Some time ago I asked a State-<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> group to
                        examine the adequacy of State policy guidance to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> media, as an element of the Department’s obligation to
                        provide policy guidance to <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I have now received and reviewed the group’s report, and have consulted
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> on its suggestions.<note n="2"

                    <p>As a result of this process of consultation, I am requesting appropriate

                    <p>We have given considerable thought to the three options offered in the

                            >Humphrey</persName>’s life-long interest in public service. This option
                        offers one-year specialized training in disciplines directly related to

                            Service</p>
                        <p>We take it as given that our purposes (as articulated in the April 17
                            memo) are to help educate a core group of a new generation of developing
                            world leaders, to provide a <hi rend="italic">compelling</hi> symbol of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interest in the developing world,
                            to narrow the educational gap between industrialized and developing
                            countries, and to provide an American education to the talented poor in
                            these countries. These useful purposes could be served by a direct focus
                            on those who by their own career choice have already indicated that they
                            can respond to our objectives.</p>
                        <p>We can provide an opportunity to those who will be able to enhance their
                            ability to contribute to public service in their own country, who will
                            be able to provide mature and thoughtful perspectives to the Americans
                            with whom they will come into contact in the course of the program, and
                            who will constitute a growing infrastructure of human resources which
                            could contribute to continuing cooperation among governments.</p>
                        <pb n="380" facs="0429" xml:id="pg_380"/>
                        <p>To meet this need we can look to those American educational institutions
                            which offer appealing programs for young professionals, age 25–35, who
                            have dedicated their careers to public service in government or
                            quasi-governmental organizations. There is no reason why foreign
                            professionals should not participate more fully—indeed, there is much to
                            be gained by the institutions and the American participants, as well as
                            the foreign students, from interaction with foreign grantees. The
                            disciplines which such courses could cover include (but need not be
                            limited to) public administration, development economics, public health
                            administration, communication and journalism, social work and
                            educational administration.</p>
                        <p>Participants in these programs would qualify as “poor”—they certainly
                            could not afford this type of “topping-off” education on their own. It
                            will not be difficult to select the outstanding among them since their
                            decision to participate in public service will already have served to
                            select them from the average.</p>
                        <p>A number of American universities and colleges now offer relevant
                            programs and others could be included. Among those are: a course in
                            development economics at Williams College; a course in management
                            responsibility offered through the Sloan Fellows Program at <gloss
                                target="#t_MIT_1">MIT</gloss>; the industrial development program at
                            the Georgia Institute of Technology; the professional studies in
                            international development at Cornell; the Nieman journalism courses at
                            Harvard; and the courses in international economic development at North
                            Carolina A and T at Greensboro. To the extent that we involve
                            communication officials, some long-range contributions might be made
                            toward solving the problems of North-South communications interaction
                            which permeated the discussions at the <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1"
                                >UNESCO</gloss> General Conference at Nairobi in 1976 and would

                        </p>
                        <p>This option has several advantages:</p>
                        <p>(a) The direct address to those already in public service honors the late
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName>’s lifelong
                            interest and achievement in this field;</p>
                        <p>(b) It addresses the real, present need for skills in the public sector
                            of developing countries, links the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to
                            present and future “influentials”—and thus serves demonstrable mutual
                            interests;</p>
                        <p>(c) The broad range of disciplines and subject matter can be tailored to
                            meet the needs of a large number of developing countries;</p>
                        <p>(d) The course can be completed in one academic year thereby reducing
                            both the cost and the likelihood of non-return;</p>
                        <pb n="381" facs="0430" xml:id="pg_381"/>
                        <p>(e) The experience will give participants, educated in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, a competitive—and welcome—advantage
                            over peers in foreign governmental structures;</p>
                        <p>(f) There presently exist mechanisms in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> Government and associated entities (binational

                    <p>Social, economic and political problems affect the current Atlantic
                        relationship. Beyond that, there is a growing concern that younger Europeans
                        and Americans—members of “the successor generation”—increasingly question
                        the assumptions and values that have sustained that relationship and the
                        effectiveness of at least some democratic institutions. Among younger
                        Europeans, the U.S. is often viewed through the prisms of Vietnam, Watergate
                        and anti-capitalist sentiment.</p>
                    <p>These problems could usefully be addressed at the highest levels of political
                        leadership, perhaps in relation to the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and Economic Summits.</p>
                    <p>We recommend an initiative to mobilize creative and intellectual resources on
                        both sides of the Atlantic in a kind of “<persName corresp="#p_MGC_1"

                        While the initial thrust would come from the U.S., European commitment
                        would—as in the 1940’s—be an essential element.</p>

                        President could plan a speech at an appropriate European venue, such as a
                        major university, to articulate the challenges facing modern societies,
                        affirm the commitment of the West to its democratic institutions and
                        reaffirm the enduring values on which they are based. Major European leaders
                        should be primed to respond immediately and in kind (the Japanese could
                        logically be included in any initiative, in which case commitments of the
                        kind described below could even figure in the Summit itself and the
                        communique).</p>
                    <p>In his speech the President could:</p>
                    <p>—Name several outstanding “successor generation” Americans to meet with
                        European counterparts selected by their governments as a first step in a
                        consultative process. The group would develop an agenda for future Atlantic
                        (or <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>) cooperation in this area by the
                        end of 1978. It would form the nucleus of a convocation of Americans and
                        Europeans (hereafter in the memo, one could substitute <gloss
                            target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> for “Europe” or “Europeans”) who would
                        meet within 12 months—perhaps in conjunction with an Economic Summit in
                        1979—to evaluate work in progress and make further recommendations.</p>
                    <p>—Announce (contingent upon a like European commitment) U.S. support for an
                        institute, possibly named for General <persName corresp="#p_MGC_1"
                            >Marshall</persName>, for promising young Europeans and Americans who
                        are likely to play important roles in the political and intellectual life of
                        their countries. The academy would be governed by a consortium of
                        U.S.-European universities and housed at two universities, one in the United
                        States and the other in Europe. In addition to providing appropriate
                        interdisciplinary training, the academy would offer these future leaders a
                        work experience at the local equivalent of state or federal levels in
                            participat<pb n="383" facs="0432" xml:id="pg_383"/>ing countries to
                        broaden both their experience and their understanding of foreign
                        institutions and government processes.</p>
                    <p>—The President could announce a cooperative effort to bring more Europeans
                        and Americans together through individual and institutional exchanges. Some
                        specific U.S. initiatives in this area (again, to be matched by a like
                        commitment) might be: (1) A 50% increase (to $6 million) in the funding of
                        exchange programs designed to bring together outstanding younger Europeans
                        and Americans active in political, intellectual and cultural life; (2) A
                        program to enhance institutional responsiveness in Europe and the U.S.
                        through (a) exchanges and internships in local and regional administration
                        via grants to state and municipal governments and (b) international seminars
                        to design enhanced service delivery systems from government; (3) Development
                        of internships and seminar programs to assist younger media figures to
                        understand, and ultimately reflect, the transatlantic reality; (4) Creation
                        of grants providing outstanding young European public servants with one-year
                        research fellowships in the U.S.; and (5) Programs to encourage European
                        participation in <gloss target="#t_ACTION_1">ACTION</gloss> volunteer
                        programs, and reciprocal involvement by Americans in like European
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, the President could announce initiatives to enhance the study of
                        U.S. and European languages and cultures. Specific initiatives on the U.S.
                        side might be: (1) U.S. government support for the development of summer
                        training institutes for European university faculty members involved in
                        training teachers of English; (2) Increased <gloss target="#t_HEW_1"
                            >HEW</gloss> (or Department of Education) support of foreign language
                        and area curricula in American universities.</p>
                    <p>Total additional <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> “start-up” funding in
                            <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1979</hi> is estimated conservatively
                        to be $10 million. Since no one participating country’s contribution is
                        likely to be large enough to capture attention—nor need it—our goal should
                        be the announcement of a joint U.S.-European program totalling $100 million
                        in the first year and announced as enduring over a period of 10 years.</p>
                    <p>All of the foregoing proposals could usefully be pursued without benefit of
                        involvement by the President. In terms of the demands on his time and
                        energy, however, the costs are low, the symbolic and political value
                        relatively high, and the positive image of transatlantic cooperation
                        presumably useful.</p>

                            printed in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                    >Nixon</persName>, 1972</hi>, pp. 633–634.</note> as a point of
                        departure. We believe such a proposal would have wide resonance in important
                        Third World countries such as India and Yugoslavia, as well as in
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p>We would hope that the speech would also touch on the following points which,
                        our analysis suggests, would elicit useful reaction:</p>
                    <p>—There is concern in a number of African countries, including the
                        anglophones, that lying behind the Soviet interest in at least limited
                        influence in Africa is a “grand design.” The speech could usefully raise the
                        question of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s hegemonial
                        intentions.</p>
                    <p>—The President might note that external forces invited into a conflict
                        situation for one purpose have been known to remain for other purposes. Most
                        African countries have their own splinter groups, ethnic or political, and
                        the President could usefully raise the question whether any of the world’s
                        countries wishes to have mercenary forces operating “in the neighborhood.”
                        This strikes us as a point on which to appeal to Third World
                        opinion—specifically including the Caribbean.</p>
                    <pb n="386" facs="0435" xml:id="pg_386"/>
                    <p>—Given Soviet sponsorship of the Cuban presence in Africa, it may be worth
                        calling into question Cuba’s “non-aligned” status. This point should be made
                        in low key, but followed up with private discussion (and particularly with
                        the Indians). Cuba attaches considerable importance to hosting the
                        Non-Aligned Conference in 1979.<note n="4" xml:id="d132fn4">Scheduled to

                    </p>
                    <p>—There appears to be—as yet unofficial—Eastern European concern with the
                        future of detente. Recognizing the delicacy of the matter, there may be some
                        utility in accentuating these concerns.</p>

                        the opportunity to object. There is nothing to object to and the letter does

                        see him in a few days.</p>
                    <p>The guidelines go to great length to define the status and responsibilities
                        of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> correspondents overseas as exactly
                        the same as all other journalists, including the principle that they are
                        denied diplomatic or <pb n="387" facs="0436" xml:id="pg_387"/>special
                        passports and use of facilities reserved for official Americans. Their
                        activities are not to be under the control of chiefs of mission in any
                        respect and they are to be controlled wholly from VOA/Washington.
                        Arrangements reminiscent for those for resolving disputes between COSs and
                        Ambassadors are provided in case of disputes—they are to be referred back to
                        Washington. The guidelines are thus consistently idealistic and reflect the
                        spirit of the times and the lofty principles which prevailed when the <gloss

                            to issue shortly, governing the role, status and responsibilities of
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> correspondents overseas.<note

                        <p>The purpose of these guidelines is to provide a much-needed clarification
                            of the position of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> foreign
                            correspondents, in order to insure fulfillment of the <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s legislated charter and the
                            President’s mandate that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> news
                            gathering and reporting functions be kept “independent and
                            objective.”</p>
                        <p>Essentially, the guidelines separate <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                            correspondents from official U.S. Missions abroad. They make it clear
                            that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> foreign correspondents are
                            government-employed journalists, not diplomats. They relieve the
                            Ambassador and his Mission colleagues from even the appearance of
                            responsibility for the content of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                            news broadcasts.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, the guidelines reemphasize the need for the
                            correspondent to inform the Mission prior to undertaking any coverage
                            which may be sensitive or controversial; they also reaffirm the right of
                            the Ambassador, through appropriate channels, to comment on or question
                            correspondent coverage.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that the new guidelines, which have been worked on with
                            care over many months, will help minimize, if not eliminate entirely,
                            the various disputes that have arisen from time to time over
                            correspondent activities. They will not, however, be universally
                            applauded at our overseas Missions. With this in mind, I have forwarded
                            a copy of the guidelines to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> with the suggestion that their issuance be
                            accompanied by a statement that the Department concurs in the guidelines
                            and urges full cooperation from all Mission personnel overseas.</p>
                        <p>Since annual shifts in correspondent assignments begin early in July, I
                            believe it would be helpful to have the guidelines issued, with
                            Department support, by mid-June.</p>

                        attention of important publics throughout the world on disarmament issues.
                        As we move beyond <gloss target="#t_SSOD_1">SSOD</gloss>, it is desirable to
                        foster a more informed and rational climate of opinion in other countries
                        within which future official deliberations can take place. I am, therefore,
                        establishing under the Special Coordination Committee an interagency
                        committee to develop a year-long program in public diplomacy addressing the
                        several issues of arms control and disarmament.<note n="4" xml:id="d134fn4"

                    </p>
                    <p>Our goals are:</p>
                    <p>—to stimulate serious and constructive international discussion of important
                        arms control and disarmament issues;</p>
                    <pb n="390" facs="0439" xml:id="pg_390"/>
                    <p>—to involve a wider spectrum of thoughtful and interested foreign individuals
                        and institutions in a discussion involving clear statements of the U.S.
                        positions and policies;</p>
                    <p>—to help develop a broader based consensus in other countries in support of
                        U.S. positions; but at a minimum, to bring more serious and realistic public
                        deliberations to bear on the several issues;</p>
                    <p>—to diminish the ability of the Soviet Union and others to command public
                        attention in foreign countries on the basis of emotional rhetoric.</p>
                    <p>Among other means for achieving these goals, the committee should
                        consider:</p>
                    <p>—regional seminars and conferences bringing together leading intellectuals
                        for realistic discussions of arms control and disarmament issues;</p>
                    <p>—visits to the U.S. by foreign journalists and scholars to discuss arms
                        control and disarmament issues with American counterparts;</p>
                    <p>—programs aimed at diffusing the results of these discussions to wider
                        audiences abroad;</p>
                    <p>—intensified research designed to provide U.S. policymakers with a clearer
                        understanding of the views of important foreign publics.</p>
                    <p>You should designate an appropriate member of this interagency committee with
                        a rank equivalent to and not lower than that of Deputy Assistant Secretary.
                        The committee will be chaired by the International Communication
                            Agency.<note n="5" xml:id="d134fn5">An unknown hand underlined

                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s Foreign Correspondents.</p>
                    <p>1. Foreign correspondents of the Voice of America stand at the important and
                        highly visible juncture of journalism and diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>2. While <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> journalists are government
                        employees, subject to all the laws and regulations which apply to the
                        conduct of everyone in the federal service, they are required at the same
                        time to perform with a high degree of journalistic professionalism and
                        integrity. The work and status of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        overseas correspondents are identical to those of correspondents for other
                        American press and broadcasting organizations except as specifically noted
                        in this telegram.</p>
                    <p>3. The primary task of the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> foreign
                        correspondent, in fulfillment of the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        Charter’s requirement that Voice of America news be accurate, objective,
                        comprehensive, and consistently authoritative, is to give depth and
                        perspective to the broadcast news file. Bearing in mind the special
                        interests of audiences around the world, the correspondent transmits
                        actualities, eyewitness reports, backgrounders, interviews and advisories
                        designed to assist the foreign listener in understanding the news.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> correspondents are not investigative
                        reporters. They broadcast the news; they do not present their opinions nor
                        do they editorialize in their reporting.</p>
                    <p>5. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> correspondents are supervised
                        directly by the Chief of the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> News
                        Division in Washington and receive assignments exclusively from the Voice of
                        America. All material submitted by correspondents is reviewed by <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Washington before usage to ensure that it
                        meets <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> charter standards.</p>
                    <p>6. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> correspondents will travel with
                        regular fee (not official or diplomatic) passports; they will enter a
                        country with journalist visas; they will register and be accredited as
                        journalists; they will be subject to local laws and regulations applicable
                        to foreign journalists; they will <pb n="392" facs="0441" xml:id="pg_392"
                        />not have access to classified information; they will use post exchange or
                        commissary facilities on the same basis as non-government American
                        journalists are permitted to use these facilities; and they will not depend
                        on U.S. Embassies or <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> posts for offices
                        or residential space, secretarial services or other administrative
                        support.</p>
                    <p>7. They will use commercial, not <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        communications channels. (Embassy communications will be available only in
                        cases were emergency conditions cause the establishment of “press pool”
                        services available to other American journalists.) U.S. Embassies will be
                        neither more nor less helpful to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        correspondents than to other American journalists in giving or facilitating
                        interviews, supplying information, aiding in travel. Making other
                        arrangements, assisting with any difficulties.</p>
                    <p>8. Since the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is an official broadcasting
                        service, it cannot, as a practical matter, divorce itself in the minds of
                        many of its listeners from an identification with the U.S. Government.
                        Therefore, a <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> correspondent will not
                        seek an interview with a head of state or other politically prominent or
                        controversial personality, either in or out of government, without the prior
                        approval of the News Division in Washington, if the News Division agrees to
                        the interview, the correspondent will inform the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1"
                            >PAO</gloss> or the Mission of the assignment as much in advance as
                        possible. In the event that the Chief of Mission objects to the assignment,
                        the correspondent will refer the matter to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> Washington for resolution.</p>
                    <p>9. The same steps, i.e., prior approval from <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> Washington and prior notification of the <gloss
                            target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> or Mission, will be followed in covering
                        any story which can reasonably be deemed sensitive.</p>
                    <p>10. Similarly, should a story require travel in a war zone or other dangerous
                        area, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> correspondents will consult in
                        advance with <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Washington and will keep
                        the Embassy informed of their plans.</p>
                    <p>11. The <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> correspondent has a general
                        obligation to inform the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> of his or her
                        presence in the country, and of the general nature of his or her
                        assignment(s). But <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> will not supervise
                        the work of a <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> correspondent, and the
                        correspondent was no obligation to clear copy with anyone before
                        transmitting it to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Washington.
                        Missions, therefore, bear no responsibility for the content of material
                        broadcast by the Voice of America.</p>
                    <p>12. If requested by the Chief of Mission, the correspondent will promptly
                        provide a copy of the story after it has been filed.</p>
                    <p>13. Any comments, criticism or questions from the Chief of Mission regarding
                        correspondent activities or copy should be directed to Washington through
                        Department channels with an information copy to <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>14. The above guidelines are intended to define and clarify the status and
                        responsibilities of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> correspondents
                        working abroad. <pb n="393" facs="0442" xml:id="pg_393"/>This telegram,

                        the administrative arrangements (e.g., office space and housing), and
                        solving specific questions they relate to each correspondent and each
                        locality, will inevitably take additional time. All such arrangements,
                        however, should be effective by October 1, 1978.</p>

                    <p>The attached decision memo has for this year served as the framework for this
                        institution’s approach to the arts. From several fragmentary comments I have
                        heard, it is not wholly acceptable to <gloss target="#t_ECA_1">ECA</gloss>
                        for reasons that are not wholly clear to me but which I believe have been
                        communicated to persons outside of the Agency.</p>
                    <p>At the last full-scale meeting of the Interagency Art Group, held at Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJ_1">Mondale</persName>’s house, I set forth
                        essentially the contents of the attached decision memo. In response to a
                        question, I suggested that $10,000,000 was a good, round figure to pay for
                        the overseas deployment of the products identified, developed and otherwise
                        funded through the Endowments’ domestic infrastructure and that the money be
                        placed in the Endowments’ budget as a separate line item.</p>
                    <p>The seminal attitudes that should be considered in following on that meeting
                        are the following:</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_NEA_2">NEA</gloss>, at a meeting with the
                        Director—“The arts offer the greatest international impact for the least
                        investment. The creation of the International Exhibitions Committee was the
                        only real mistake in my tenure as chairman.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MJ_1">Mondale</persName>—“It is important that
                        these activities be controlled by the creative personnel, in the case of the
                        arts by the artist, rather than by administrators, bureaucrats or
                        impresarios. I will lobby to get you the $10,000,000.”</p>
                    <p>The only way I know to make a collegial, non-redundant relationship work is
                        to have our international infrastructure list the art and humanities people
                        and products called for by our communication and cultural relations needs.
                        The Endowments would then focus their domestic infrastructure on filling
                        those needs in terms of both quality and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MJ_1"
                            >Mondale</persName>’s strongly held views. There may be other ways,
                        better ways, that are not known to me. If so, the possessors of such ideas
                        should come forward with them. What is not acceptable in my view is
                        continuing in the same old comfortable way which adds up to an infinitesimal
                        product in terms of the present and potential need.</p>

                            will be the launching pad for this Administration’s international arts
                            posture and policy.</p>
                        <p>It has been in gestation for close to half a year. The initiative came
                            from the efforts of some in the arts community and within the government
                            to have the government assume total responsibility for up-front, blank
                            check funding of U.S. participation in the international <pb n="395"
                                facs="0444" xml:id="pg_395"/>arts festivals such as Venice, Sao
                            Paulo, Paris, etc.<note n="4" xml:id="d136fn4">References are to the
                                Venice Biennale, Sao Paulo Bienal, and Biennale de Paris.</note>
                            This proposal would delegate the entire mission to the International
                            Exhibitions Committee, an offshoot of American Federation of Arts. The
                            Committee has been almost entirely funded by grants from the National
                            Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities
                            (more than $150,000, all of which goes for staffing and honoraria and
                            travel expenses for the members—none for program). The Committee’s
                            non-government fund raising efforts have brought in about $20,000 in two
                            years.</p>
                        <p>Others believe that the international arts festivals represent an
                            insignificant part of the need and opportunity to engage art and artists
                            in the field of international cultural relations. The leaders of the two
                            Endowments are strongly international minded and anxious to operate with
                            high visibility in that sphere. From the interagency meeting I attended,
                            it was clear that <persName corresp="#p_HPB_1">Paul Henze</persName> was
                            favorably inclined and said that the Endowments should take their lead
                            from <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> in this matter.</p>
                        <p>It would seem that a logical and effective division of effort is entirely
                            possible. It could lead to a prompt and dramatic two-way flow of art and
                            artists which would overwhelm the present puny efforts (<gloss
                                target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s cultural presentations to six
                            countries in Eastern Europe, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s
                            facilitation of two or three major U.S. museum shows per year, <gloss

                            exhibits in circulation, our joint funding of a few international arts
                            festivals). The Endowments have the will and the funds. They have a
                            domestic infrastructure; we have an international infrastructure.
                            Linking them collegially would equal mutual self-interest (some say the
                            funds now going to overhead support of the International Exhibitions
                            Committee would be obviated by using the Endowments peer panels for that
                            purpose and that those funds would more than cover the cost of
                            participation in the festivals).</p>

                    <p>At the meeting we agreed that a major overall purpose of this public
                        diplomacy effort will be to inject greater realism into the international
                        discussion of arms control and disarmament issues. Following are some of the
                        themes that were proposed for special emphasis. Assuming that the summary
                        adequately reflects our discussion, I find it to be less satisfying than it
                        sounded at the time. Several questions: (1) Are these truly the ideas on
                        which we wish to have international consensus? If not, what’s missing? (2)
                        What role should we give issues raised in the <gloss target="#t_SSOD_1"
                            >SSOD</gloss> Program of Action<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">The Final
                            Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, June 30,
                            1978 (S–10/2) contains the <gloss target="#t_SSOD_1">SSOD</gloss>

                        How would we open and sustain productive discussion on any given issue with
                        any given group?</p>
                    <p>1. Arms control and national defense are two sides of the same coin, because
                        both aim at reducing the threat of war by maintaining the security balance.
                        We of course prefer to see the balance maintained at lower, less costly
                        levels, and look to arms control as the major path to that end. Although
                        some countries, particularly among the non-aligned, may not be impressed
                        with the argument that a strong U.S. defense is essential for world peace,
                        we should not be hesitant to make the point at appropriate times, or to be
                        defensive about our necessary force modernization measures.</p>
                    <p>2. A good arms control agreement is one which contributes to stability. It
                        should maintain, and hopefully improve, military stability in the sense that
                        in a crisis neither party would be tempted to initiate—or threaten—a first
                        strike. Likewise, it should enhance stability in the dynamics of the arms
                        competition by ensuring that growth in arsenals stays within agreed limits.
                        We should also emphasize that U.S. opposition to nuclear proliferation is
                        based primarily on its destabilizing <pb n="397" facs="0446" xml:id="pg_397"
                        />effects, and less on an assessment that it would be directly harmful to
                        narrow U.S. interests.</p>
                    <p>3. In international arms control negotiations the U.S. seeks agreements that
                        are equitable to all sides, and are readily perceived as such. Agreements
                        which go against the interests of signatory nations will obviously not be
                        viable over the long run.</p>
                    <p>4. Any arms control agreement must be adequately verifiable, so that the
                        participating nations can have confidence that the terms of the agreement
                        are being followed.</p>
                    <p>5. The successful completion of arms control agreements, particularly between
                        the superpowers, forms an important part of the improvement in overall
                        political relations. The converse is even more true: the failure of such
                        negotiations is likely to have an additive detrimental effect.</p>
                    <p>6. Arms control is not a spectator sport. All nations should contribute to
                        efforts to reduce tensions in areas where they are important actors.
                        Conventional arms transfers and nuclear nonproliferation are two issues
                        where the positive participation of other countries is essential to reaching
                        viable solutions which meet legitimate security or energy concerns but are
                        not destabilizing. In both instances we should be prepared to counter
                        charges by supplier countries that the U.S. is infringing on their markets
                        and by recipient countries that the U.S. is trying to perpetuate what they
                        consider their second-class status.</p>
                    <p>At the meeting the following action assignments were agreed upon:</p>
                    <p>1. All members will review this paper and bring their comments to the next
                        meeting. They will also offer suggestions on: countries to which priority
                        should be given, possible governmental and non-governmental program
                        participants, and seminal literature on the major arms control and
                        disarmament issues.</p>

                        about, arms control/disarmament issues by concerned publics in host country.
                        In preparing reply <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> should consult with
                        other members of Mission. Insofar as possible, given host country political

                        arms control/disarmament issues. These publics defined as individuals and
                        institutions professionally involved with such subjects who influence
                        government policy or public opinion, whether inside or outside the

                        areas. Given numbers of individuals, names of organizations, and any other
                        basic information you believe would be useful.</p>
                    <p>5. Second section should describe in one or two paragraphs main arms
                        control/disarmament issues of interest to these publics.</p>

                    <p>6. Third section should indicate degree of interest these publics have in
                        specific topics. This section discusses interest only, not perceived
                        importance of issues, or availability of possible remedies. For each topic
                        select most appropriate term from following list: very high, high, medium,

                    <p>G. The Soviet Union is militarily superior to the United States.</p>
                    <p>H. The U.S. is likely to sacrifice the interests of its friends and allies as
                        it pushes for a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement.</p>
                    <p>I. Completion of a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement is of
                        great importance for all countries.</p>
                    <p>J. Completion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is of great importance for

                    <p>L. U.S. policies on conventional arms transfers are well-intentioned and
                        constructive.</p>
                    <p>M. U.S. policies on nuclear nonproliferation are well-intentioned and
                        constructive.</p>
                    <p>N. Regional agreements to limit conventional arms transfers are an
                        impractical objective.</p>
                    <p>O. The host country should exercise greater restraint in international sales
                        or purchases of conventional arms.</p>
                    <p>P. Arms suppliers should not transfer arms to countries guilty of gross and

                        Union on arms restraint in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                    <p>T. Nuclear weapons free zones can contribute importantly to world peace.</p>

                    <p>U. U.S. policies on nuclear nonproliferation stem primarily from its desire
                        to retain its dominant position in the nuclear fuel market.</p>
                    <p>V. The host country should exercise greater caution in developing plutonium
                        or nuclear reprocessing capabilities.</p>
                    <p>W. The host country should take a more active role in international arms
                        control and disarmament discussions.</p>
                    <p>X. There are significant unexploited opportunities for regional arms control
                        in the region of host country.</p>
                    <p>Y. The current disarmament machinery (e.g., U.N. bodies, <gloss
                            target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss>) needs radical restructuring.</p>
                    <p>8. Fifth section should contain summary of results of any recent systematic
                        in-country opinion surveys on these subjects, and any additional information
                        post feels would be useful to Washington planners.</p>
                    <p>9. Sixth section should briefly indicate way you went about completing your
                        response and your assessment of overall reliability of information
                        provided.</p>

                        would involve both official and unofficial Americans and foreigners.
                        Participants from several countries could meet for two or three days to
                        cover either a broad range of arms control questions or selected specific
                        issues (e.g., <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, conventional arms
                        transfers, nonproliferation). The conference might be cosponsored by a
                        prestigious local institution in the country where it is staged; that
                        organization could also be given a grant to publish the proceedings.
                        Activities in the period before the sessions could include: exchange grants
                        to the U.S. for key participants, distribution of suitable background
                        literature, media placement, and discussions with Mission officers.
                        Post-conference activities might include: distribution of the proceedings,
                        small-group seminars in the home countries of the participants, <gloss

                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Special exchange projects</hi>. A group of arms control
                        specialists (perhaps all of them journalists, or academics, or “think tank”
                        researchers) might be brought to the U.S. for a “multi-regional project”

                        arms control specialists, travel to military installations or commercial
                        facilities, and a week-long seminar sponsored by an appropriate American
                        institution. <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> media would give coverage
                        to these activities. After their return, posts would maintain close contact
                        with the participants and involve them in seminars and other programs.</p>

                        resident in the U.S. and could focus on single-country or single-region
                        concerns. Coverage generated could tie in directly with seminars and

                        organizations abroad, support to exchanges, subsidizing of conferences, and
                        publication and distribution of materials.</p>

                        attitudes regarding specific issues currently under negotiation. Media
                        reaction reporting could help serve the same purpose, as well as convey any
                        press comment emanating from our conferences or other activities.</p>

                        to support dialogue in a number of other formats. For example:</p>

                    <p>A range of issues in international communications and cultural policy will be
                        increasingly prominent over the next months. In particular, a potentially
                        volatile <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> meeting scheduled for
                        October and November bears careful monitoring by the White House.</p>
                    <p>As you know, there has been no comprehensive coordination by the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> of communications policy and cultural
                        affairs in the international <pb n="405" facs="0454" xml:id="pg_405"/>arena.
                        I would like to undertake, on a short-term basis, a review of these issues
                        so that you might suggest more effective ways for the President to provide
                        guidance to the bureaucracy. These matters are nominally handled by State
                        and <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>, although the <gloss
                            target="#t_FCC_1">FCC</gloss>, Commerce, the Cultural Endowments, and
                        others have rapidly expanding involvement. Several Congressional committees
                        have interests and concerns.</p>
                    <p>Briefly, here are the three main substantive areas:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The role of the United States in communicating</hi> its
                        culture, ideas, and policy to others. <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>
                        is beginning its newly mandated approach to “public diplomacy,” a result of
                        last year’s reorganization. Frequently, Presidential policy could be more
                        effectively implemented if there were a closer relationship between the
                        White House and <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>. Questions of policy
                        arise and guidance would be helpful and appreciated.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The appetite of other countries</hi> for bringing their
                        culture and policy to our people. Increasingly, other governments (and their
                        non-governmental institutions, including scholars, journalists, artists,
                        cultural leaders, etc.) want to beam cultural and political product and
                        policy toward our people. What should be our reaction? And what might be the
                        role of the government in the decision-making process of our private
                        sector?</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Conflict among the West, the Marxists, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s about the free flow of ideas and
                            information</hi>. The Marxists and many one-party developing states have
                        posed a considerable challenge to our approach to the free flow of
                        information and culture. They want to mandate “state” responsibility for
                        communications and ideas that are transmitted from within a nation. Our
                        institutions are seriously concerned and are looking to the government for
                        help and direction. A major fight over these problems will emerge at the
                        previously mentioned late fall meeting of <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1"
                            >UNESCO</gloss>, for which our government is currently unprepared.
                        Obviously, at the heart of all this conflict is the question of human
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>My main interest, on your behalf, would be to determine how international
                        communications and cultural matters can be better intertwined with the main
                        thrust of our foreign policy. <persName corresp="#p_PJLJ_1">Jody
                            Powell</persName> strongly supports this proposal and I would expect
                        that the President would have no objection if the idea had your
                        recommendation.</p>
                    <p>May we explore this idea further at your earliest convenience?</p>

                        while monitoring the attempt of the Soviet Union (and some Third World
                        governments) to force <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> to mandate
                        “state” control of media.</p>
                    <p>Previously, I had suggested:</p>

                        new mandate.</p>
                    <p>2. More foreign culture and communication is being aimed at our citizens.</p>
                    <p>3. Conflict is intensifying among the West, the Marxists, and the <gloss
                            target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s about the free flow of ideas and
                        information. Apart from the international human rights issues in the daily
                        headlines, <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss>’s general assembly
                        meeting this fall<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">See <ref target="#d129fn6"
                                >footnote 6, Document 129</ref>.</note> will be a battleground over
                        the issue of “state” control of communication and ideas that are transmitted
                        beyond national borders.</p>
                    <p>I propose to define areas where guidance for <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> could result in more effective implementation of
                        Presidential foreign policy initiatives. In an effort to move deeply and
                        immediately into the broad area of communication and culture (and to develop
                        a clearer understanding of the bureaucratic dynamics), I would plan to
                        initially focus on the “state control” issue (#3 above). This approach
                        should not conflict with <persName corresp="#p_RH_1">Henry

                    <p>In short, here is my proposed job description for the next eight months:
                        Liaison with <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">John Reinhardt</persName>, and
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff member pursuing the human

                    <pb n="407" facs="0456" xml:id="pg_407"/>
                    <p>Assuming you agree with the previous paragraph as a rough job description,

                            >ICA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In early October, I would attend the annual four-day meeting of the
                        International Institute of Communications, where Western and non-aligned
                        (and some Marxist) broadcasters come together. Last year, I gave the
                        welcoming address to this group on behalf of the President when they met in
                        Washington. This organization is extremely concerned about the free flow of
                        information (they see the issue in human rights terms) and appreciates the
                        United States for “listening” to the non-aligned nations, while treating
                        them each in a unique way.</p>
                    <p>In late October and November, the <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss>
                        general assembly will meet in Paris. I should attend some of those sessions
                        concerned with the “state control” issue and with other international
                        communications and cultural affairs questions.</p>
                    <p>During the remainder of this year, I will have been working closely with
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>, State, and the Cultural
                        Endowments, as appropriate, to marshal their forces for the forward movement
                        of our foreign policy. By early 1979, a plan of future action will have been
                        developed.</p>
                    <p>My assignment, as a short-term staff member (Special Advisor to the <gloss

                        cultural affairs??) would end April 1, 1979, six months after I have come
                        onto the payroll—which is within the time allowable for these temporary
                        arrangements.</p>

                    <p>This memo is in response to your request that I develop more fully my
                        thoughts about <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>. I followed your

                        next months. I think the focus of my review will result from answers to some
                        of the following:</p>
                    <p>1. What is the internal hierarchical structure of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> and how are executive policy decisions implemented?</p>
                    <p>2. What are the external influences on <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>
                        decision-making (and policy implementation)—including both governmental and
                        non-governmental sources?</p>
                    <p>3. What are the channels of communication between <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> and the White House? Between <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> and State? Are these sufficient and appropriate for all
                        concerned?</p>
                    <p>4. What has been the experience of <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff
                        members with <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>? What conclusion can be
                        drawn that might lead to more fruitful relationships?</p>
                    <p>5. How can the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> better tap <gloss

                    <p>8. Is there a useful way for <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> to

                        <salute>Dear John:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I keep hearing that <hi rend="italic">Problems of Communism</hi> is losing
                        staff, that it is falling behind in publication schedules and that there is
                        now consideration of reducing it from a bimonthly to a quarterly. This
                        publication represents a unique form of collaboration between the private
                        academic <pb n="410" facs="0459" xml:id="pg_410"/>research community and the
                        U.S. Government—something which your agency in its new incarnation is
                        intended to encourage. Communist governments and movements all around the
                        world are facing more, and more serious, problems than ever before. It is in
                        our interest to encourage debate and discussion of these problems everywhere
                        in the world, but especially in Communist-dominated countries and within
                        Communist groups elsewhere. There is no better vehicle for doing this than
                            <hi rend="italic">Problems of Communism</hi>. It would be a bargain if
                        it cost several times its current budget. It should continue to appear as a
                        bimonthly and it should have the support it requires to be as lively and
                        topical as its staff can make it. If you are encountering difficulty in
                        providing needed support for this valuable publication on which I would be
                        able to help, please let me know. I want to feel assured that it is not only
                        going to continue its present level of excellence and timeliness, but
                        becomes even better.</p>

                        in such issues, seem to number no more than 100 persons per country. In
                        three of the four African countries included in this survey, posts believe
                        that fewer than 20 persons constitute this public. Similarly small numbers
                        are believed to be professionally involved or particularly concerned with
                        these issues in the two Arab countries and in two of the four Latin American

                    <p>In general, those with influence over policy or opinion concerning arms
                        control/disarmament issues are most likely to be found in the country’s
                        cabinet, in special elements of the foreign and defense ministries, in
                        specialized government or private research institutes, on the political
                        science, law and international relations faculties of major universities, in
                        enterprises dealing with the production of energy or with the sale or
                        purchase of arms, and in the press. Nearly every <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >USICA</gloss> post can name the concerned elements of the government,
                        the relevant research centers, and the particular scholars, editors and
                        columnists who work on arms control/disarmament issues.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these narrowly-defined influential publics, there exist in
                        many countries larger publics deeply interested in some aspects of arms
                        control/disarmament policies but with relatively little influence over them.
                        While in Europe these larger publics may be concerned with <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1"
                            >MBFR</gloss>, in most other countries their interest is more parochial.
                        Of greatest concern are the issues believed to affect directly the country’s
                        security and the balance of power within its region. These larger publics
                        include environmentalists worried about the dangers of nuclear power
                        production, the storage of nuclear waste or the fallout from nuclear
                        testing; nationalists resentful of their country’s depend<pb n="413"
                            facs="0462" xml:id="pg_413"/>ence on foreign sources for nuclear fuel
                        and subservience to foreign controls; those fearful that arms control
                        agreements or human rights concerns might prevent their country from
                        purchasing the arms needed for defense; and those concerned that controls
                        will curtail their arms sales and thereby create unemployment and
                        unfavorable trade balances. It also includes the many ordinary citizens
                        genuinely concerned about the dangers of nuclear, or conventional, war.
                        These larger publics may run into the thousands or—as in Japan, Germany and
                        the U.K.—even millions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Interest in Arms Control/Disarmament Issues</p>
                    <p>Interest in various arms control/disarmament issues differed considerably by
                        region. It was strongly affected by the country’s perceived security needs
                        and by present or anticipated requirements for nuclear energy. Both in
                        Europe and elsewhere, however, interest is high in nuclear non-proliferation
                        and regional arms control, low in radiological and chemical weapons,
                        antisatellite systems and the linkage between disarmament and development.
                        Conventional arms transfers, in Europe of high interest primarily to the
                        major arms exporters, is of great interest to most non-European countries
                        because they want to purchase the arms they feel they must have or deny them
                        to potential enemies.</p>
                    <p>The concerned European publics generally oppose nuclear proliferation out of
                        genuine fear that the spread of nuclear weapons will increase the danger of
                        nuclear holocaust. Yet they want assured supplies of nuclear fuels with
                        minimal restrictions, and in some cases the right to unhampered export of
                        nuclear technology. Non-European publics, although for the most part
                        officially committed to nuclear non-proliferation, want to retain their
                        country’s option of joining the nuclear club, or at least of purchasing
                        fissionable materials for the production of energy without burdensome
                        foreign controls.</p>
                    <p>Interest in regional arms control arrangements is generally limited to the
                        country’s immediate region: to <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> in

                            Protocol II called upon states possessing nuclear weapons that agree to

                        attributable to the view that weaker countries cannot influence the

                        their outcome. Interest in a comprehensive test ban treaty, on the other
                        hand, is quite low in Europe, very high in Japan and high in several other

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Opinions About U.S. Policies and U.S. Strength</p>
                    <p>Concerned publics in most countries appear to agree that the United States
                        “is genuinely interested in achieving meaningful arms control and
                        disarmament.” Even Romania and Yugoslavia, who identify with the nonaligned
                        countries and generally see eye-to-eye on disarmament issues, grant that the
                        U.S. really wants arms reductions. While concerned publics in other East
                        European countries and the Soviet Union as well as Italy are divided on the
                        question of American sincerity, those in India, South Africa and Tanzania
                        and the general public in Japan doubt that America really means what it says
                        about arms control.</p>
                    <p>On two subjects of great interest to specialists in most
                        countries—conventional arms transfers and nuclear non-proliferation—opinion
                        about U.S. policies is divided. Probably reflecting America’s role as <pb
                            n="415" facs="0464" xml:id="pg_415"/>the largest arms supplier,
                        concerned publics in a majority of the 30 surveyed countries seem to
                        disagree with the contention that American policies in this area are well
                        intentioned and constructive. <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> members
                        Italy and France along with such U.S. friends as Egypt, and Israel, Iran,
                        Japan and S. Korea share with the Soviet Union and East European countries a
                        jaundiced view of U.S. arms sales policy. And on non-proliferation, German
                        publics join the French, Soviets, and East Europeans, among others, in
                        disagreeing that “U.S. policies on nuclear non-proliferation are well
                        intentioned and constructive.” In fact, concerned publics in many
                        countries—including Germany, Italy, France and Sweden as well as the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and its satellites—tend to agree with
                        the cynical view that U.S. policies on nuclear non-proliferation “stem
                        primarily from its desire to retain its dominant position in the nuclear
                        fuel market.” On <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> negotiations, on the
                        other hand, which for most non-European countries have low salience, publics
                        with an identifiable opinion on the subject (except in Hungary, Poland and
                        the Soviet Union) generally attribute a constructive role to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>In a majority of the survey countries, the concerned publics are believed to
                        agree, at least with reservation, that the United States is militarily
                        superior to the Soviet Union. Even in the Soviet Union, its Warsaw Pact
                        allies and in Yugoslavia they are believed to see the U.S. as the stronger
                        country, although public opinion in Western Europe tends to view the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as militarily equal to or ahead of the
                        United States. In about half the countries—including India, Japan, Mexico
                        and, not surprisingly, the Soviet Union, Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia—the
                        United States is viewed as having more armaments than necessary to meet its
                        legitimate defense needs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Opinions About Soviet Policies</p>
                    <p>Concerned publics in most countries other than the Soviet Union, Eastern
                        Europe, Great Britain and Australia do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> perceive
                        the Soviet Union as being genuinely interested in achieving meaningful arms
                        control and disarmament. Further, except in the Soviet Union and Eastern
                        Europe, these publics are thought to agree that the Soviet Union has more
                        arms than it needs. Several countries in addition to the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and its satellites credit the Soviet
                        Union with a constructive approach to the <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1"
                            >MBFR</gloss> negotiations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Opinion About Host Country Policies</p>
                    <p>In almost none of the 30 countries do concerned publics feel that their own
                        country has more armaments than are necessary to meet legitimate defense
                        needs. The exceptions are Germany, Britain and Italy, where opinions on this
                        question is thought to be divided. And only a few West European countries
                        agree that their country “should <pb n="416" facs="0465" xml:id="pg_416"
                        />exercise greater restraint in international sales or purchase of
                        conventional arms.” The notion that one’s own country “should exercise
                        greater caution in developing plutonium or nuclear reprocessing
                        capabilities” is also rejected in a majority of these countries. On the
                        other hand, there is high agreement that one’s country should take an
                        active, or more active, role in international arms control and disarmament
                        discussions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Opinions on Various Arms Control/Disarmament
                        Issues</p>
                    <p>Several of the very important questions raised in this section turned out to
                        be “motherhood” issues. Thus, there is near-universal agreement—even in
                        countries with low interest in these issues—that nuclear-weapons free zones
                        can contribute importantly to world peace, that completion of the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement and of the comprehensive
                        test ban treaty are of great importance for all countries and that the
                        United States should continue to pursue an agreement with the Soviet Union
                        on arms restraints in the Indian Ocean. At the same time, specialist publics
                        in a number of important Western-oriented countries appear to agree that the
                        U.S. “is likely to sacrifice the interests of its friends and allies as it
                        pushes for a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement.” And, in
                        most non-European countries, these publics seem to have been swayed by the
                        Soviet campaign against the “neutron” bomb, although in Western Europe only
                        Norway and Sweden agree that <gloss target="#t_ERW_1">ERW</gloss> should be
                        prohibited.</p>
                    <p>Opinion on regional agreements to limit conventional arms transfers is
                        divided. Several Western allies join the Soviet Union and East European
                        countries in disagreeing that such arrangements are impractical. In about
                        the same group of countries, concerned publics believe that significant
                        unexploited opportunities for regional arms control exist in their
                        region.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is a great divergence of opinion among concerned publics about
                        the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration’s
                        initiative in linking arms exports to human rights violations. Despite
                        strong West European approval of American human rights initiatives on the
                        part of the general public, the specialized <gloss target="#t_ACD_1"
                            >AC&amp;D</gloss> publics in France, Great Britain and Italy are
                        believed to agree with the Soviet Union, East European countries and others
                        that arms suppliers should be at liberty to transfer arms to countries
                        “guilty of gross and consistent violations of basic human rights.”</p>

                    <p>Judging by reports from our posts in key countries, the most salient issues
                        among European attentive publics are <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>,
                        non-proliferation/nuclear energy, <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>,

                        Europe, the only salient topics are <gloss target="#t_CAT_1">CAT</gloss>,
                        regional arms control (e.g., Ayacucho), and non-proliferation/nuclear
                        energy. Attentive publics everywhere are reported to be supportive of <gloss

                            >SALT</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, and <gloss

                        issues, relatively few foreign publics seem to support greater restraint on

                    </list>
                    <p>In the wake of our recent discussion, and after a careful review of the
                        relevant memoranda on the subject, I have reached the following conclusions
                        with regard to the broadcasting of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        Commentaries:</p>
                    <p>1. In partial fulfillment of the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Charter
                        mandate to “present the policies of the United States clearly and
                        effectively,” <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> should begin broadcasting
                        policy Commentaries as soon as this is operationally feasible.</p>
                    <p>2. Commentaries are to be concise presentations of <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss> policies on issues of major concern and importance to the
                        United States and to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> listeners, the
                        purpose of which is to give listeners as clear and accurate an understanding
                        of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policies as is possible through
                        international radio broadcasting.</p>
                    <p>3. The production and airing of Commentaries will be handled in the following
                        manner:</p>
                    <p>a. Though written by various persons in the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> Current Affairs Division, Commentaries will be introduced
                        on the air by a phrase such as “Here is a <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> Commentary read by (<hi rend="italic">name of
                        reader</hi>),” or “The following is a <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        Commentary,” with no mention of the author.</p>
                    <p>b. The individual reading a <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Commentary
                        on the air in English and on most of the other major language services will
                        not be heard in any other broadcast capacity; in those few broadcast
                        services where limited staff size will not permit such an absolute
                        separation of functions, Commentary readers will not be heard at any other
                        point in the <pb n="420" facs="0469" xml:id="pg_420"/>same broadcast (e.g.,
                        as a newscaster, a master of ceremonies, a feature narrator, etc.).</p>
                    <p>c. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s Current Affairs Division will issue
                        a minimum of three Commentaries weekly to be broadcast by the various
                        language services, more if required and if relevant materials are
                        available.</p>
                    <p>d. The present relationship between <gloss target="#t_PGMG_1">PGM/G</gloss>
                        and the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Policy Application Staff (as
                        outlined in my memorandum of May 4, 1977) remains unchanged for the
                        production of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Commentaries; <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> will continue to look to <gloss
                            target="#t_PGMG_1">PGM/G</gloss> (and, through that office, to the
                        Department of State and other policy-making elements of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>) for advice and guidance on subject matter
                        for <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Commentaries and on special aspects
                        of a particular policy which should be emphasized and/or caveats which
                        should be observed; there should be regular post-broadcast critiques of
                        Commentaries, and, while prior script clearance is not required, it should
                        be sought when thought advisable by <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                        >VOA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. The broadcasting of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Commentaries in
                        no way affects <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s Charter obligations to
                        present the news in an “accurate, objective and comprehensive” manner, to
                        “present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American
                        thought and institutions,” and to “present responsible discussion and
                        opinion” on U.S. policies. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Commentaries
                        should complement, not supplant, these other Charter responsibilities. At
                        the same time, the advent of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        Commentaries should not lead to a decline in appropriate news reporting and
                        analysis of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policies. I assume that
                        official <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy statements and actions
                        will continue to be reflected appropriately in the full range of <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> news broadcasts, news analyses, features
                        programs, etc.</p>
                    <p>5. Finally, I assume that you will want to develop a suitable method for
                        evaluating the nature and effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> Commentaries over a specified period of time.</p>
                    <p>I shall be delighted to discuss any questions you may have about these
                        conclusions.</p>

                    <p>We believe realistic objectives of the initiative are:</p>
                    <p>1. To lend clarity and precision to the foreign understanding of specific
                        U.S. policies and broad purposes.</p>
                    <p>2. To increase the capacity of foreign individuals and institutions to engage
                        in thoughtful, unemotional analysis of basic arms control issues.</p>
                    <p>3. To help create an international climate of opinion on these issues which
                        is more congenial to the U.S. point of view.</p>
                    <p>The Committee considered a full range of arms control questions. However, to
                        give greater focus to issues most important to U.S. interests and salient to
                        publics abroad, and recognizing our resource limitations, we propose that
                        preponderant attention be given to the following:</p>
                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and the East-West balance</p>
                    <p>2. Nonproliferation and the Comprehensive Test Ban (<gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                            >CTB</gloss>)</p>
                    <pb n="422" facs="0471" xml:id="pg_422"/>
                    <p>3. Conventional arms transfers (<gloss target="#t_CAT_1">CAT</gloss>) and
                        regional arms control arrangements.</p>
                    <p>Specific programmatic goals will vary according to the immediacy and
                        character of the issues involved in particular areas. The Committee devoted
                        considerable time to discussing the relative attention that should be given
                        to questions of obvious priority in the short run, such as <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and (to a somewhat lesser extent)
                            <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, as compared with longer term
                        issues such as <gloss target="#t_CAT_1">CAT</gloss> and some aspects of
                            nonproliferation.<note n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">The JCS representative on
                            the Committee advocated a cautious approach to initiatives regarding
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                                >CTB</gloss> due to the sensitivity and dynamics of the
                            negotiations, and further recommended full interagency discussion of
                            these issues prior to embarking on any related programmatic activity.
                            Additionally, he considers other arms control and disarmament issues to
                            be of no less importance than <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, and as such they should
                            receive equal priority for the short run as well as the longer term.
                            [Footnote is in the original.]</note> We agreed that considerable
                        resources should be devoted during the next six to twelve months to making a
                        strong presentation of U.S. policy on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                        >SALT</gloss>, particularly to audiences in Western Europe and U.S.-based
                        European correspondents. Simultaneously, we would expect to inaugurate
                        various program activities supporting <gloss target="#t_CAT_1">CAT</gloss>,
                        nonproliferation, and <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, concentrating on
                        areas other than Europe, but including that region as well.</p>
                    <p>Our goals will also be affected by the degree to which U.S. policies have
                        been firmly settled or are still evolving. Where U.S. policies are well
                        established, we must assure that they are understood abroad, if necessary
                        through activities that are essentially consciousness raising exercises, and
                        report back on areas of disagreement or misunderstanding. Where U.S.
                        positions are in a formative stage (e.g., with respect to certain regional
                        arms control proposals), this initiative can be useful for consensus
                        building and providing early feedback on foreign opinions for the guidance
                        of policy makers.</p>

                        <hi rend="roman">III.</hi> The Foreign Environment:</p>
                    <p>For this report <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> solicited Washington and
                        field assessments of arms control-related attitudes of informed publics in
                        30 countries representing all major regions and various levels of
                        development. Some of the more significant findings from this admittedly
                        rough and second-hand survey are summarized below.</p>
                    <p>Within the larger publics concerned with foreign policy, national security,
                        and energy, there exists in all the countries surveyed a much smaller group
                        of knowledgeable individuals who influence government policy or public
                        opinion on arms control and disarmament issues. Their numbers range from
                        fewer than 100 in many of the developing <pb n="423" facs="0472"
                            xml:id="pg_423"/>countries to several hundred in India and some of the
                        industrialized democracies.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these narrowly-defined groups of influentials, larger publics
                        in many of the countries have an interest in one or more aspects of arms
                        control, though they exercise relatively little influence over public
                        policy. Of greatest concern to these publics are specific issues believed to
                        affect directly the country’s security, such as <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> and Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions (<gloss
                            target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>) in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Though interest in particular issues differs considerably by region, nearly
                        everywhere it is thought to be high on nonproliferation and regional arms
                        control arrangements, but low on radiological and chemical weapons,
                        antisatellite systems, and the linkage between disarmament and
                        development.</p>
                    <p>The concerned European publics generally oppose nuclear proliferation out of
                        genuine fear that the spread of nuclear weapons will increase the danger of
                        nuclear holocaust. Yet they want assured supplies of nuclear fuels without
                        undue restrictions, as well as the right to export nuclear technology when
                        it does not significantly increase the probability of proliferation.
                        Although nominally committed to nuclear nonproliferation, many non-European
                        publics wish to retain their countries’ option of joining the nuclear club,
                        or at least of purchasing fissile materials for the production of energy
                        without burdensome foreign controls.</p>
                    <p>Interest in regional arms control arrangements is generally limited to the
                        country’s immediate region: to <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> in
                        Europe, to Ayacucho and Tlatelolco in Latin America, to the Indian Ocean in
                        the littoral states.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and III are of great interest to
                        most European countries, both East and West, but of medium interest in most
                        other countries, with a few exceptions such as Japan. Interest in a
                        comprehensive test ban treaty, on the other hand, is judged to be quite low
                        in Europe, but high elsewhere (e.g., Japan, India).</p>
                    <p>Theater nuclear or “grey area” issues, which in major European countries are
                        followed closely, are apparently of low salience in most non-European
                        countries (Japan, Australia, South Korea, and Pakistan excepted). Among
                        other issues of relatively high interest are the enhanced radiation warhead
                            (<gloss target="#t_ERW_1">ERW</gloss>) and nuclear-free zones.</p>
                    <p>Finally, several countries—notably Egypt, Israel, South Korea, South
                        Africa—are so preoccupied with their immediate problems that their publics
                        show little interest in issues unrelated to these questions.</p>
                    <p>The concerned publics in most countries are judged to agree with the general
                        proposition that the United States “is genuinely interested in achieving
                        meaningful arms control and disarmament,” though in some (e.g., India, South
                        Africa, and Tanzania) there is more outspoken skepticism that America really
                        means what it says about arms control.</p>
                    <pb n="424" facs="0473" xml:id="pg_424"/>
                    <p>On two subjects of great interest to specialists in the 30 countries
                        investigated—conventional arms transfers and nonproliferation—opinion about
                        U.S. policies is divided, but tends to be critical. Probably reflecting
                        either skepticism because of America’s role as the largest arms supplier, or
                        dissatisfaction with U.S. decisions affecting them, concerned publics in
                        most countries (ranging from <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and East
                        Asian allies such as France, Italy, Japan, and South Korea, to Warsaw Pact
                        members, and including most of the non-aligned in between) are thought to
                        disagree with American policies in these areas. The climate of opinion
                        regarding nonproliferation is similarly inhospitable, with such countries as
                        France, West Germany, India, Pakistan, Japan, South Korea, Yugoslavia, and
                        the Soviet Union, among others, disagreeing that U.S. policies on this
                        subject are “well intentioned and constructive.” In fact, concerned publics
                        in many countries representing all regions are believed to accept the view
                        that U.S. policies on nuclear nonproliferation “stem primarily from its
                        desire to retain its dominant position in the nuclear fuel market.”</p>
                    <p>In a majority of the surveyed countries, the concerned publics are believed
                        to agree, but not without some reservations, that the United States is
                        militarily superior to the Soviet Union. Even the Soviet Union, its Warsaw
                        Pact allies, and Yugoslavia see the U.S. as the stronger country, although
                        directly measured public opinion in Western Europe tends to view the
                        U.S.S.R. as militarily equal to or ahead of the United States. In about half
                        the countries the United States is viewed as having more armaments than
                        necessary to meet its legitimate defense needs. At the same time, concerned
                        publics in about a third of the non-Communist countries are thought to agree
                        with the statement that the U.S. “is likely to sacrifice the interests of
                        its friends and allies as it pushes for a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II agreement.”</p>
                    <p>Outside of the Soviet bloc, concerned publics in most countries do <hi
                            rend="italic">not</hi> perceive the Soviet Union as being genuinely
                        interested in achieving meaningful arms control and disarmament. Further,
                        except in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, these publics are thought to
                        agree that the Soviet Union has more arms than it needs. However, several
                        countries in addition to the U.S.S.R. and its satellites credit the Soviet
                        Union (as well as the U.S.) with a constructive approach to the <gloss
                            target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> negotiations.</p>
                    <p>There is near-universal agreement—even in countries with low interest in
                        these issues—that nuclear-weapons free zones can contribute importantly to
                        world peace, that completion of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        II agreement and of the comprehensive test ban treaty are of great
                        importance for all countries, and that the United States should continue to
                        pursue an agreement with the Soviet Union on arms restraints in the Indian
                        Ocean. There is also believed to be strong opposition to the <gloss
                            target="#t_ERW_1">ERW</gloss> in many countries, both in and outside of
                        Europe.</p>
                    <pb n="425" facs="0474" xml:id="pg_425"/>
                    <p>Several Western and non-aligned nations, as well as the Soviet Union and the
                        East European countries surveyed, believe that regional arrangements may be
                        a practical, though as yet not fully exploited, way of limiting conventional
                        arms transfers.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is considerable divergence of opinion among concerned publics
                        about linking arms exports to human rights violations. Despite strong
                        approval of American human rights initiatives on the part of the general
                        public in Western Europe, the specialized publics in France, Great Britain,
                        and Italy are believed to agree with the Soviet Union, East European
                        countries, and others that arms suppliers should not be constrained from
                        making transfers to countries that are “guilty of gross and consistent
                        violations of basic human rights.”</p>

                        considerable effect, many believe (though some sources contacted by the

                    <p>In propagandizing extensively on disarmament, the U.S.S.R. has sought
                        primarily to build support among certain less developed countries (<gloss

                        and its European allies. Without being defensive, our efforts must to a
                        degree be directed toward setting the record straight on what we have
                        already done in the arms control field and on the rationale for U.S. weapons
                        modernization programs. At the same time, we will not assume that U.S. and
                        Soviet broad security interests are universally incompatible.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Audiences:</hi> Our activities should be directed toward
                        building constructive communication between Americans and influential
                        publics abroad, in and outside of government, who significantly influence
                        either the decision-making process or public opinion. While some of these
                        may be “disarmament specialists,” others may approach arms control questions
                        primarily from the perspective of national security policy.</p>
                    <p>We propose placing emphasis on countries for which the issues have high
                        salience or which carry particular weight in international deliberations on
                        these questions. The priorities listed in Section V reflect the Committee’s
                        best judgment at this time, but are not meant to exclude other significant
                        regional actors and will be reviewed in the light of increased information

                    <p>The role of the People’s Republic of China is somewhat anomalous. While the

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Basic messages:</hi> To counteract the widespread tendency
                        toward simplistic and unrealistic approaches to arms control (as evidenced
                        most recently by foreign nongovernmental organizations at the <gloss
                            target="#t_SSOD_1">SSOD</gloss>), we propose to emphasize two broad
                        points:</p>
                    <p>1. Arms control is a matter of the head as well as of the heart. It is not
                        enough simply to feel strongly about the arms race, and to deplore the
                        danger, expense, and other burdens brought about by modern weapons. Rather,
                        rational defense policy and arms control are two sides of the same coin,
                        because both aim at reducing the threat of war by maintaining the security
                        balance. Arms control issues cannot be resolved without tremendous patience
                        as well as careful study of the technological, security, and institutional
                        problems involved. (Some of the more down-to-earth American <gloss
                            target="#t_NGO_1">NGOs</gloss> can be helpful in making <pb n="427"
                            facs="0476" xml:id="pg_427"/>this point, and may provide a useful means
                        by which to help upgrade the analytical capabilities of other nations.)</p>
                    <p>2. Lack of openness, or “transparency,” is a fundamental impediment to arms
                        control. Without more widely shared, reliable information about other
                        nations’ armaments, national leaders and private specialists on security
                        questions quite naturally make conservative—perhaps unnecessarily
                        conservative—assessments of their defense requirements and are forced to
                        rely on national technical means for the verification of arms control
                        agreements. Openness in defense planning is already a characteristic of
                        Western nations, and it is in our interests, as well as in the interests of
                        effective arms control, that the pressures of international opinion on this
                        issue be brought to bear on more secretive nations such as the Soviet
                        Union.</p>

                        interest over the next year or two. While Western positions on this issue

                        Atlantic Alliance and its political significance to the detente process.</p>
                    <p>With our allies in Europe and Asia we should reiterate our view that
                        strategic stability is the foundation stone of world peace. The U.S. has the
                        strength and will to maintain the balance at whatever level necessary, but
                        hopes that through arms control agreements, such as <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, the balance can be held at lower, less
                        costly, and less dangerous levels. Any agreement affecting the strategic
                        balance must meet certain basic criteria: it must maintain, and if possible
                        improve, the military security of the U.S. and its allies; it must be
                        equitable, and readily perceived as such; and it must be adequately
                        verifiable.</p>
                    <p>With audiences in the <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDCs</gloss>, our approach
                        should be more general and more educative. We should emphasize that U.S.
                        arms control efforts in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and other
                        forums are achieving progress in the control of strategic armaments, and
                        that these negotiations bring positive benefits to all nations without
                        eroding the East-West balance upon which world peace depends. We should also
                        stress that although the U.S. ultimately seeks substantial reductions in
                        nuclear arsenals, the most immediate—and most difficult—goal is to stop or
                        slow the increase in weapons. Once limits on expansion are reached, a
                        foundation for significant mutual reductions will have been achieved.

                        also usefully be approached within the context of its possible contributions
                        to nonproliferation. Universal adherence to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> or equivalent internationally-binding agreements would also
                        be a major step toward the same end.</p>
                    <p>Two dates of special interest are: (1) November 1979, the conclusion of

                        the renegotiation period called for by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act. As
                        the latter date approaches, there will be a growing interest in unresolved
                        contentious questions, particularly in India, Western Europe, and other
                        areas, if it is impossible to renegotiate all agreements for cooperation by
                        then. <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> should receive ongoing treatment
                        as the outline of a treaty becomes clear, with special attention when an
                        agreement is reached between the U.S., the U.K., and the U.S.S.R., when it
                        is sent to the Committee on Disarmament and the U.N. General Assembly, and
                        when it is under consideration by the Senate. If it is signed before the
                        1979 non-aligned summit, <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> could be on
                        the agenda there.</p>
                    <p>The major focus of activities on this subject should be to put across the
                        point that nonproliferation is in the interest of all states, both nuclear
                        and non-nuclear. Collectively we must focus on the long-term changes in the
                        global ecosystem, and look seriously at where mankind is, or should be,
                        heading in the coming decades.</p>
                    <p>In encouraging a more analytical approach to nonproliferation issues, we
                        should stress (particularly to non-signatories of the <gloss

                        and the potential proliferation harm of premature movement to a
                        plutonium-based fuel economy. Further nuclear proliferation could well upset
                        existing regional stabilities, and would ultimately impair the national
                        security of all nations both within the affected region and elsewhere in the
                        world. We should articulate the U.S. view that in the coming few years
                        priority should be given to developing proliferation-resistant and
                        economically feasible fuel cycles. U.S. caution on this score is based on
                        prudence and on the interests of the global community as reflected in the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> and the International Atomic Energy
                        Agency, not on a desire to maintain discriminatory hegemony or dominance of
                        the nuclear fuel market.</p>
                    <p>Recognizing that U.S. policies in this area are frequently criticized as
                        insensitive, hypocritical, and paternalistic, it is essential that we <pb

                        our efforts to encourage sales restraint by supplier countries not be seen
                        as a cartel strategy. We anticipate that the most responsive audiences to
                        this subject, especially in the developed countries, are likely to be
                        non-governmental groups, including some in the environmental field.</p>

                        global consideration of this question is still so new that the contemplated

                        regional arms control arrangements arrived at by the parties most directly
                        concerned. These agreements offer the best hope for building intra-regional

                        for arms influxes. Latin America and Africa may be among the promising areas

                    <p>A typical country receiving priority might be, for example, an upper tier
                            <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss> that is: (1) hoping to
                        significantly increase its purchases of conventional arms to offset weapons
                        buildups in neighboring countries; (2) marginally interested in East-West
                        negotiations, which it views as essentially aimed at preserving superpower
                        hegemony over the Third World; and (3) anxious not to foreclose its nuclear
                        options by adhering to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> or otherwise
                        accepting fullscope safeguards. In this typical country arms control
                        decisions are made by a coterie of government officials, linked to an
                        equally small number of private specialists in the universities, the print
                        media, and a few research institutions. Public opinion is generally
                        uninformed on the details of the issues, while <gloss target="#t_NGO_1"
                            >NGOs</gloss> which concern themselves with these questions are either
                        Soviet-influenced mass organizations on the fringes of the political systems
                        or are comprised of “defense intellectuals” who view arms control through a
                        narrowly defined national security prism.</p>
                    <p>Our primary objective in this situation might be to involve knowledgeable
                        individuals in and out of the government and opposite numbers in the U.S. to
                        (1) exchange ideas and information, (2) clear up misapprehensions among
                        those close to the decision-making process about where the U.S. stands on
                        the issues, and (3) improve that country’s analytical capabilities.</p>
                    <p>On issues of regional significance to the country and its neighbors, such as
                            <gloss target="#t_CAT_1">CAT</gloss> and nonproliferation, the main
                        approach might be to expose the specialists to the views of U.S. official
                        and non-official experts as well as to the attitudes of others in the region
                        (who perhaps see the country’s interest in increased arms and nuclear
                        capabilities as not necessarily benign). Illustratively, the following
                        techniques might be used to achieve this aim: (1) exchange grants for
                        specialists from several countries in the region to visit the U.S. as a
                        group for discussions with U.S. officials and American specialists, ending
                        in a series of structured meetings held under the auspices of a foreign
                        policy organization; (2) a regional conference, cosponsored by a prestigious
                        foreign policy institution of the country, to informally discuss alternative
                        approaches to limiting arms influxes; (3) a grant to an American <gloss
                            target="#t_NGO_1">NGO</gloss> to work with specialists from the region
                        to explore prospects for a regional <pb n="432" facs="0481" xml:id="pg_432"
                        />clearing house to share information on arms control subjects; (4) speaking
                        tours to the region for leading U.S. experts on these subjects; (5)
                        fellowships for one or two nationals of the country to study arms control at
                        a U.S. academic center for a year.</p>
                    <p>To allay misperceptions about the U.S. strategic military and arms control
                        posture two main techniques could be used: (1) development of
                        indigenous-language media materials which discuss the significance of <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> for East-West stability and its role in
                        furthering global arms control objectives, and (2) exchange activities which
                        bring defense specialists, journalists, and researchers to the U.S. to see
                        at first hand how arms control and security interrelate in U.S. policy.</p>
                    <p>Instead of directly treating current policy disagreements over
                        nonproliferation, a group of official and unofficial American specialists on
                        this subject might meet with local counterparts in a three-day
                        off-the-record session to discuss the implications of alternative
                        proliferation scenarios over the coming decades.</p>
                    <p>For all of these activities <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> research and
                        media reaction reporting would keep U.S. policy makers and program
                        participants informed of local attitudes on the questions under discussion.
                        At the same time <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> media (e.g., Voice of
                        America programming, videotape recordings, magazines, presentation books,
                        bibliographies) could be used effectively to supplement the interpersonal
                        dialogue.</p>

                    <p>In a typical developed country the issues might revolve around the U.S.
                        reliability as an ally (in which <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> is
                        feared by some as presaging a decoupling of American and regional defense),
                        and a perception that the U.S. is attempting to retain its dominant position
                        in both the conventional arms and nuclear markets. Governmental decisions
                        and public pronouncements are affected by a sizable concerned public,
                        affiliated with a wide variety of academic, research, and political
                        institutions. Some anti-nuclear <gloss target="#t_NGO_1">NGOs</gloss> have
                        political clout and support certain American arms control official
                        positions, though they tend to oppose the U.S. military presence in the
                        region. Writers on security questions are the most vocal and articulate
                        opponents of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement, as
                        well as other proposed regional arms control arrangements.</p>
                    <p>The major program strategy here might be to present the rationale for U.S.
                        defense and arms control efforts through indigenous institutions which are
                        already set up to explore these issues, and thus maximize the credibility of
                        our presentations. Through participation in seminars and placement of
                        articles in local publications we would seek an impact on both decision
                        makers and public opinion. Although government officials would not be
                        ignored, journalists, <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> commentators, <pb
                            n="433" facs="0482" xml:id="pg_433"/>defense specialists in parliament,
                        and faculty members of international relations institutes might receive
                        primary attention.</p>
                    <p>To get at the question of U.S. reliability and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss>, we might use the following techniques: (1) information
                        packets on the U.S. strategic posture and arms control, with special
                        emphasis on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>; (2) special briefings on
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> for foreign journalists resident
                        in Washington and New York; (3) tours of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> facilities for parliamentarians and journalists from the
                        country; (4) a high-visibility joint seminar on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> and regional security held in conjunction with a major
                        strategic studies think tank; (5) speaking tours for authoritative U.S.
                        experts on these subjects; and (6) a U.S. visitation program in which
                        specialists meet with U.S. officials and private arms control/security
                        experts, travel to appropriate installations around the country, and
                        participate in a wrap-up conference in Washington which focuses on arms
                        control in the context of East-West security issues.</p>
                    <p>Suspicions about U.S. positions on <gloss target="#t_CAT_1">CAT</gloss> and
                        nonproliferation might suggest an approach wherein we both explain U.S.
                        policies and also stress the importance of sharing ideas and information as
                        we collectively attempt to develop appropriate policies for the coming
                        decade. This low key approach might envisage such goals as: (1) to encourage
                        systematic research by local institutions on public attitudes on these arms
                        control questions, (2) to stage a series of small seminars off of <gloss

                        discussed, (3) to develop a computerized arms control information base for
                        sharing with experts in the country, (4) to publish and distribute a
                        quarterly arms control “portfolio” containing copies of major policy
                        statements and journal articles, and (5) to subsidize travel and
                        participation by specialists from the country in arms control related
                        seminars conducted by private organizations in the United States.</p>

                    <p>One element in this program should be systematic and periodic surveys by

                        on central issues of arms control, disarmament, and national security.
                        Although soundings of mass opinion may be useful on certain broad topics,

                        questioning should be possible. Evidence from such surveys of mass and elite
                        opinion could be integrated with media reporting to provide current profiles

                        <salute>Dear <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>As dog days slowly fade from the Washington scene, and as our newly created
                        Agency settles in following reorganization, I begin herewith a series of
                        letters (of my own composition, for better or worse) designed to share
                        directly with you and your staff what I have attempted to share with your
                        colleagues here in Washington: that is, my views with respect to those
                        concepts and philosophy which will guide our operations.</p>
                    <p>I have an uneasy feeling that the letters—this one in particular—are each
                        likely to be a trifle long; I therefore urge you not even to take them up
                        until you have an uninterrupted period to concentrate and reflect upon each
                        of them, yourself, before making them the subject of discussion with your
                        staff where that seems appropriate.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the series, I want to address such subjects as audience
                        identification, the related distribution and records system, the “new”
                        personnel system, mutuality, libraries, English teaching, genuine outreach
                        programs and several other questions with which we have wrestled over the
                        years. The subjects themselves are not new, but over the years they have
                        never coalesced to form operational touchstones. We have always had “good”
                        activities, but precise shibboleths of professionalism have tended to elude
                        us. I seek in this series to provide some bench marks for the Agency.</p>
                    <p>Discussions of most of these subjects have taken place in Washington (and
                        with respect to some subjects, the discussions have been unduly protracted).
                        Draft statements of policy have been prepared, and some tentative views have
                        been conveyed to you. In a number of instances I personally have kept
                        proposed policy statements from coming to you because I have not been
                        entirely satisfied that our thinking—or our language—has been sufficiently
                        refined. Now I believe we are ready to communicate effectively with you; I
                        intend that within a relatively short time you will know where we stand on
                        each of the above subjects.</p>
                    <pb n="435" facs="0484" xml:id="pg_435"/>
                    <p>In this first letter, I want to address the question of field operations,
                        generally and philosophically.</p>
                    <p>From the beginning I have said—and have meant—that roughly 80% of this
                        Agency’s work should stand or fall on the basis of what happens in the
                        field. Service in Washington should be regarded only as an apprenticeship
                        leading to greater service in the field. We in Washington have an obligation
                        not to erect complicated systems which become their own justification and
                        which do not contribute to smooth, efficient and effective work at posts
                        abroad. Over the years, for example, I have thought that we have made the
                        Country Plan process, or audience records systems, so complex that we have
                        forced attention on systems rather than on effective communication.
                        Conceptual and operational simplicity must govern our instructions to you. I
                        hope we can meet our own standard.</p>
                    <p>I want to acknowledge at the outset that much of what follows and will follow
                        in succeeding letters is not new. Much of it will already animate your
                        leadership and work. Much of it you will already have heard in various
                        communications from Washington, including my own statements. It is my simple
                        intent to summarize for ready reference as we begin the first full year of
                        our work together. So I hope you will accept this series of letters in that
                        spirit, amending course where amendment is directed by the thoughts in this
                        and following letters.</p>
                    <p>To begin at the beginning: the bedrock purpose of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> is to deal with what Walter Lippmann once called the
                        “pictures in peoples heads.”<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> is referring,
                            presumably, to Walter Lipmann’s 1922 work <hi rend="italic">Public
                                Opinion</hi>. Lipmann’s first chapter is entitled “The World Outside
                            and The Pictures in Our Heads.”</note> There is a tendency in a society
                        as pragmatic as our own to deprecate the importance of the pictures in
                        peoples heads. My own view is that it is important—fundamentally
                        important—and sobering work, to be approached with tenacity and humility. I
                        have quoted Oliver Wendall Holmes and H.G. Wells before. I accept, and hope
                        that all of us accept, as literal truth the assertion that “man’s mind,
                        stretched to a new idea, never goes back to its original dimension.” I
                        accept as literal truth that “human history is in essence a history of
                        ideas.” I continue to agree with President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName>’s assertion at Notre Dame that “it is a mistake to
                        undervalue the power of words and of the ideas that words embody.”<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">See <ref target="#d57fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                57</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Against that philosophical background, how do we give operational expression
                        to the idea that ideas are important?</p>
                    <p>A <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> arrives in Germany or in Rwanda,
                        encounters an advanced communications network or a comparatively simple one,
                        inherits more <pb n="436" facs="0485" xml:id="pg_436"/>or less complicated
                        bilateral problems and opportunities, engages an extensive and informed
                        audience or one considerably less so. In either case, and in all cases in
                        between, what should the Agency reasonably expect of its principal
                        representative in the field? How do we translate Holmes and Wells and
                        President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> into effective
                        operation?</p>
                    <p>In rather short order, we should expect from the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1"
                            >PAO</gloss> a thoughtful rationale for communicating in a single
                        distinctive country, a rationale which will withstand challenge by
                        Ambassadors, by the American public and its representatives, or by Agency
                        management.</p>
                    <p>This rationale should bear some relationship to <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss> goals and objectives in the country. It can be expressed in
                        terms of the tensions—the explicit <hi rend="italic">or</hi> implicit
                        communications tensions—between the host society and the United States.
                        These tensions can be revealed by disdain for American cultural and
                        aesthetic values; by ignorance of our efforts to erect a humane, libertarian
                        society; by outright opposition to our nuclear non-proliferation policies;
                        or in other, sometimes hidden, ways. The truly important problems and
                        opportunities may not be easy to identify; they may shift from time to time
                        (but not from day to day); they may exceed both our reach and our grasp—some
                        so much so that they should simply be set aside, others so slightly that we
                        should work at their resolution even though that resolution may never be
                        fully accomplished.</p>
                    <p>Where problems or opportunities are not likely to be effectively addressed by
                        anything <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> can do, where we can only
                        nibble at the edges but not do anything to relieve a problem—a trade
                        imbalance, for example—we (you) should boldly state that fact, make it a
                        part of the rationale. You will have no opposition from us.</p>
                    <p>The corollary thought, however, is that if you can reduce no tensions,
                        contribute to the advancement of no <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        objectives—and one must allow for this possibility theoretically—then it is
                        your obligation and ours to shift resources to environments more amenable to
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> approaches.</p>
                    <p>Articulating one’s rationale, we should acknowledge, ought to involve at
                        least some intellectual agony. We are not looking for warmed-over political
                        reporting. And, indeed, I must extend a general compliment on the quality of
                        the bilateral communications essays this past spring. Whatever the defects
                        of the Country Plan instructions, the resulting documents were measurably
                        more thoughtful, profound and subtle than many of their predecessors.</p>
                    <p>The second general step in field operations, of course, is to identify those
                        in the host society whom one wishes to engage. We will have in your hands
                        within the next few weeks a revised and simplified set of guidelines for
                        audience analysis. <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> at posts where the
                        earlier version was field-tested appear to have found the structured
                        approach to <pb n="437" facs="0486" xml:id="pg_437"/>be of considerable
                        assistance. I have personally delayed the sending of these guidelines as I
                        have demanded greater simplicity. I will return to the question of “who” in
                        a subsequent letter transmitting the guidelines. For the purposes of this
                        letter, and as a general proposition, I do want to note my personal belief
                        that our principal interlocutors should be those individuals and
                        institutions in a society who create, communicate, debate ideas. For better
                        or worse, it is the intellectuals—broadly defined—who set the agenda in
                        virtually every society. Our purpose should be to stimulate their thought,
                        refresh it where we can, understand the “pictures in their heads” and be
                        certain that they understand our own. It is the “agenda setters” whom we are
                        after. I must indicate one caveat: when we discuss libraries later, I shall
                        indicate that the doors should be ajar for those who are not normally
                        considered “agenda setters.”<note n="4" xml:id="d150fn4">See <ref
                                target="#d154">Document 154</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In most societies, questions of access, time and limitations on our own
                        resources will force hard choices upon us: we cannot hope to communicate
                        effectively with all of the “agenda setters” on all of the issues we would
                        like. Choice is forced upon us; the quality of our choices determines our
                        effectiveness. Intellectual agony presents itself, again.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the heart of this letter: our concept of communication.</p>
                    <p>I believe it is essential to draw a distinction between “programming” and
                        effective communication. The very word “program” has been much abused in the
                        CU/USIS/ICA lexicon, and we paid a certain price.</p>
                    <p>Neither <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> nor <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss> was ever acknowledged as full partners in diplomacy, nor in
                        some cases even as important contributors to national goals. One effect of
                        our perceived lack of relevance in the past has been at least a mild case of
                        institutional self-doubt. It is simply human nature in such circumstances to
                        justify one’s existence by being active. My observations of the past year
                        suggest that we may be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> active: too many
                        activities, too many programs, too many reports designed for voracious
                        Washington machines and, most importantly, perhaps too many objectives—and
                        too little time for reflection.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe that activities or “programs” necessarily sum to
                        communication. From our perspective here in Washington we will not be
                        insisting on quantity: a few well-chosen people in the audience, a few
                        well-chosen opportunities for the exchange of ideas among important “agenda
                        setters,” a few discernible changes in the pictures in people’s heads should
                        be our goals. More than that we can probably not accomplish.</p>
                    <pb n="438" facs="0487" xml:id="pg_438"/>
                    <p>I am sensitive to the demands levied upon you by your working environment,
                        and particularly by your mission colleagues. Some—perhaps most, but
                        certainly not all—of those demands are inescapable and simply constitute the
                        familiar cost of doing business. We make proper allowance for this cost. I
                        am, rather, addressing myself to those activities and objectives which are
                        generated within the <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> post.</p>
                    <p>I also acknowledge the dilemma faced by many posts at which the environment
                        offers almost inexhaustible communication opportunities. We must regret
                        forgoing some in order to focus our minds and efforts on a few. The choice
                        cannot be easy. <hi rend="italic">But I, for one, would vastly prefer a few
                            demonstrable accomplishments in the realm of ideas than a plethora of
                            merely good activities and programs</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, I am troubled by the verb “to program.” In many instances, it seems
                        to me, effective and stylish “programming” has come to substitute for—and
                        possibly to get in the way of—effective communication.</p>
                    <p>A program is an event; communication is a process. Effective communication
                        entails the establishment of connections, their sustenance over time, the
                        refreshing of intellectual wells, repetition for effect, the articulation
                        and focussing of post resources for mutual reinforcement. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The outcome—without which all else is delusion—should be a detectable
                            increase in the intellectual or social momentum on any chosen subject as
                            a result of our activities</hi>. It would, I submit, be worth asking
                        yourselves how many of your post’s activities are in fact contributing to an
                        increase in such momentum or whether your post is spread too thinly for <hi
                            rend="italic">effective</hi> accomplishment of the truly important.</p>
                    <p>To risk a generalization: it strikes me that it is at large posts in
                        environments characterized by numerous policy and other communications
                        tensions, and at small posts with restricted resources and relatively heavy
                        extraneous demands on time, that the potential conflict between
                        “programming” and effective communication is likely to be most acute; in the
                        former case because the opportunity to do good work is so great across such
                        a wide spectrum; in the latter case because it is the constant human
                        temptation to respond to environmental demands—and to stay busy. In both
                        cases, the challenge is to knit specific program events together to form a
                        seamless web so that the <gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> grant, the
                        lecture, the <gloss target="#t_VTR_1">VTR</gloss> showing, the <gloss
                            target="#t_WirelessFile_1">Wireless File</gloss> distribution, the
                        outreach article passed to the Minister of State—in short, the
                        “program”—become a coherent process of communication on a few important
                        subjects over an extended period of time. The specific “programs” or
                        “events” are links which form a chain and the connector is the <gloss
                            target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> and his staff.</p>
                    <p>The fact that audiences enjoy a “program,” ask for additional similar
                        “programs,” and express admiration for the person or country producing such
                        “programs” should not deflect us from our underlying <pb n="439" facs="0488"
                            xml:id="pg_439"/>purposes. Such emotional bonuses from our audiences may
                        be desirable but should not be equated with communicating. We are not
                        impresarios—although thorough knowledge of stagecraft is important in our
                        business. We are communicators.</p>
                    <p>Let me be more specific. At the Brussels <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>
                            Conference,<note n="5" xml:id="d150fn5">See <ref target="#d125fn6"
                                >footnote 6, Document 125</ref>.</note> I listened with fascination
                        as a <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> described how over a period of
                        years rising journalists in his country had had little or no contact with
                        the United States. Many of these men and women were assuming prominent
                        positions in prominent media. The <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> was
                        not certain why these men and women lacked an American connection, nor did
                        he seek to assign blame. He did describe the manner in which he handled the
                        problem, which incidentally seemed eminently satisfactory to me.</p>
                    <p>My point in this is that it is a prime example of a problem which <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> can attack—but not by way of a “program.”
                        Our first thought, one which would occur to the most junior of us, is to
                        arrange <gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> grants—and we probably should.
                        But the grant is a single link. What are the other links, other “programs”?
                        How do we employ other post resources, including staff and time, in this
                        important communication nexus? Indeed, should we drop less important
                        “programs,” though fully described in the Country Plan, as we concentrate
                        our forces to close this gap?</p>
                    <p>And, finally, have we built in some way of evaluating results—the
                        “momentum”—as we begin the protracted communication process with such a
                        group? In short, are we managing “programs” or a communication process?</p>
                    <p>A final note, which may strike you as much as it has me: at current budget
                        levels, total expenditures at posts average close to $1,000 per working day
                        per American. However one caveats the figure, it remains—or ought to
                        remain—a sobering statistic. The obligations of individual and collective
                        accomplishment which flow from it—day in, day out and to the taxpayer—are
                        substantial. Important subjects, institutions and individuals must be
                        addressed thoughtfully and importantly. The bottom-line question remains:
                        are we making a detectable difference in the momentum of at least a few
                        ideas?</p>
                    <p>There is far more left unsaid herein than said. You have every justification,
                        indeed, for asking what else is new; the answer, frankly, is that my purpose
                        was to summarize for reference and, where circumstances suggest, to try to
                        provoke new ways of looking at old business. Still, in terms of concepts,
                        philosophy—choose your own guiding word—the Agency expects no more and no
                        less of its principal field representatives than that they have a rationale,
                        a thoughtfully identified <pb n="440" facs="0489" xml:id="pg_440"/>audience,
                        a sense of communicating (as opposed to “programming”) and that they make a
                        detectable difference. We have had too much theology, much of it esoteric,
                        from Washington over the years. My intent in this letter has been simply to
                        codify common sense, recognizing that it is one of our longest suits at
                        field posts in particular.</p>
                    <p>I look forward to discussing this and other subjects of interest with those
                        of you who will be at the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> Conference in

                    <p>1. The purpose of this message is to elicit quickly your first views on the
                        manner in which public diplomacy—broadly defined—can help develop support in
                        the Middle East for the significant, tangible results <pb n="441"
                            facs="0490" xml:id="pg_441"/>of the Camp David summit.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d151fn2">September 5–17. The President, Sadat, and Begin
                            returned to Washington September 17 to sign the two Camp David
                            agreements entitled “A Framework for Peace in the Middle East Agreed at
                            Camp David” and “Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty Between
                            Egypt and Israel.” For the text of the agreements, see <hi rend="italic"
                                >Public Papers: Carter, 1978</hi>, Book II, pp. 1523–1528.</note>
                        Specifically, we feel we are not successfully communicating with the Arabs
                        the importance of seizing the opportunity offered by the Camp David
                        Agreements. The highest levels of the administration have made it clear to
                        us that the task of winning support is of the utmost importance. We are
                        developing a plan of action here and want to incorporate your suggestions at
                        the outset.</p>
                    <p>2. We assume: (a) that the sense of central vision and purpose of the Camp
                        David Framework will be difficult to maintain, at least in public mind, as
                        negotiations unfold; (b) that news media will tend to highlight divisions
                        and negative issues, thereby contributing to erosion of momentum; (c) that
                        moderate individuals, institutions and governments will require continuing
                        encouragement.</p>
                    <p>3. We also assume, given the extraordinary importance of the summit, that
                        within very broad limits <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> and State will
                        be able to draw on private individuals and institutions within the United
                        States, including at least limited foundation resources, for speaking,
                        seminar, conference, personal contact and encouragement purposes.
                        Furthermore, we think that at least some institutions and individuals in
                        Western Europe and elsewhere will be willing to assist where third-party or
                        neutral-ground activities seem desirable. We have had indications from our
                        allies (and a specific offer from the U.K.) that could result in
                        participation by friendly news media (the <gloss target="#t_BBC_1"
                            >BBC</gloss> for example) in our support effort.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> resources are, of course, available
                        as required.</p>
                    <p>5. With above assumptions in mind, we need your recommendations on:</p>
                    <p>(a) The manner in which we can, directly or indirectly, enhance the number
                        and potency of host-country individuals and institutions supporting summit
                        results;</p>
                    <p>(b) The possibilities over the next several months for enhancing useful
                        contacts between Arabs and Israelis. Such contacts need not be in the
                        context of direct peace negotiations. It seems to us that many private
                        American (and European) institutions are planning, or could be interested in
                        planning, conferences and seminars on a variety of “safe” topics (economics,
                        public administration, technical management) to which appropriate Israelis
                        and Arabs could be jointly attracted;</p>
                    <pb n="442" facs="0491" xml:id="pg_442"/>
                    <p>(c) The manner in which private American individuals and institutions, and
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> resources as well, might be used to
                        encourage moderate individuals and institutions in Middle East;</p>
                    <p>(d) What non-U.S. resources, public or private, could usefully be
                        engaged.</p>
                    <p>6. We need your views as soon as possible. We realize this is a tight
                        deadline but we would be greatly assisted if you could reply by your <gloss

                        here.</p>
                    <p>2. The enlarged scope for <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>-funded
                        activities is real and important to the future of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> relations and to
                        perceptions of each other. While no one can say how long the present
                        policies will last, no one doubts the commitment of the present leadership
                        to building a modern state primarily through self-reliance but with
                        substantial foreign technical help. Whether it is possible to send students
                        to foreign countries, encourage the study of foreign languages in China,
                        increase informa<pb n="443" facs="0492" xml:id="pg_443"/>tion input from
                        outside sources, encourage listening to foreign broadcasts and do many of
                        the other extraordinary things the current leadership has started doing
                        without seriously affecting the non-technical aspects of Chinese society is
                        a question only a Chinese fortune teller can predict. But the Chinese appear
                        to be determined to go down this road, and until the line changes—which it
                        can do although at considerable cost—we have an opportunity to enhance the
                        communication process to a significant degree.</p>
                    <p>3. We have the start of a highly useful <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>
                        program thanks to the excellent work done by a number of State Department
                        officers who labored in the vineyard when conditions were less than ideal.
                        John Thomson’s efforts since arriving a few months ago have been applauded
                        by all of his colleagues, and he has been able to build quickly on the
                        foundation established earlier. The major components in the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> funded effort here are: exchanges of all
                        types; providing English teaching materials to foreign experts and in all
                        likelihood soon to Chinese teachers; a currently active film and <gloss
                            target="#t_VTR_1">VTR</gloss> loan program now primarily with foreign
                        teachers of the Chinese but with great potential for direct loans to
                        Chinese; a book translation program which can be substantially expanded to
                        take advantage of the current passion for foreign literature; the start of a
                        small exhibit program whose efficacy will be tested before the end of the
                        year. Publication program making available specialized printed materials
                        about the U.S. including materials on <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                        education; the start of a library which can be shaped to support our
                        exchange programs; distributing <gloss target="#t_WirelessFile_1">Wireless
                            File</gloss> and other policy materials to Foreign Ministry
                        officials.</p>
                    <p>4. It would be foolhardy for us to attempt to rush in now with programs
                        beyond those enumerated above until we get a clearer indication of the
                        permanency of the situation here and particularly our own ability to carry
                        out current programs with an adequate measure of success. But to do even
                        these minimal tasks requires considerably more in <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss> resources than currently assigned to the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. In manpower alone we cannot cope with
                        these minimal requirements; in spite of the herculean efforts of an
                        exceptionally able officer plus the considerable help of others in the
                        Mission. In addition, the special organizational arrangement at the Mission
                        obviously reflects a previous set of circumstances which are badly
                        outdated.</p>
                    <p>5. To carry out these tasks I suggest the following:</p>
                    <p>A. The establishment of an <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> office within
                            <gloss target="#t_USLO_1">USLO</gloss>—either as the cultural and press
                        section or as <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>-Peking, whichever is most
                        acceptable to <gloss target="#t_USLO_1">USLO</gloss> and the Department. The
                        head of this office would report to the <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>
                        and Ambassador and would have responsibility for carrying out the programs
                        listed in para 3 above and for reporting to <gloss target="#t_USLO_1"
                            >USLO</gloss> on activities in these fields.</p>
                    <pb n="444" facs="0493" xml:id="pg_444"/>
                    <p>B. The office would be headed by a cultural counselor who would have prime
                        responsibility for the exchange program in all of its manifestations. He
                        would deal with American academicians and with the Chinese on exchange
                        matters. He would also have supervisory responsibility for all <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> programs.</p>
                    <p>C. Assisting him would be a more junior officer who would be responsible
                        primarily for the non-exchange elements of the program but would assist the
                        cultural counselor as needed. He would share responsibility for dealing with
                        the press with the cultural counselor.</p>
                    <p>D. An absolute necessity would also be a crackerjack <gloss
                            target="#t_admin_1">admin</gloss> secretary, one who could provide the
                        office with the combined talents needed in the special circumstances of the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> where many of the basic <gloss
                            target="#t_admin_1">admin</gloss> talents cannot be found in the local
                        community.</p>
                    <p>E. Four local employees—a librarian (currently on the <gloss
                            target="#t_USLO_1">USLO</gloss> staff); a <gloss
                            target="#t_WirelessFile_1">Wireless File</gloss> operator/audio visual
                        assistant (tentatively approved by the Agency); a distribution clerk; an
                        exchanges assistant. These would have to be supplied by the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, as are all local employees, but our
                        experience with the current librarian indicates that training by <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> staff members from Hong Kong or other
                        places can bring the level of local employee competance to better than
                        acceptability.</p>
                    <p>6. Central to this plan is the course of the negotiations with the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> on the exchange program. Obviously, if the
                        exchange effort suffers a major setback or takes a form thus far unthought
                        of, the needs outlined above will have to be reconsidered. However, given
                        the current massive workload at <gloss target="#t_USLO_1">USLO</gloss> and
                        the speed with which the exchange effort appears to be developing, plus the
                        dramatic expansion of opportunities in other fields, we would do well to
                        seriously discuss these proposals now so as to move quickly after the
                        completion of these talks with the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>7. If the results of the Chou Pei-yuan visit<note n="4" xml:id="d152fn4">In
                            an undated briefing memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"

                            participate in talks with a U.S. group headed by <gloss
                                target="#t_NSF_1">NSF</gloss> President Richard Atkinson and also
                            tour several American universities. The briefing memorandum is printed

                        believe we should begin prompt discussions with State with a view to
                        bringing our staffing arrangements in Peking into accord with the new
                        realities that are emerging in our exchange relationship with the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. Our top priority should be providing John
                        Thomson with a secretary/admin assistant, if possible by November when the
                        first group of <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> English language
                        trainees may be traveling to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>.
                        Assuming that we can <pb n="445" facs="0494" xml:id="pg_445"/>secure state
                        concurrence for the creation of two officer-level <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> positions at <gloss target="#t_USLO_1">USLO</gloss>, we
                        should also move promptly to select a relatively junior officer who
                        hopefully could be transferred here as early next year as feasible
                        (obviously, I would suggest Thomson as our senior man here).</p>
                    <p>8. There will be some inconveniences for those who have to come out here
                        quickly. Living conditions are not good and hotel living will, in all
                        likelihood, be required at first. But the challenges and opportunities are
                        so great that I am sure our agency can come up with appropriate people, as
                        we did with Thomson.</p>
                    <p>9. These thoughts reflect my discussions with <gloss target="#t_USLO_1"
                            >USLO</gloss>, most importantly with the Charge, who as former Deputy
                        Director of <gloss target="#t_PRCM_1">PRCM</gloss> in the Department, is
                        fully cognizant of the history of our activity in China.<note n="5"

                        Mission should reserve its position until Ambassador <persName

                        an opportunity to express his views. A more positive response cannot be

                        there is some additional money in our new budget for exchanges and other
                        activities, there will not be enough to fund all of these costs. I can’t
                        think of a higher priority need in the Agency, however, and trust that you
                        will agree.</p>

                        <salute>Dear <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>In my first letter of this series, I mentioned that I would be discussing
                        with you the role of the library in the Agency’s overall operations.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d154fn2">See <ref target="#d150">Document
                            150</ref>.</note> In this letter, I will indicate the importance,
                        nature, and objectives of our libraries, as well as what we expect of you in
                        their management. Some of you have libraries, some of you do not. The
                        purpose of this letter is not to open or close libraries; rather it is to
                        establish general principles governing their operation, wherever they exist,
                        and unmistakably to point up their fundamental importance in the
                        communication process.</p>
                    <p>Libraries will not run themselves while principal officials turn their
                        attention to “more urgent” matters. Libraries are important; we will treat
                        them as such. Libraries are expensive; they require prudent and direct
                        management by <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> library is an overt expression of
                        the importance of free inquiry and of an informed citizenry. While the
                        library can be a means of communicating specific ideas in the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> programs overseas, it can also be, in
                        itself, a powerful statement about American knowledge, culture and
                        achievements. Our use of libraries must be consistent with the precepts of
                        good communication, the precepts of contemporary American library practices,
                        and the tradition of the American library.</p>
                    <p>Libraries are institutions with a long-term communication objective. The
                        social and intellectual rate of return on libraries cannot be measured in
                        months or even tours of duty.</p>
                    <p>In my first letter, I established the “increase in the intellectual or social
                        momentum on any chosen subject” as our ultimate objective. We should admit,
                        I think, that the stimulation of certain kinds of ideas—including those
                        represented by our libraries—will take time. Indeed, one of the virtues of a
                        library is to serve as a daily reminder—as we deal with the brush fires of
                        the day—that serious communication on serious topics <hi rend="italic"
                            >is</hi> a long-term proposition. We do need to focus on today’s
                        problems, we will focus on these problems, but we also need to avoid the
                        trap of being consumed by them. The task of integrating <pb n="448"
                            facs="0497" xml:id="pg_448"/>a library into an effective communication
                        strategy will force us to probe more deeply into the nature of our
                        communication problems and opportunities. It will force us to keep our eyes
                        on the long haul—as we must.</p>
                    <p>An <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> library <hi rend="italic">must</hi>
                        consist of a core collection containing those books, periodicals and other
                        materials which embody the sustaining ideas of the American past as well as
                        the generative energy of the present. It <hi rend="italic">must</hi> center
                        on American biography, history, philosophy, fiction, drama, and significant
                        works in contemporary social science broadly defined. Every <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> library worthy of the name should offer
                        the best—and only the best—books and journals in these fields; it follows
                        that any foreigner using such a collection becomes important to us, even
                        though we do no more than respond to her or his library needs. The library’s
                        design, collection and evolution must attract segments of the broad student
                        community. Indeed, few resources at the disposal of a <gloss
                            target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> are more adaptable to the student
                        population. When carefully selected students are attracted to and use the
                        materials of your library, count your blessings. Conversely if they do not
                        darken the library door, the burden of explanation is on you.</p>
                    <p>Special circumstances <hi rend="italic">may</hi> justify the inclusion of
                        other materials in the library, materials selected with student and
                        non-student users in mind. The communications needs of your post <hi
                            rend="italic">might</hi> be served by the inclusion of materials on
                        management techniques, for example, or American scholarly works about the
                        host country. But such materials serve an objective different from the
                        central objective which I assign to the library as an institution; you
                        should be able to justify the ways in which these additional materials
                        support important objectives. The core collection itself may change and
                        grow, but by nature will be steady, dependable, relatively timeless.</p>
                    <p>Local institutions may serve the same needs as our core collection. In <hi
                            rend="italic">no</hi> case should we simply duplicate an existing,
                        accessible collection—even for the purpose of “showing the flag” (except of
                        course in certain closed societies like Eastern Europe). Where accessible
                        collections exist, our own efforts should effectively be directed to their
                        enhancement or the creation of special <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>
                        collections or <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> reference centers,
                        assuming of course indigenous cooperation and communication interest.</p>
                    <p>If we accept as our library objective a role in projecting this country’s
                        intellectual resources, inquisitiveness, and openness, our task must be to
                        make the core collection (as defined above) attractive, accessible, relevant
                        and <hi rend="italic">known</hi> to the society in which the library
                        operates. The greatest scope for your talents and creative energy lies in
                        making the library relevant and known in selected circles. While the library
                        exists primarily for those who wish to use it, we should be engaged in
                        raising <pb n="449" facs="0498" xml:id="pg_449"/>the consciousness of local
                        institutions with respect to the intellectual potential which it represents.
                        I depend on you to engage in the development of a close relationship between
                        the library and local institutions. In X country this relationship may be
                        with principal secondary schools, while in Y it may be the social science
                        faculties of selected universities. In short, the determination must be the
                            <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s, there being no precise
                        Washington formula for worldwide application.</p>
                    <p>Do not confuse this point with “outreach” (on which I intend to send you a
                        separate letter). The Agency’s outreach program has been and will continue
                        to be an important vehicle for communicating certain ideas to a few
                        individuals. The library, on the other hand, might be described as the focus
                        of “inreach”—an intellectual resource available to those who wish to use the
                        collection for their own reasons. Your objective should be insuring that the
                        collection is known as an available and highly relevant resource. But we
                        will not deform a library’s strength as a long-term communication instrument
                        in an effort to reach those whom we have traditionally described as “primary
                        audiences” for short-term purposes. If such individuals use the library, so
                        much the better; but your basic purpose should be to link the library to its
                        natural audiences, among which the selected student community should rank
                        high.</p>
                    <p>I define a library’s <hi rend="italic">natural audience</hi> in the following
                        terms: In all societies, some individuals read; others do not. Libraries
                        draw a natural audience from those who visit or otherwise use the
                        institution. Many will be students, teachers, young functionaries; others
                        will be important current mission contacts. If the latter visit and use the
                        library, we shall be elated. But—and I repeat for emphasis—the library must
                        not be deformed to serve only current leaders or the acknowledged elite.
                        Bear in mind that cabinet members and university presidents are not frequent
                        visitors in Bethesda or Boston free public libraries. Those in the natural
                        audience who use the library and grow to understand the knowledge,
                        achievements and values it represents may, indeed, be unidentified potential
                        leaders in the context of the long-term communication objectives the library
                        is designed to achieve.</p>
                    <p>One of your major management responsibilities with respect to the library is
                        the support and development of the local national library staff. The
                        significance of the <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> library will depend
                        in part on the level of literacy and English competency in your host
                        country, in part on alternate sources for books and ideas, but significantly
                        on the quality and activity of the library staff. However extensive the
                        library collection and its supporting facilities, the library’s reputation
                        and effectiveness depend to a large extent on the ability of the staff to
                        respond quickly, constructively and imaginatively. The foreign national
                        librarian who can act as an “intellectual detective” to search out and share
                            informa<pb n="450" facs="0499" xml:id="pg_450"/>tion, to pursue leads,
                        and to refer people to each other may be a library’s greatest resource.</p>
                    <p>Limitations of foreign staff may, in some cases, stop us short of achieving
                        this goal. But the Agency’s professional librarians and training programs
                        for foreign librarians (both of which we intend to enhance) are available to
                        help create institutions where the expectation that “something may happen”
                        is the intellectual stimulus drawing people to the library.</p>
                    <p>We have the resources to achieve our objectives; I expect you to tell us how
                        to put them together. Your Washington colleagues have been very persuasive
                        in arguing that we need from each of you a kind of library Country Plan. I
                        have at least temporarily rejected their counsel because I do not believe
                        that Washington knows exactly what it wants in such a Plan.</p>
                    <p>Hence, what I should like for you to do in the immediate future (say between
                        now and December 15) is to sit down with your staff and work out a library
                        rationale for your country. (This instruction applies to countries with
                        libraries; at this point I am not taking “orders” for establishing
                        libraries, though any proposals will be attentively studied.) Following the
                        principles set forth in this letter, you should determine how the library
                        advances your communication objective, what its natural audience is, what
                        special audiences will be attracted and how. Then forward this Plan to your
                        Area Director and <gloss target="#t_ECAFL_1">ECA/FL</gloss> no later than
                        January 1. It will help them execute their managerial responsibilities. It
                        goes without saying, I hope, that you will also seek the counsel of regional
                        library consultants.</p>
                    <p>One caveat at the risk of sheer repetition: I have indicated that “selected
                        students” are the principal component of the library’s natural audience. The
                        key word, of course, is “selected.” I am very leery of restrictive
                        attendance formulas; on the other hand, I realize full well that libraries
                        must serve some purpose other than warming and cooling their clients. What I
                        want to establish above all else is that the Agency no longer expects you to
                        attract the prime ministers, cabinet members, and other high-level officials
                        who simply do not have the time, nor probably the inclination, to visit your
                        library very often. But there must be and can be visitors—users—and chief
                        among these are selected students. Students have always challenged us as an
                        Agency; let’s accept the challenge.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        report (TAB A) for you on the first six months of the International
                        Communication Agency, which came into being on April 1, 1978. He cites
                        several examples of the effectiveness of this agency’s work, much of which
                        results cumulatively from the efforts of the past, e.g. large <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> listenership in the Soviet Union,
                        participation in past exchange programs by 38 current heads of government
                        and emulation of our cultural exchange programs by many other countries. His
                        agency, as he points out in respect to Camp David, has a capacity to
                        communicate important information rapidly to all parts of the world.</p>
                    <p>What is disturbing in this report, however, is the information that our
                        exchange programs have declined by 57% in constant dollars over <pb n="452"
                            facs="0501" xml:id="pg_452"/>the past twelve years. This illustrates

                        Unless we put more money and assign more talent to this area, our successors
                        ten years hence will not have as much evidence of effectiveness to cite as
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">John Reinhardt</persName> does in this

                    <p>There are many more countries in the world now educating more people for
                        accelerated political, economic and social development than there were even
                        ten years ago. We should expose more of them to the United States so that
                        they will understand us better when they take leadership positions. I would
                        like to have your approval to take up with <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">John

                            indicators of where we stand:</p>
                        <p>—According to <hi rend="italic">Soviet</hi> research statistics (which
                            accord closely with our own estimates), 60%–75% of the urban

                            America.</p>
                        <p>—38 <hi rend="italic">current</hi> heads of government participated
                            during their formative years in our exchange programs (including, for

                        <p>—Our <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName> exchange program
                            has been emulated repeatedly by other countries over the past thirty
                            years—an irony, since, as a result of recurring budgetary restrictions,
                            our exchange programs have declined by 57% in constant dollars in the
                            past twelve years. We also have 29% fewer people on our rolls than in
                            1964 (and may be the only agency in your government which can make such
                            a statement).</p>
                        <p>—France, West Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom each devoted a larger
                            percentage of its 1977 national budget than did the United States to
                            external cultural and information activities. According to <gloss

                            billion a year” on pro-Communist and anti-U.S. propaganda; this compares
                            with our $361 million budget in fiscal 1978.</p>
                        <p>But perhaps the most important indicator of all is the frequency and
                            intensity with which the creation of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                                >ICA</gloss> has been attacked by the Soviets over the past year.
                            These attacks, I believe, reflect both the Soviets’ underlying
                            insecurity (recognition of their disadvantages <hi rend="italic"
                                >vis-a-vis</hi> the United States in the long-term competition of
                            ideas and value systems) and their appreciation of the power of
                            communication and ideas. As Lenin put it in 1924, “ideas are more fatal
                            than guns.”</p>
                        <p>Unlike the Soviets, we as a country and as a government tend to
                            understate the centrality of our ideas and values to our position in the
                            world and how attractive they remain to foreign peoples. It is,
                            therefore, important to focus on the positive impact of your human
                            rights policy at the popular level abroad. As a result of that impact,
                            we appear to be reclaiming something the United States was in danger of
                            forfeiting to Marxism-Leninism—an identification with the future.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that our continued competition with the Soviets and their
                            followers, as well as our relations with the developing nations, will be
                            determined essentially by the force of our ideas and the effective<pb
                                n="454" facs="0503" xml:id="pg_454"/>ness with which we communicate
                            them to the rest of the world. If I interpret your statements and
                            actions correctly, this accords well with your own sense of priorities.
                            It is <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>’s essential work. At the end
                            of our first six months, I believe we can carry this work forward from a
                            position of strength and confidence.</p>

                    <p>3. On July 31, the President approved the establishment of a Hubert H.
                        Humphrey North-South Scholarship program for outstanding young men and women
                        of modest means from all of the developing countries to study for one year
                        of specialized training in the U.S.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d145fn2">footnote 2, Document 145</ref>.</note> The
                        scholarships are to be offered to men and women engaged in public service
                        for a one-year enrichment course in fields related directly to their work,
                        not necessarily leading to a degree.</p>
                    <p>4. The program’s purpose is to help educate a core group of a new generation
                        of developing world leaders. It is designed to provide education and a
                        common experience for a group of future leaders and by so doing provide a
                        compelling symbol of U.S. interest in the developing world. It will seek out
                        talented youth who might otherwise not be able to afford education thereby
                        demonstrating a special American concern for helping the poor and for
                        promoting equality of people. The purpose of the studies will be to enhance
                        the students’ capabilities for public service, in particular to help improve
                        incomes, living standards and employment and enable them to contribute more
                        effectively <pb n="455" facs="0504" xml:id="pg_455"/>to the equitable
                        development of their country. The fields of study should include but not be
                        limited to health, social work, rural or urban development.</p>
                    <p>5. The President has assigned the implementation of the program to the Agency
                        under the authority of Section 102(A)(1) (I)(B) of the <gloss
                            target="#t_MECEA_1">MECEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. Scholarships will be made available to men and women from all developing
                        countries with which we have diplomatic relations on a scale weighted by
                        population (3 for countries over 10 million, 2 for those between 1 and 10
                        million, and 1 for countries with a population of less than 1 million).
                        Placement and supervision in the U.S. will be handled by <gloss
                            target="#t_IIE_1">IIE</gloss>. The first group of students is expected
                        to come to the U.S. in time for the start of academic year 1979–80. Because
                        funds for the program are being made available to the Agency beginning with
                        fiscal year 1980 (i.e., beginning Oct. 1, 1979), the first group of students
                        will have to have a sufficient knowledge of English not to require language
                        training prior to the start-up of courses. In future years, we hope to be
                        able to offer summer intensive English language courses so that students
                        need not have the same level of English capability as we are asking for the
                        first year. In countries with binational commissions, the opportunities for
                        participation in the program should be publicized in the same way that
                        opportunities are now offered for foreign students and the candidates should
                        be selected in the same manner. In countries where there are no binational
                        commissions, <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s should seek to establish
                        jointly with the local government, preferably the Ministry of Education, an
                        adequate screening mechanism. We would expect that such a screening
                        mechanism would provide that in most countries initial screening will be
                        done by local government agencies and a panel of three to five times the
                        number of candidates would be submitted to the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1"
                            >PAO</gloss> for further selection and final approval of the winner(s)
                        by the <gloss target="#t_BFS_1">BFS</gloss>. If this selection procedure
                        poses problems for you, as it might in some countries, you should urgently
                        advise us of the problems you see and we will seek to develop with you
                        alternate methods of selection. All posts and binational commissions should
                        bear in mind that we seek on an overall basis a roughly equal proportion of
                        men and women and you are therefore encouraged to pay attention to worthy
                        women candidates so that this overall proportion may be met.</p>
                    <p>7. Selection criteria: The program requires that candidates be outstanding
                        young professionals, age 25–33, working in disciplines related to the public
                        service for at least two and no more than five years, and unable to afford
                        further education. They should be identifiable as potential future leaders;
                        their education in the U.S. should be directly related to their future
                        career development; they must be assured reem<pb n="456" facs="0505"
                            xml:id="pg_456"/>ployment in their chosen career on return to their home
                        country; they should be of relatively modest family background by
                        participating country standards, and essentially dependent on their own
                        salary for meeting living costs; they should have completed the equivalent
                        of undergraduate university training.</p>
                    <p>8. Summer workshop: at the end of the year-long course of formal study, the
                        program will conclude with a summer workshop which will stress North-South
                        development problems and hopefully also increase the participants’
                        understanding of the U.S. At least part of that workshop will take place at
                        the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of
                        Minnesota. Details about the summer workshop will be supplied later.</p>
                    <p>9. In transmitting to you in this message the basic outline of the program
                        and the administrative requirements placed on you, we recognize that we have
                        undoubtedly not answered all of your questions. You are invited to forward
                        these to the Agency as they develop. Slug telegrams for <gloss

                        Commentaries on the News.</p>
                    <p>1. The Voice of America has initiated in the last ten days a series of
                        regular commentaries on current events. These commentaries are in principle
                        to reflect <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy closely and there
                        will be monitoring of the commentaries within <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss>. The new program has been called to the attention of all

                        wide-ranging autonomy and independence by Congress in carrying out its
                        mission and this should be fully respected. Nevertheless, the policy content
                        of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> commentaries is of high importance
                        to the Department and we believe it should be followed closely. Chiefs of

                    <p>In his opening remarks at this general conference, the President of our 19th
                        session reminded us that 2 years ago there had been a “spirit of Nairobi,”
                        which helped us over difficult times to retain the atmosphere of
                        accommodation that is essential to our activities; and he hoped that we
                        might continue that spirit here in Paris, to aid us in our deliberations at
                        this 20th general conference.<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">Reference is to
                            Deputy Head of the Canadian Delegation Napoleon Leblanc. In his October

                            General Conference, Leblanc stated: “The name of my eminent predecessor
                            [Taaitta Toweett] will always be linked with what has so rightly been
                            called ‛the spirit of Nairobi’, that is: a firm resolve, whatever the
                            difficulties we have to face and the diversity of our respective ideas,
                            to arrive at a consensus that satisfies our fervent desire to achieve a
                            universality based on respect for one another and on mutual
                            understanding, in short—on dialogue.” (“Address by Mr. Napoleon

                    </p>
                    <p>I join in that hope. I propose that we all once again set aside rhetorical
                        politics and defensive expedients in favor of constructive action based on
                        positive principles. With that recaptured spirit, I submit, we can achieve
                        both unity and progress.</p>

                        It has adopted the strongest procedures of any U.N. agency for the handling
                        of human <pb n="458" facs="0507" xml:id="pg_458"/>rights complaints, thereby
                        guaranteeing full and fair international review for the rights enshrined in
                        the <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> Constitution. This represents
                        an important landmark in <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss>’s work
                        in this, the 30th anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human
                            Rights.<note n="3" xml:id="d158fn3">The Universal Declaration of Human

                        important contribution to the international struggle to eliminate racism by
                        adopting, through a consensus of the intergovernmental conference held last
                        March, a draft declaration on race and racial prejudice. When confirmed by
                        this general conference, that declaration will become a major weapon in the
                        continuing struggle, to which we are all dedicated, against racism.<note

                        all governments devoted to human rights. It will contribute to our common
                        endeavors not only at this conference but for generations to come. The

                    <p>On all those matters, and on numerous others in the fields of education,
                        science, and culture—which <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> was
                        created to promote—the United States has been pleased to take an active
                        part. We hope that programs now moving in a promising direction will be
                        carried through to successful culmination. For what we need to strengthen
                        most of all is the sense of direction we recovered in Nairobi, and toward
                        this end to join effective action with the spirit of cooperation.</p>
                    <p>This general theme—the move to a more effective program of action—will be
                        developed by our delegation in each of the program commissions as we address
                        ourselves to the proposed program and budget presented by the Director
                        General [Amadou Mahtar M’Bow of Senegal]. In education, we look to
                        increasing the links between schooling and the world of work, to the
                        extension of educational opportunities <pb n="459" facs="0508"
                            xml:id="pg_459"/>to all segments of society, and to an expansion in the
                        program for population education. In the natural sciences, we will call for
                        a greater focus on priority projects and for the building of scientific
                        capabilities in developing countries. In the social sciences, we will join
                        with others to define major projects and to concentrate efforts on them. In
                        culture, we want to participate in strengthening the sense of cultural
                        identity of all peoples and to recognize, at the same time, the
                        contributions of all cultures to the life of all humankind.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>As I have said, the members of our delegation will develop our views on these
                        matters in the various program commissions. It has always been the view of
                        my government that it is on these matters—the E, the S, and the C of <gloss
                            target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss>—that our major emphasis should be
                        placed. Today, however, I shall of necessity concentrate my attention on the
                        questions that we face in the field of communications. For here we can see
                        the clearest challenge to the continued “spirit of Nairobi.” What are the
                        possibilities for effective action, and how do we find our way from the
                        negative and divisive toward the positive and harmonious?</p>
                    <p>What we have before us first of all is the sound and generally agreed <gloss
                            target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> medium-term objectives and the
                        implementing plan of action proposed by the Director General. These give us
                        the opportunity for much-needed research and study and calm reflection, as
                        we seek to relate the extraordinary potential of communications to a human
                        scale. The United States supports that program. But there are other
                        documents on our desks, which aim to force decisions upon us that cannot, by
                        their very nature, have been fully thought through. What are the most
                        pressing communication needs of the various developing countries? How can
                        they best be met—through restrictive declarations or positive cooperation?
                        What are the best ways of addressing those troubling questions? I shall try
                        in my statement to deal with each of these unresolved problems.</p>
                    <p>We have only just received the interim report of the International Commission
                        for the Study of Communication Problems, and my government has not yet had
                        an opportunity to formulate its reactions in full.<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d158fn7">Following the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> session
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> General Conference,
                            M’Bow established a commission to undertake a review of communications
                            in contemporary society. M’Bow appointed Seán MacBride (Ireland) to head
                            the Commission; members included Elie Abel (United States), Hubert
                            Beuve-Méry (France), Elebe Ma Ekonzo (Zaire), Gabriel Garcia Marquez
                            (Colombia), Sergi Losev (Soviet Union), Mochtar Lubis (Indonesia),

                            report, entitled <hi rend="italic">Many Voices One World</hi> was
                            released by <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> in 1980.</note>
                        Our comments will be provided, as requested, to the Commission. I <pb
                            n="460" facs="0509" xml:id="pg_460"/>can say, however, that we find much
                        to admire in the descriptive portions of the report, which comprise its
                        principal part. The diagnosis is in large measure scholarly and balanced.
                        Our own assessment of world communication importance and needs is—as you
                        will hear shortly—closely congruent with that set forth in the interim
                        report. To that extent we believe a good beginning has been made.</p>
                    <p>But when it comes to the report’s prescriptions, especially those that imply
                        state controls on the operations of the mass media, we find ourselves
                        unpersuaded. No adequate foundation in fact or in principle has been laid
                        for such prescriptions, nor is there any acknowledgement of the losses—to
                        national development, to peace, to international understanding—that they
                        would entail. The closing few pages of the interim report contrast markedly
                        in this respect with those that precede them. They are less balanced, less
                        well grounded, and I trust will accordingly receive the personal attention
                        of Commission members.</p>
                    <p>In his introductory remarks on the mass media declaration, the Director
                        General called for a constructive dialogue that could lead to a consensus.
                        Mr. M’Bow also made reference to the horrors of racism inflicted on the
                        world through the state-controlled media of the Nazi regime; and he reminded
                        us that <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> was created in part to
                        prevent any repetition of such acts. This reflects my government’s position
                        precisely—that it is state controls that have been primarily associated with
                        the propagation of war and hostility and racialism, and that for <gloss
                            target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> to sponsor a return to this stifling
                        of human conscience would be to turn its back on its own charter.</p>
                    <p>Contemporary examples of this basic point are not difficult to find. The
                        governments in southern Africa have reacted to demands for full enjoyment of
                        political and economic rights by closing down newspapers owned by or
                        sympathetic to black Africans. They have also moved to prohibit the
                        circulation of information about the extent and effects of racism in that
                        region. We have recently witnessed similar attempts by governments in other
                        regions to suppress the circulation of documents that draw attention to the
                        violation of human rights. It seems clear from these illustrations that it
                        is freedom of information, and not its control by the state, that is best
                        calculated to achieve the elimination of racism and to promote the
                        attainment of economic and political rights.</p>
                    <p>Of course freedom must be coupled with justice. We have been learning that
                        ourselves in the United States. America is not a single, monolithic society,
                        and its diversity cannot be fully represented by the major newspapers or
                        networks. And so we have been making major efforts in recent years to
                        encourage ownership and operation of media outlets by blacks, women,
                        Hispanics, and others to the end that the distinctive voice of each of these
                        developing groups within our own <pb n="461" facs="0510" xml:id="pg_461"

                        but it is development with and toward freedom.</p>
                    <p>Let me invite your attention at this point to two statements from the report
                        of a task force on the international flow of news, issued just a few days
                            ago.<note n="8" xml:id="d158fn8">Presumable reference to the Twentieth

                        say.</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>It is our unanimous and deeply held belief that freedom of information
                            and economic and political development are inextricably intertwined and
                            mutually reinforcing.</p>

                    <quote>
                        <p>We reject out of hand the view that freedom is something that only the
                            developed nations of the West can afford—and that it is a superfluous
                            luxury for the developing nations. The practices of a free press may be
                            erratic, even in the West, but the aspirations of freedom should
                            ultimately serve to unite the West and the Third World.</p>

                    <p>We ourselves would hope ultimately to persuade many other countries of the
                        merits of this point of view. But we do not now seek to impose that view on
                        other governments. We know how dynamically various are the relationships of
                        these governments to their own mass media and how insusceptible they are to
                        being captured within any single formula or code. If there is diversity, let
                        it continue in the spirit voiced by <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John F.

                            those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our
                            differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity.
                            For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all

                        the continuing spirit of Nairobi. So also is what I have to say today on the
                        subject of practical cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Two years ago when I addressed this general conference in Nairobi, I
                        acknowledged the existence of dependencies, disparities, and imbal<pb
                            n="462" facs="0511" xml:id="pg_462"/>ances in and among national
                        communication capabilities.<note n="10" xml:id="d158fn10">See <ref
                                target="#d63fn8">footnote 8, Document 63</ref>.</note> On that
                        occasion I proposed that measures might be taken by the United States and
                        other developed countries, together with their private sectors and the
                        multilateral institutions, to help other states strengthen their information
                        and communication systems in accordance with their needs. Today I want to
                        describe what has been and is being done on our part, and then move beyond
                        that to propose a system for improved cooperation among all the nations that
                        can, I believe, move us purposefully and measurably toward the realization
                        of our common goals.</p>
                    <p>Let me begin by recalling the scope and dimension of those goals. As I said
                        in 1976, the central issue is to achieve growth with equity and to pay
                        special attention to the poorest of the poor within the nations and among
                        nations. Internal and international disparities often go hand in hand. Of
                        the 400 million telephones in the world, for example, only 40 million—a bare
                        10%—are to be found in all of Africa, Asia, and Latin America combined. What
                        does this imply for the scope of participation in the life of those
                        societies or for two-way information flows within them?</p>
                    <p>A presently pending <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> report to the
                        General Assembly devotes similar attention to the unevenness of
                        communications development within societies, and also points up the
                        existence of gross quantitative disparities among the nations of the world.
                        It reveals that 30 developing countries still have no television service at
                        all nor the technical skills to develop one; in about 40 developing
                        countries, fewer than 5% of the people ever see a newspaper; and in more
                        than 60 countries, where radio broadcasting may be the instrument chosen for
                        nation-building, more than half the population has no radio sets. To this
                        must be added a pervasive shortage of skilled technicians and teachers to
                        build up and extend communication capacities.</p>
                    <p>It should be apparent from this brief recitation that the challenge of
                        communications development is not one that can be met by simple or random
                        infusions of assistance or by the immediate adoption of any formula for a
                        new world order. If we are to have any serious impact, we must proceed in a
                        far more systematic, long-range, and concerted fashion than any we have
                        previously pursued. And we must attract cooperation from every quarter I
                        mentioned 2 years ago—the more prosperous nations, the private sector in
                        those nations, the multilateral institutions, and the disadvantaged
                        countries themselves.</p>
                    <p>Why should we collectively take on this burden?</p>
                    <p>•Because information is increasingly recognized as a basic
                        resource—intangible and inexhaustible but otherwise akin to energy <pb
                            n="463" facs="0512" xml:id="pg_463"/>and materials—that is essential to
                        full participation in the modern world.</p>
                    <p>•Because in the face of this recognition it would be unthinkable for us to
                        allow our nations and our peoples to drift by neglect into two separate and
                        distinct camps, the “information rich” versus the “information poor.”</p>
                    <p>•Because there are some common goals in which we do agree and around which we
                        can construct an action agenda that draws us together and that emphasizes
                        the value of our common institutions, like <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1"
                            >UNESCO</gloss>. Those goals include the steady reduction of disparities
                        and dependencies and imbalances in communication capacities and the
                        progressive fostering of many-sided dialogues rather than monologues in
                        internal as well as international communication structures.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Efforts</p>
                    <p>What can be done, then, to get things started? Two years ago I suggested a
                        collegial effort. The responses we have been hearing at this conference thus
                        far are heartening. More will no doubt be heard, and a great deal more is
                        required if we are to move appreciably towards the attainment of our goal.
                        Let me begin my own contribution by recounting what the U.S. Government has
                        been doing in this field since Nairobi.</p>
                    <p>Our regular foreign assistance program has, in the course of the past 2
                        years, committed $18 million to the cooperative improvement of basic
                        telecommunications infrastructures in developing countries. A further $19
                        million has been committed to the communications and information components
                        of some 70 projects throughout Africa, Asia, the Near East, and Latin
                        America in the fields of education, population, health care, nutrition,
                        agriculture, and disaster relief.</p>
                    <p>We have expended another $4 million on two-way exchanges of communication
                        students, teachers, and practitioners; on studies and conferences; and on
                        media materials—all aimed at improving mutual understanding of communication
                        perspectives. These efforts have directly engaged roughly 1,000 participants
                        from 88 developing countries.</p>
                    <p>We have continued our technical assistance with communications satellites, of
                        which the most prominent example remains the Indian site project I described
                        to you 2 years ago. Its value has been underscored by the recent decision of
                        the Indian Government to establish its own domestic communications satellite
                        system <gloss target="#t_INSAT_1">INSAT</gloss>, to be launched in 1981.</p>
                    <p>A number of U.S. Government agencies are engaged in sharing communication
                        resources and information-system design capacity with their
                        developing-country counterparts in specific fields of common <pb n="464"
                            facs="0513" xml:id="pg_464"/>interest. These include scientific and
                        technical information, weather and disaster warning, health and
                        environmental data, and agricultural information. Other agencies have been
                        working on a regional basis. We have, for example, assisted in the
                        development of regional health information centers in Latin America and the
                        Middle East, in cooperation with local governments and with the Pan American
                        and World Health Organizations. We provide professional consultation by, and
                        practical training in, U.S. communication institutions at the request of
                        foreign government officials or under the auspices of the International
                        Telecommunications Union.</p>
                    <p>Our private sector has also been helping. On the media side, there is one
                        press group that was formed as a result of the Nairobi general conference,
                        with broadly international participation, and that has now raised more than
                        half of its projected million dollar treasury for a variety of projects to
                        assist Third World media development. Our two major wire services<note
                            n="11" xml:id="d158fn11">Associated Press and United Press
                            International.</note> have similarly volunteered their services to help
                        in the establishment of national news agencies. On the very important
                        telecommunications side, we have no comparably specific or coordinated data,
                        but clearly the development potential of this industry’s export and
                        investment transactions is very large.</p>
                    <p>We also need to recognize the contributions of the U.S. private, nonprofit
                        sector, principally the charitable foundations and the universities. Some of
                        them serve in a consulting capacity to <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1"
                            >UNESCO</gloss>, others underwrite the work of such scholarly bodies as
                        the International Institute of Communications and the International
                        Association for Mass Communication Research, while still others actually
                        produce the studies and conferences and reports that will help us gain a
                        better understanding of the communication issues we are faced with. In my
                        own country, there is an effort now underway for the first time to design a
                        comprehensive and readily accessible clearinghouse of all communication
                        policy research undertaken in the various relevant disciplines; upon
                        eventual completion, this should be suitable for interconnection with
                        national research centers in other countries through the <gloss
                            target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss>-affiliated network known as
                        COMNET.</p>
                    <p>There are other institutional developments taking place at the government
                        level in my country with definite implications for communications
                        development. One of these is the creation last April of the International
                        Communication Agency, which has been specifically charged by President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> to promote two-way
                        communication between our people and those of other lands. The new agency
                        has been asked to engage in the development and execution of a comprehensive
                        national <pb n="465" facs="0514" xml:id="pg_465"/>policy on international
                        communications. “Such a policy,” President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> stated, “must take into consideration the needs and
                        interests of others, as well as our own needs.”<note n="12"
                            xml:id="d158fn12">See <ref target="#d93">Documents 93</ref> and <ref
                                target="#d121">121</ref>.</note> This represents, I submit, a
                        significant evolution in the attitude of the United States toward
                        communications development—and one that has taken place since we last met in
                        Nairobi.</p>
                    <p>A second and equally important institutional development was, as many of you
                        know, announced by President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                        in a speech to the Venezuelan Congress in Caracas last March.<note n="13"
                            xml:id="d158fn13">See <ref target="#d123fn3">footnotes 3</ref> and <ref
                                target="#d123fn7">7, Document 123</ref>. In his remarks before the
                            Venezuelan Congress, the President asserted, “For the rest of this
                            century, the greatest potential for growth is in the developing world.
                            To become more self-reliant, developing nations need to strengthen their
                            technological capabilities. To assist them, I am proposing a new United
                            States foundation for technological collaboration.” (<hi rend="italic"
                                >Public Papers: Carter, 1978</hi>, Book I, p. 621)</note> This
                        involves the creation of a U.S. foundation for international technological
                        cooperation. As its name suggests, the foundation will work on a cooperative
                        basis to build technological self-reliance within developing countries. It
                        will work to end dependencies at the same time as it lessens disparities.
                        Since President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s
                        announcement, the process of creating the new foundation has moved forward
                        steadily. We expect to be in operation within the coming year.<note n="14"
                            xml:id="d158fn14">Title <gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> of the
                            International Development Cooperation Act of 1979 (<gloss
                                target="#t_PL_1">P.L</gloss>. 96–53), which the President signed
                            into law on August 14, 1979, authorized the President to establish an
                            Institute for Scientific and Technological Cooperation.</note> I am
                        pleased to tell you today that one of the key programs of the foundation
                        will be devoted specifically to cooperation in the field of information and
                        communications. I personally have high hopes that its efforts with other
                        nations in this sector can make a substantial contribution to our common
                        goals.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">New U.S. Initiatives</p>
                    <p>These developments reflect a genuine commitment on the part of our new U.S.
                        Administration. So do the two specific new projects, growing out of that
                        commitment, that I wish to announce to this conference. The first will
                        devote American assistance, both public and private, to suitably identified
                        regional centers of professional education and training in broadcasting and
                        journalism in the developing world, where such assistance could help the
                        centers equip themselves to produce fully qualified practitioners for the
                        media in the region. Our role will be to work with the faculties and the
                        institutions on their premises. We will undertake to send a senior faculty
                        member or dean of communications to each center for a year’s service as a
                        faculty adviser on curriculum or resource development. Private U.S. news
                        organizations will underwrite the visit to the centers of senior
                        correspondents and <pb n="466" facs="0515" xml:id="pg_466"/>editors, on
                        rotating 3-month assignments, to demonstrate professional skills.</p>
                    <p>As equipment needs are identified, efforts will be made to locate available
                        consoles or studio facilities or printing presses that can be donated to the
                        centers. Institutional funding needs, if any, will be reviewed and
                        assistance offered in presenting them to suitable funding agencies. The
                        visiting professors and journalists will stay no longer than requested; but
                        so long as they are there, they themselves will be learning about Third
                        World development needs and perspectives, in a way that will stay with them
                        when they return to their regular jobs as teachers and gatekeepers of
                        American journalism.</p>
                    <p>This should be a broadly cooperative undertaking. We have assurances of
                        positive participation from media organizations. We solicit the advice and
                        will welcome the participation of other experienced countries. It must of
                        course be the developing countries themselves who identify the regional
                        centers that seem best qualified to serve the joint purposes we would be
                        pursuing. We are working actively with the <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1"
                            >UNESCO</gloss> Secretariat to implement the necessary processes.</p>
                    <p>The second new U.S. project is a major effort to apply the benefits of
                        advanced communications technology—specifically communications satellites—to
                        economic and social needs in the rural areas of developing nations.</p>
                    <p>This program will be implemented with the funding of the U.S. Agency for
                        International Development, using facilities of INTELSAT [International
                        Telecommunications Satellite Consortium] or other appropriate satellite
                        systems, and will enable nations in the developing world to disseminate
                        valuable information to people in remote areas. My government—in cooperation
                        with officials in developing areas—will work to design projects to promote
                        basic literacy for children and adults and to share information on basic
                        health care and other subjects vital to rural development. The basic result
                        should be to take important information—much of which is already available
                        in urban centers of developing nations—and distribute it to remote sections
                        where people have little or no access to knowledge that can improve their
                        way of life.</p>
                    <p>The project I am announcing today will build on the lessons—and the
                        hopes—which have come out of the Indian satellite project and similar
                        smaller experiments in recent years. A major part of the American
                        contribution will be the provision of technical assistance, equipment, and
                        training to promote fully informed use of satellite capacity in the
                        developing nations.</p>
                    <p>We expect to learn much from this new project. But it is much more than a
                        technological demonstration. It is a committed U.S. effort to build
                        communication skills and experience which will enable developing countries
                        to strengthen their own global, regional, and national <pb n="467"
                            facs="0516" xml:id="pg_467"/>communications systems. The programming
                        will be managed by the recipient countries themselves to help meet the basic
                        human needs priorities which they identify. The project will be aimed at
                        building permanent communication technology skills in these countries. At
                        its conclusion, all aspects of management and control will be turned over to
                        the recipient nations, and throughout all of this we hope that the project
                        will develop expertise that will be transferable to other parts of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>We believe that this can mark an innovative, productive approach to urgent
                        problems of rural development and communications, and we are pleased that
                        this project will be moving forward in the months ahead.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Coordinating International Efforts</p>
                    <p>These are the major new initiatives that the United States is taking to help
                        develop a better balance of communications capability throughout the world.
                        But as I have stressed repeatedly, we need more. We need in particular to
                        gather the strength and purpose that can come from the interchange of
                        insights, experiences, and plans—whether bilateral, multilateral, public
                        sector, or private—and from the systematized presentation of development
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>A large part of communications development is now accomplished through
                        bilateral cooperation. It is in this sector that collaborative consultation
                        could serve to detect gaps and overlaps, and to strengthen the presently
                        fragmented process. The bilateral character of such activities need not be
                        changed, but ways should be found to focus them on priority needs in a
                        cooperative way with identifiable goals and measurements of progress. Our
                        study has suggested to us that the international community may have already
                        discovered at least a partial precedent for what is required, in the
                        organization and work of the Consultative Group on International
                        Agricultural Research.<note n="15" xml:id="d158fn15">An initiative of the

                                >CGIAR</gloss>), at the time of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> administration, was a confederation of autonomous
                            research centers and donors who supported the transmission of global
                            agricultural research. The four major research centers included the
                            International Rice Research Institute (Philippines), the International
                            Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (Mexico), the International Institute
                            of Tropical Agriculture (Nigeria), and the International Center for
                            Tropical Agriculture (Colombia).</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The applicability of this precedent to our purposes is not perfect. The
                        agricultural research centers had been in existence for several years before
                        their funding was coordinated; so that the sponsoring institutions took over
                        a fully proven concept. We have nothing like that at present in the field of
                        communications assistance. But is the <pb n="468" facs="0517"
                            xml:id="pg_468"/>analogy nonetheless perhaps worth pursuing? My
                        government believes it may be.</p>
                    <p>The present consultative group is jointly sponsored by the Food and
                        Agriculture Organization (<gloss target="#t_FAO_1">FAO</gloss>), the World
                        Bank, and the U.N. Development Program. We could substitute <gloss
                            target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_FAO_1"
                            >FAO</gloss> as a sponsor. Like the existing group, we could establish
                        an integrated and effective membership consisting of both developed and
                        developing countries, the regional banks, concerned multilateral agencies,
                        and nonprofit foundations. Other appropriate international organizations
                        could certainly be invited to participate. Out of the meetings and studies
                        of a communication consultative group there should emerge a shared sense of
                        development priorities and of the effectiveness of existing and proposed
                        remedies. More than that, we would with the help of the sponsoring
                        institutions—including <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss>—engender
                        cooperation on a scale that simply is not possible under presently existing
                        arrangements. My government would invite our fellow members to consider this
                        possibility with us.</p>
                    <p>The chief obstacle to this kind of constructive endeavor, as I see it, has
                        been the introduction of extraneous political elements. I hope that will
                        change. I hope we can discover and display the seriousness of purpose that
                        alone will attract the sponsorship of serious international bodies.
                        Therefore, I invite the Director General to convene a planning meeting
                        within the next 6 months at which government delegations can seek to reach
                        agreement on a specific proposal that can be presented on behalf of
                        developing and developed countries alike to the institutions whose
                        coordinating sponsorship we would seek. My government is prepared to take
                        full part in these deliberations.</p>
                    <p>My concluding hope is that we will come to agreement—on the communication
                        issues and on all the others we confront—so that together we can move toward
                        making <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> a more effective
                        instrument for meeting historic challenges. For it is through such
                        strengthening of our common purposes that <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1"
                            >UNESCO</gloss> makes its contribution to the cause of peace and
                        international understanding. The minds of men and women are stirred by
                        purposeful participation in programs of effective action—not by mere
                        rhetoric or political posturing. This is <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1"
                            >UNESCO</gloss>’s mission: to provide the means for enhancing practical
                        cooperation in education, the sciences, culture, and communication. Let us
                        get on with the job.</p>

                    <p>The issue is whether, how, and in what time frame to expand our academic and

                        competition for ideas have not kept pace with military outlays and we have a
                        serious lag to make good.” Some indicators of the decline are at Tab B.<note

                    </p>
                    <p>The problem is easily identified: funds appropriated to these exchanges have
                        not kept pace with inflation and the decline of the dollar (academic
                        exchange funds have declined by 57% in constant dollars over the past
                        decade). With the shift in emphasis in our foreign assistance programs, the
                        focus has been on “basic human needs” at the expense of higher education or
                        international exposure. Private foundations and academic institutions have
                        curtailed their own efforts in recent years.</p>
                    <p>As a result:</p>
                    <p>—All of our Western European exchange programs are inadequately funded; 5–6
                        academic programs face the possibility of extinction in the next several
                        years. Several European governments have indicated that, in the absence of
                        significantly increased U.S. funding, they may begin to use their own
                        contributions to these programs for exchange with other countries. (We
                        currently fund only one full-year research grant for an American to all of
                        Scandinavia; the number of French grantees has fallen in 10 years from 309
                        to 67. The <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> attaches such high political
                        importance to these programs that it is now funding 80% of exchanges with
                        the United States; the Bundestag appropriations committee, however, has
                        sought out our Ambassador to express its growing unhappiness at the funding
                        imbalance and to remind us that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> in
                        1974 committed itself to parity funding.)</p>

                        programs funded only 16 American scholars to Brazil in 1977, only 7 American

                        Influential foreigners, brought here to be impressed by the U.S., literally
                        stay in third-rate hotels, travel in the company of inadequately trained
                        escorts and interpreters, or with inadequate attention to their programs
                        from overworked contract agencies. The average duration of academic sojourns
                        has been reduced, typically, from an academic year to a semester or less;
                        the value of stipends has eroded so dramatically as to make it difficult to
                        attract truly authoritative scholars; the value of a grant for a doctoral
                        scholar is now, typically, the cost of an airplane ticket.</p>
                    <p>For 1979–80 we have reprogrammed $2.3 million from other <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> activities into general exchanges; given
                        that all of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>’s activities are engaged in
                        what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName> calls “the
                        competition for ideas” we are now robbing Peter to pay Paul. Reprogramming
                        on a scale commensurate with the needs outlined in this memorandum would
                        represent radical—and not necessarily corrective—surgery.</p>
                    <p>In our view, these exchanges programs should have three goals:</p>
                    <p>(a) To assure, now that it is clear the United States cannot overwhelm its
                        foreign problems by throwing resources at them, that there is an adequate
                        cadre of trained and sensitive Americans to assist this country to live by
                        its international wits;</p>
                    <p>(b) To assure that over the next generation there are successors to the 38
                        heads of state or government who are currently alumni of these programs (or
                        the 11 members of the current Indonesian cabinet, or the 10 of the current
                        French cabinet);</p>
                    <p>(c) To assure that there are enduring personal or institutional links between
                        influential Americans and foreigners of the kind and quality <pb n="471"
                            facs="0520" xml:id="pg_471"/>which can facilitate cooperative address to
                        major international problems and a reciprocal appreciation of values and
                        ideas.</p>
                    <p>As a result of your reaction to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName>’s memo, we have developed a possible “Program for
                        the ‛80’s”. From the 1979 level, and at eventual full funding, the program
                        would represent approximately a $44 million increase in our current
                        exchanges budget of $32 million. The increase would be composed entirely of
                        program funds; there would be no net addition to <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> staff. We would propose that the increase be phased in over
                        a four-year period (doing so would respond to the congressional request in
                        our 1979 Authorization Act that you submit a multi-year program to enhance
                        exchanges).</p>
                    <p>We believe that any new funds should be apportioned according to the
                        following priorities (the rationale for which is at Tab A).<note n="6"

                    <p>We will continue to operate exchanges programs in the poorer <gloss
                            target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s, which will also benefit by your
                        recently proposed program of Humphrey Scholarships for younger public
                        servants nominated for one-year “topping off” educational experiences in the
                        United States. But the preponderance of <hi rend="italic">incremental</hi>
                        funds would be applied as outlined above, particularly in the field of
                        academic exchanges.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we would propose a substantial expansion of an existing small
                        program under which young American public officials (elected and appointed
                        from local, state and federal levels) are exposed to <hi rend="italic"
                            >selected</hi> foreign societies. The current program, administered by
                        the bi-partisan American Council of Young Political Leaders, for example,
                        has focused on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and has created an
                        impressive network of personal relationships among emerging figures in both
                        countries. We would propose not only to increase the numbers of American and
                        foreign public officials participating in this kind of program, but to
                        enhance the learning experience by building short “bursts” of academic study
                        into it.</p>
                    <p>The proposed “Program for the ‛80’s” is explained in greater detail at Tab
                        A.</p>

                    <p>We recommend approval of the program at Tab A and that it form the basis for
                        the required report to the Congress early next year. If you approve, we will

                    <p>We would recommend first-year attention to: (1) a partial restoration of the

                    <p>Measured by classic standards in the field of international public relations,
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> is a superb institution. It is not
                        especially large: Its budget <pb n="476" facs="0525" xml:id="pg_476"/>is
                        little more than $400 million; and its employees number under 4500 Americans
                        and 4500 foreign nationals. The bulk of these resources are devoted to
                        telling the world about U.S. society and policy. This public relations and
                        cultural relations effort aimed beyond our borders and directed with wisdom,
                        care, and economy by <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">John Reinhardt</persName>
                        and his Deputy, <persName corresp="#p_BCW_1">Charles Bray</persName>,
                        functions in a way that well suits the needs of a government proud of its
                        policy and eager to share its ideas and values with the rest of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>As you will recall, the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> was created in
                        the midst of the cold war and was, in the phrase of the Agency motto,
                        designed for “telling America’s story to the World.” With last year’s
                        reorganization, including the addition of the Bureau of Educational and
                        Cultural Affairs from State, the President directed that <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> move toward bringing foreign culture and
                        perspectives to our own people, as well. This mandate seemed particularly
                        timely since our foreign policy was likely to be understood only if our
                        people became aware of the extensive global change and associated political
                        and cultural activism of the previously passive world majority. It is clear,
                        however, that this process of education and communication with our own
                        people has barely begun at <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>. I start
                        with this point because inadequate domestic understanding seems to be a weak
                        link in our foreign policy chain. The <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> administration must do a better job of helping the
                        American people understand the world forces amid which Administration policy
                        is shaped.</p>
                    <p>This matter of informing our people about the rest of the world is somewhat
                        different than informing our people about our foreign policy. <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> is prohibited by law from making its
                        materials intended for foreign distribution also available at home. This is
                        justified as an effort to guard against the agency being used to boost the
                        “political” fortunes of whichever Administration happens to be in power.
                        This concern is understandable since the communications materials
                        distributed abroad by the Agency tend to emphasize the positive themes of
                        our society and the President is always cast in a favorable posture.</p>
                    <p>However, from the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> perspective, <gloss

                    <p>—Population shifts and the end of Western colonialism;</p>
                    <p>—Political awakening of the rest of the world resulting from literacy and new

                    <p>As you will recall, interest was demonstrated by the President, and by you,
                        in the overseas programs for educational and cultural exchange during the
                        recent budget review. Increased funding levels were suggested, but an <gloss

                        another year was accepted by the President. My observation is that these
                        programs receive inadequate attention from your staff and that there should
                        be a closer liaison between <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> in the outline of these programs and in
                        the process generally. But these intercultural communication efforts are
                        never at the top of any one <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff
                        member’s list of priorities. These programs could be much more closely
                        interwoven into the main thrust of our foreign policy if they received more
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> attention, particularly with an eye
                        to shaping our domestic consciousness.</p>
                    <p>Directly related is the need for better coordination of government-wide
                        programs of an educational and cultural nature. <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> staff members should have an idea of who is being sent

                    <p>At the President’s direction, a program for increasing educational and

                            >NSC</gloss> staff member should be assigned to give this priority, and

                    <p>In the original <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, the Agency head was a
                        member of the National Security Council, was to provide advice and guidance
                        on foreign attitudes, and was to be a counselor on these matters to the
                        President. To facilitate this role, the Agency had, as a key official, an
                        Assistant Director for Research. A substantial budget and a large staff was
                        devoted to the effort. Gradually, though, the White House came to pay
                        increasingly less attention to the formal advisory role of the Director. The
                        Research Directorate began to conduct research that tried to show that the
                        Agency itself was a vital and useful organization. While polling data,
                        attitudinal studies, and other reports were still available, these materials
                        did not seem to be used by those concerned with the main direction of
                        American policy.</p>
                    <p>This area was of particular interest because one of the main goals of this
                        study has been to try to find ways to enhance the capacity of <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> to provide useful inputs into the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> decision process. As part of the
                        reorganization of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>, Director <persName

                        department to become more relevant, to become more involved with the main
                        thrust of our foreign policy. Specifically, under a plan adopted last month,
                        the work of the new <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> research department
                        would enable those concerned to:</p>
                    <p>—take foreign reactions and opinion shifts into account in carrying out
                        current U.S. policies;</p>
                    <p>—assess the likely impact of foreign opinion on possible future policy
                        directions;</p>
                    <p>—be conscious of elite and mass attitudes toward specific international
                        issues of interest to the U.S.;</p>
                    <p>—understand the climate of opinion which defines the limits within which
                        foreign leaders and negotiators operate;</p>
                    <p>—identify broad social, cultural, and value changes in foreign countries for
                        the purposes of long and short-term policy planning.</p>
                    <p>Until now, <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> research has generally been
                        of limited value to <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff members. With

                    <p>With current staffing, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> has limited

                        <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> has conducted the first successful
                        survey of Soviet citizens undertaken by a Western governmental agency.</p>
                    <p>In the period October 1977 to June 1978, 1,921 readers of <hi rend="italic"
                            >America Illustrated</hi>, <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>’s
                        Russian language magazine, replied to questions on their reading habits and
                        preferences. Earlier attempts at such a survey yielded replies of 100 or
                        less.</p>
                    <p>The most significant fact about this survey was that it took place and
                        produced substantial returns. This fact does not necessarily signal Soviet
                        willingness to permit more extensive Western polling in the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> or more sensitive topics for
                        questioning. Evidence from other efforts to ask systematic questions of
                        Soviet citizens indicates that the Soviets remain very sensitive to such
                        efforts and are willing to halt them if they feel that acceptable norms are
                        breached.</p>
                    <pb n="481" facs="0530" xml:id="pg_481"/>
                    <p>It should also be noted that readers for the first time were offered a
                        premium (a set of American prints) for responding. Nonetheless, 1,921
                        readers did fill in the questionnaire with their names and addresses on it
                        and sent it to the American Embassy.</p>
                    <p>The following are key findings from the magazine survey:</p>
                    <p>—Preference for cultural themes: The subjects of the articles found most
                        interesting were predominantly cultural or scientific/technical rather than
                        political or economic. In suggesting topics for future articles, respondents
                        showed a marked preference for cultural themes, especially music.</p>
                    <p>—Accent on youth: The typical respondent was under 30, male, and had a
                        secondary school education. One in three respondents was a student or pupil,
                        one in seven an engineer, and one in nine a worker.</p>
                    <p>—Widespread distribution: Reponses were received from 216 identifiable towns
                        and cities, including 77 of the 85 cities where <hi rend="italic">America
                            Illustrated</hi> is supposed to be distributed by agreement with the
                        Soviet government. Almost half of the responses were from Moscow, followed
                        distantly by Leningrad, Kiev, and Tbilisi.</p>
                    <p>—Steady readership: The average respondent had been reading <hi rend="italic"
                            >America Illustrated</hi> for slightly more than three years. Academics,
                        artists, media workers, and scientists tended to be longer-term readers than
                        respondents in other professions.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_HPB_1">Henze</persName>, <persName

                            Evening Report to the President that <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> had met with representatives from <gloss

                                >VOA</gloss> regarding American broadcasting to Iran. He continued,
                                “<gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> will begin broadcasting in
                            Persian in about six weeks. State will also ask the Chinese and Germans
                            to take account of Soviet propaganda against us in their own Persian
                            language broadcasting. In response to the above, the President said: ‛We
                            should have prepared for this 3–4 months ago—make this <gloss

                            Communication Agency: 1–5/79)</note> that the Voice of America was not
                        prepared to broadcast in Persian in Iran when trouble began developing
                        there. I realize that commendable efforts are being made to inaugurate
                        Persian-language broadcasts as soon as possible and the President is aware
                        of these. We can all see, however, that Persian-language broadcasts over
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> would be much more effective if
                        they had already been continuing for a long time, with an experienced staff,
                        and had built up a dependable audience in Iran. We should draw a lesson from
                        this experience and reexamine our priorities in international broadcasting
                        to see whether we are likely to have the capability for communication with
                        other key countries in the future. Please review present allocation of
                        languages and transmitter time in light of both our current foreign policy
                        priorities and with attention to areas where we might face a need for
                        enhanced ability to communicate during the next few years and advise what
                        adjustments and additions you believe should be made. I would like to have
                        the results of this review no later than 7 March. (C)</p>

                    <p>In addition, please undertake a review of transmitter needs during the coming
                        decade in comparison with known and anticipated Soviet and other plans for
                        expansion and develop recommendations for whatever additional investment it
                        might be desirable for the United States to make to ensure our ability to
                        compete in this area. This survey should be worldwide in scope, but I hear
                        that Soviet transmitter power directed southward at the whole area from the
                        Eastern Mediterranean over to the Indian subcontinent has given them
                        advantage over all Western broadcasting, so the review should take an
                        especially close look at the challenges we face in the Middle East and
                        contiguous parts of Africa. This second survey should be ready no later than
                        May 1, 1979.<note n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">In a February 16 memorandum to

                        below.</p>
                    <p>There is no question that the Soviets have been attempting to exploit the

                        during the past two weeks have taken or decided upon the following
                        actions:</p>
                    <p>—A Persian-language shortwave service on <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                        >ICA</gloss>’s Voice of America (<gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>) is
                        scheduled to begin in mid-March.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> Foreign Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_OHD_1">David Owen</persName> will review with the <gloss
                            target="#t_BBC_1">BBC</gloss> our request that it allow <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> to use its transmitter on Masirah Island,
                        off the coast of Oman.</p>
                    <p>—Over the next few months <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> and State
                        will, within current budgetary limits, prepare to give increased stress to
                        cultural exchange between Iran and the United States once the political
                        environment in Iran permits.</p>
                    <p>Beyond these specific actions, we believe it would be unwise to launch a
                        vigorous new program of comprehensive public diplomacy until it is clear
                        that the Iranians have sorted themselves out politically. When the time
                        seems appropriate and we are able to resume full-scale operation of our
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> resources in Iran, we plan to focus
                        on the following themes:</p>
                    <p>—Both Iran and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> have strong spiritual
                        heritages, and the people of both countries believe in the importance of a
                        life that is guided by moral principles.</p>

                    <p>In 1972 and again in 1976 the Agency completed definitive studies identifying
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> language priorities and technical
                        facilities needed to transmit <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> programs
                        to intended audiences abroad. The studies were done within the framework of
                        the Agency’s overall mission to communicate with foreign audiences, taking
                        into account the efficacy of other media and the activities of overseas
                        posts as well as the effectiveness of the radio medium as a communications
                        tool vis-a-vis a given audience. The time period of each of the two studies
                        was five to seven years. Tab A<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">Attached but not

                    <p>This review, in response to your memorandum,<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">See
                                <ref target="#d163">Document 163</ref>.</note> adds an important new
                        dimension: it identifies those additional languages and areas where during
                        the next few years we face or might face the necessity of enhancing our
                        ability to communicate by radio, independent of, or in the absence of, other
                        methods of communication. What languages to what areas should we be
                        broadcasting in order to preserve for the United States the capability to
                        communicate publicly, if other methods are not available to us?</p>
                    <p>Following consultation among Agency geographic area specialists, Department
                        of State geographic bureaus and <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        broadcast specialists, we believe that, in addition to our current broadcast
                        schedule (see Tab B):<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">Attached but not printed
                            at Tab B are a March 1979 chart entitled “Voice of America Current

                    <p>a) we should begin broadcasting in three new languages—Azeri,<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d165fn5">Radio Liberty broadcasts ½ hour daily with 2½ hour

                        Lingala;</p>
                    <p>b) we should increase English programs to East and South Asia, the Middle
                        East, Europe, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean to be more
                        competitive with Radio Moscow’s expanded English-language World Service (235
                        hours per week vs. 223 hours by <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> at

                    <p>c) we should increase Portuguese, Swahili and Hausa to Africa; Persian to
                        Iran, Afghanistan and Tadzhikistan; Hindi, Bengali and Urdu to India,
                        Bangladesh and Pakistan; French to North Africa; Indonesian and Thai to
                        Southeast Asia; and Ukrainian to reach the Soviet Far East;<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d165fn6">We are convinced that audiences, wherever possible,
                            should be able to hear <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> at least

                    </p>

                        as well as to increase Greek and Turkish, as needed, within a three-month
                        period;</p>
                    <p>e) we should replace a three-hour daily Russian program to the Soviet Far
                        East, (now repeated from European transmissions) with a live program
                        targeted for that area.</p>
                    <p>Details are listed in Tab C.<note n="7" xml:id="d165fn7">Attached but not

                            Area—Proposed.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that the Soviets broadcast in several African languages,
                        we carefully explored with the Department of State the question of
                        broadcasting in additional African indigenous languages, particularly in the
                        local languages of southern Africa. Our conclusion is that it would be
                        politically inadvisable at this time, primarily because it would be widely
                        perceived as favoring certain groups over others. English, furthermore, is
                        widely used throughout the region, even among persons with only minimal
                        education.</p>
                    <p>The above additions and modifications would increase <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss>’s weekly schedule from the current 820 hours to 942½ hours.
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> would be broadcasting in 41
                        languages. Additional funds of $5.8 million and an additional personnel
                        complement of 159 would be required. (Tab D<note n="8" xml:id="d165fn8"

                    <p>Our current technical facilities can accommodate most of these additions,
                        although <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> signals will continue to be
                        hampered by the necessary use of less effective low-powered transmitters
                        until the present construction program is completed in late 1982.</p>
                    <p>With these additions and modifications we believe that <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> will be broadcasting in vernacular
                        languages—or have the capability to mount new programs within a short lead
                        time—to all those areas where the United States might reasonably face a need
                        for enhanced ability to communicate by radio during the next few years.</p>
                    <p>I should emphasize that the additional broadcast services recommended above,
                        while not listed in priority order because of the unpredictability of crisis
                        situations, are of lower priority than our current broadcasts.</p>

                        facilities, which will be delivered May 1, will go beyond this report in

                        hours of broadcasts in each language (both existing and recommended) as

                                >209</ref>. At a January 31 White House ceremony, Deng and the
                            President signed the cultural agreement and an agreement on cooperation
                            in science and technology. At the same ceremony, <persName

                            200–211.</note> We now face the task of giving that agreement specific
                        meaning. The Agreement assigns responsibility on our side to <gloss

                        Culture as the main implementing agency. (U)</p>
                    <p>We are fortunate that the Minister of Culture in China is the former head of
                        the Liaison Office here, <persName corresp="#p_HH_1">Huang Chen</persName>.
                        I believe we should strike while the iron is hot, making use of <persName

                        society. (C)</p>
                    <p>I would also observe that our bilateral relations with China can now be
                        divided into three categories: economic relations, where we are moving ahead
                        under <persName corresp="#p_BWM_1">Mike Blumenthal</persName>’s leadership;
                        science and technology, where we are moving ahead under Frank Press, and
                        culture. Clearly, the latter, as far as governmental contacts are concerned,
                        is the laggard among the three. (C)</p>

                    <p>The Commission is under-funded, and is in search of $100,000 to fund a

                    <p>We have not had a major assessment of our knowledge base concerning foreign
                        languages and international studies in several decades. There is a general
                        consensus both in and out of government that we are suffering an erosion in

                        to undertake such a national assessment. In addition, I recommend that you

                            xml:id="d168fn3">In a March 26 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName>, Turner indicated that he endorsed the
                            establishment of the Commission, adding that the Central Intelligence
                            Agency had engaged in discussions with <persName corresp="#p_PJA_1"
                                >Perkins</persName> and the Commission members regarding <gloss

                            international education. Turner continued, “With respect to the funding
                            problem you mentioned, the $25,000 contribution requested from <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is a very modest amount indeed and, as
                            such, would be no problem. I am more concerned, however, that in our
                            enthusiasm to support this effort—by providing even a small amount of
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> funding—we might be making the
                            Commission’s task more difficult. While I feel confident that <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has a legitimate interest in such an
                            assessment, others in the academic community, the media, or the general
                            public might question the basis for <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                            funding a study involving <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> educational
                            institutions. There is in fact some question about <gloss

                            a Commission such as this.” He suggested that in light of these
                            concerns, <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> would agree
                            “that it is preferable to avoid the use of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"

                    <p>I have just been alerted to an idea that <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">David
                            Rockefeller</persName> may want to raise with the President—if he has
                        not already done so—and I want to be sure that you are aware of it as well.
                        According to our Public Affairs Officer in Brazil, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD_1">Rockefeller</persName> discussed the following with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SRM_1">Sayre</persName> during his
                        just-concluded trip to Brazil:</p>
                    <pb n="494" facs="0543" xml:id="pg_494"/>
                    <p>1. On his recent, extensive travels around the world, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD_1">Rockefeller</persName> has found many chiefs of state
                        and heads of government in smaller countries openly questioning the
                        steadfastness of American leadership.</p>
                    <p>2. He believes that many of these leaders’ doubts and uncertainties might be
                        dispelled if they could meet personally, if only for an hour, with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>.</p>
                    <p>3. Since the likelihood of a series of state visits by such leaders is small,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Rockefeller</persName> suggests a series of
                            <hi rend="italic">unofficial</hi> visits, with most or all of the
                        funding coming from the interested private sector and <hi rend="italic">a
                            private meeting with the President assured</hi>.</p>
                    <p>4. While in Washington, the visiting leaders could also meet with key cabinet
                        or sub-cabinet officials in departments and agencies of greatest interest to
                        his country, as well as with prominent academic leaders, public affairs
                        councils, journalists and so on.</p>
                    <p>I believe this idea has merit and is worthy of your, and the President’s,
                        consideration. Should a decision be made to pursue it further, we are
                        prepared to work with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Rockefeller</persName>
                        and others that may be involved in developing the details of the proposed
                        visits.</p>

                        conclusions. (U)</p>
                    <p>We find your recommendations for technical expansion of <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> during the 1980’s reasonable and justified
                        in terms of basic foreign policy priorities. We endorse them fully. We would
                        like to see you incorporate these plans in your budget projections for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1981 and beyond. The political issues
                        involved in setting up new transmitters for broadcasting to south and
                        central Asia should be systematically assessed as soon as possible so that
                        negotiations can get under way and serious technical preparations can begin.
                        Please assess these questions with the help of the Department of State and
                        give us a status report by September 1, 1979. (C)</p>
                    <p>We find your conclusions in respect to expansion of broadcasting time and
                        broadcasting staff realistic and recommend you also provide in current
                        budget planning for the modest expenditures this expansion will entail over
                        the next two or three years. (U)</p>
                    <p>On language priorities, we welcome your plans for further expansion of the
                        Persian service which you have recently inaugurated. Atten<pb n="497"
                            facs="0546" xml:id="pg_497"/>tion should be given to the need to adjust
                        broadcasting hours to improve prospects of attracting an optimum audience in
                        Afghanistan and Soviet Central Asia as well as in Iran itself. (C)</p>
                    <p>In respect to new languages, we concur in the priority of Azeri, but as next
                        priorities we propose Amharic, Pushtu and Tamil rather than Mongolian and
                        Lingala. The potential audience for Mongolian seems too small. Broadcasts in
                        Lingala would undoubtedly be useful but the need for better communication
                        with Ethiopia, where Soviet influence is continually becoming more
                        predominant, is greater. (C)</p>
                    <p>We have noted from your current broadcast schedule that <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is still beaming 35 hours per week to the
                        three countries of Indo-China, with 64 million people, while only 21 hours
                        per week go to the whole Indian subcontinent, with a population between
                        800–900 million. I should think there would be a case for reducing broadcast
                        time in Vietnamese, if necessary, to permit more broadcasting in the native
                        languages of the Indian subcontinent. Exactly what mix of Indian languages
                        would be best should separately be evaluated but we clearly ought to do more
                        than we are now doing. (C)</p>
                    <p>I will be happy to meet with you and your staff to discuss any of these plans
                            further.<note n="4" xml:id="d171fn4">In a June 21 memorandum to

                            xml:id="d172fn2">For the plan, see the attachment to <ref target="#d174"
                                >Document 174</ref>.</note> In carrying out this assignment, you
                        should be guided by the following:</p>
                    <p>1. The plan should derive in the first instance from a careful analysis of
                        the 1980 Country Plan submissions. It should specifically address itself to
                        the cultural problems identified by the posts in these plans.</p>
                    <p>2. The plan should be detailed. It should specifically state what kind of
                        cultural communication efforts we plan to undertake in which countries or
                        areas of the world, within what time frame and at what cost. (It is not
                        adequate merely to state that we will undertake one performing arts program
                        and/or one plastic arts program in each country. Such an approach is far too
                        simplistic, lacking the required level of judgment, discrimination,
                        sophistication and sense of priorities.)</p>
                    <p>3. The plan should be built on the concept of <hi rend="italic"
                            >sustained</hi> communication. It must not be scattershot, episodic or
                            <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi>. The point is that if there is a cultural
                        tension to be addressed in a given country, this—as with all communication
                        efforts—can only be done successfully over time and on a carefully planned,
                        coordinated basis.</p>
                    <p>4. The plan should include a detailed concept for the coordinated application
                        of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> relevant elements of the Agency. If we are to
                        address a cultural tension in a given country, how will we bring to bear—in
                        coordinated, mutually reinforcing, cost-efficient manner—speakers, <gloss
                            target="#t_VTR_1">VTR</gloss>’s and films, publications, the Voice of
                        America, Cultural Presentations, the posts, etc.?</p>
                    <p>5. The plan must contain a specific menu of needs, criteria, timetables and
                        available funding that can be presented immediately to the Endowments for
                        the kind of input envisioned in our agreement with them.</p>
                    <pb n="499" facs="0548" xml:id="pg_499"/>
                    <p>6. The plan should contain detailed, justified budget figures for all
                        proposed efforts.</p>
                    <p>7. The plan should include a detailed scenario which will enable us to
                        maximize the support (including financial) of other institutions—other
                        government agencies, private institutions, corporations and foundations. How
                        should we proceed and with whom?</p>
                    <p>This plan should be presented to me for review no later than Friday, July 13.
                        I realize that this is an unusually tight deadline, requiring extraordinary
                        effort on your part. But I think it imperative that we have the proposed
                        plan before basic budget decisions are made toward the end of July. The
                        thought and work that you have already given to this subject, and the fact
                        that your analysis of the Country Plans is nearing completion, should give
                        you a head start. Finally, I emphasize that the quality and persuasiveness
                        of the plan you present will be central to my determination of how we
                        proceed in fiscal year 1980.</p>

                    <p>Attached is the plan requested in your memorandum of June 28.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d174fn2">See <ref target="#d172">Document 172</ref>.</note> We
                        consulted all Agency elements in its formulation; we did not, however,
                        incorporate all of their suggestions, and changed many of them. I alone am
                        responsible for the contents of this proposal.</p>
                    <p>We began this exercise with the assumption that each region or sub-region of
                        the world would require a substantially different plan, based on different
                        cultural concerns, differences in the extent of access to and appreciation
                        of the American arts, and differences in the levels of “sophistication” of
                        our audiences. In short, we believed that we would need to say different
                        things to different peoples through different—and most “culturally
                        acceptable”—art forms. We culled Country Plans and area offices alike to
                        determine the different foci of each region.</p>
                    <pb n="501" facs="0550" xml:id="pg_501"/>
                    <p>We were wrong. There are, certainly, important cultural differences among
                        nations. We no longer believe, however, that our starting assumption is <hi
                            rend="italic">essentially</hi> valid; within the rule of reason (we
                        might send the most “avant” of the avant-garde to Paris but not Peking) the
                        Agency needs to say essentially the same thing about the arts in America to
                        everyone. This puts us into direct disagreement with <gloss target="#t_AF_2"
                            >AF</gloss>, for example, who would have us emphasize black American art
                        in Africa. (Though I believe that whatever we send to Africa should contain
                        representative works by black artists, and that the didactic context that we
                        provide through our other products should place their contributions in
                        perspective.) It also rejects the collective wisdom of many that because
                        country-western music is popular in a given country, our cultural
                        presentations should emphasize it. We are therefore presenting a rationale,
                        communication themes, and products we believe to be valid on a worldwide
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>At the resource and logistics level for very expensive “one time” activities
                        such as cultural presentations and fine arts exhibitions, regional groupings
                        do make sense; these activities can only travel so far for the buck.
                        Accordingly, the plans for <gloss target="#t_CP_1">CP</gloss> and
                        exhibitions are presented on a regional basis. Specifically regarding this
                        part of our presentation, however, there are some underlying assumptions on
                        my part that should be tabled here.</p>
                    <p>—The cost estimates are pretty shaky and could be well far off the mark at
                        both ends of the range. They are based on our experience—and our experience
                        is not very rich in trying to do anything other than “pick up” cultural
                        presentations already traveling. I have provided you with essentially the
                        list of cultural presentations that I was provided by <gloss
                            target="#t_ECAIC_1">ECA/IC</gloss>—although I will admit to changing
                        figures which I took to be extraordinarily high, and emphasizing soloists
                        and duos over large groups. I have no way of knowing whether or not <gloss
                            target="#t_ECAIC_1">ECA/IC</gloss> can deliver on an increase of this
                        order of magnitude, although that order of magnitude is theirs.</p>
                    <p>—I believe you should read this section of the paper as suggestive only. In
                        fact, I believe that a real partnership with the Endowments can reduce some
                        significant overhead costs, as would inclusion under the Indemnification
                        Act, and the very real possibility that our program will inspire increased
                        private entrepreneurship in countries where none exists. Too, with a
                        sufficiently diversified menu—in time, place, and cost, I believe we can
                        really engage the private sector, along the lines outlined in Tab D.<note

                    <p>—I am banking on your siding with me in the controversy over scale. The
                        preponderant opinion in the Agency is to go with the “biggies”—large
                        exhibits and large troupes that equate with an “event.” While I am not
                        opposed to the occasional “event,” our multiple purposes—exchange, linkage,
                        thrift of resources and staff time, are also well served by the deployment
                        of solo or duo instrumentalists, vocalists or folk musicians to take on
                        elite audiences in the Ambassador’s salon, our cultural center, the
                        university auditorium.</p>

                        have (or can reprogram internally, in the case of T and P) in our budgets
                        for those activities. The order of “new” money for <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                            >FY</gloss>–80 is large. I recommend strongly that should you decide to
                        augment the amount of resources we devote to the arts only incrementally,
                        you give highest priority to the proposed magazine.<note n="4"

                    <p>And speaking of the magazine, it is truly the linchpin of “what’s new” in

                        Endowment has put together a working group of this country’s leading
                        creative intellectuals to blaze a trail in the media arts. There is good
                        reason to believe that the arts in America will, in the next decade, break
                        out of their traditional museum and stage modes; the arts will belong to
                        everyone <hi rend="italic">through the media</hi>. In short order, the
                        Endowment will provide us with a mother lode of people, materials, and ideas
                        that will enable P, T, and <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> to be a part
                        of this cultural breakthrough, and carry it to the rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we are not including recommendations for the bureaucratic
                        organization or reorganization of those parts of the Agency’s elements which
                        deal with the arts in this paper. Such suggestions will derive from your

                        </p>
                        <p>The reasons for integrated and coordinated programming on the arts in
                            America on a world-wide basis are compelling.</p>
                        <p>This year’s Country Plans suggest some very basic and deeply held foreign
                            perceptions of our society and the forces that motivate it. Too many
                            abroad see our strengths as limited to the technological, the
                            scientific, the managerial. Too many see us as crass and consumately
                            materialistic, out for the fast buck and little moved by humanist or
                            spiritual values.</p>
                        <p>The natural concomitant of these perceptions (and perhaps the inevitable
                            result of the sweep of our economic and political influence) is the
                            accusation of cultural imperialism. We are too often seen as blind to
                            the traditions and vigor of other cultures—a powerful member of the
                            world community that lacks even the most rudimentary understanding of
                            the needs and strengths of its neighbors. Ours is the newest culture, an
                            “up-start” that lacks the civilizing values of history and
                            tradition.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the reasons for these perceptions of American life and culture,
                            the problem for us is fundamental: they form a canted and even dangerous
                            context for international communication in a world of inevitable and
                            increasingly intractable political and economic conflicts. A nation
                            whose basic goals are peace and a fuller life for all must be perceived
                            as having a human face, as understanding and appreciating the
                            achievements of others, if it is to gain the participation of others in
                            pursuit of its goals.</p>
                        <p>The arts speak to these perceptions directly, in a language which
                            transcends cultural difference; just as “the Eroica”<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d174fn6">Reference is to Beethoven’s Symphony No. 3 in

                            as well as Germans, the constructions of <persName corresp="#p_NL_1"
                                >Louise Nevelson</persName> are as aesthetically moving to Filipinos
                            and Greeks as they are to Americans. With the simplicity and integrity
                            born of the <pb n="504" facs="0553" xml:id="pg_504"/>fact that the arts
                            constitute our vision <hi rend="italic">of</hi> ourselves <hi
                                rend="italic">for</hi> ourselves, they proclaim to the rest of the
                            world that we are significantly more complex than popular stereotypes
                            would have us:</p>
                        <p>—We value tradition but are not bound to it; we push the limits of the
                            past to the future.</p>
                        <p>—We are materialistic and enchanted with technology; <hi rend="italic"
                                >and</hi> we are consumed with questions of value, ethics,
                            aesthetics;</p>
                        <p>—We are fiercely individual and competitive; <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
                            we value the group, the community, the collective good;</p>
                        <p>—We have the best of hopes and the worst of fears for the future of
                            mankind;</p>
                        <p>—We are energetic and activist, as well as contemplative; elitist as well
                            as populist; sacred as well as profane; and a thousand other things, all
                            at once.</p>
                        <p>Thus are the arts more than the sum of their simple components. They are
                            the “human face” of this nation. They are proof that we are a vital,
                            individualist, free and questioning people engaged in the search for
                            improvement in man’s nature as well as his condition. They are witness
                            to the United States as a society deserving respect and, importantly,
                            trust.</p>
                        <p>All of this does not imply that American arts themselves—or some parts of
                            them—are not appreciated and admired by many overseas. To the contrary,
                            studies reveal that those who have had access to the best of American
                            arts (this usually means the most “sophisticated” of the urban
                            populations of the “first world”), very much respect them.</p>
                        <p>But there are two important points to be made in this context. The first
                            is that the number of foreigners who have had access to our arts is very
                            small. Most of the world (and even most of the much smaller world of
                                <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> publics) has <hi
                                rend="italic">not</hi> had access to our very expensive best. Most
                            of the world has been the “beneficiary”, through the revolution in mass
                            communications, of American culture through our routine and often shoddy
                            film and television products. They have been denied our best—both
                            because of its prohibitive cost, and because they have permitted our
                            worst to dominate their vision—not recognizing that their own impulses
                            have attracted our <hi rend="italic">Kojaks</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                >Angels</hi>,<note n="7" xml:id="d174fn7">References are to the

                                crime drama “Charlie’s Angels.”</note> even as they abhor them.</p>
                        <p>More importantly, whether or not our arts are admired as arts, their
                            commercial distribution cannot exploit their larger dimension. It is not
                            enough to simply display our arts, in the hope that they will <pb
                                n="505" facs="0554" xml:id="pg_505"/>somehow achieve the
                            communication that they so powerfully portend. It is certainly not
                            enough to continue in the <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> and episodic
                            fashion that has heretofore characterized our activities in this area.
                            Without in any way trying to mold or control <hi rend="italic">what</hi>
                            the arts say about the United States, we must utilize the full range of
                            the Agency’s assets to provide a continuous and integrated explanation
                            of them and of the society that gives them birth—a kind of sociological,

                    <p>Tuesday morning<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">July 17.</note> I met with the 60
                        American senior faculty and graduate students who will spend a year in the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. It was a stimulating session. The
                        point is that through careful hard work, a clear eye, <pb n="506"
                            facs="0555" xml:id="pg_506"/>and the appropriate expertise both in

                            >USICA</gloss> has emerged as the lead agency. It is true that the
                        legislation fits well with us and that we have some of the most flexible
                        money. Nonetheless, you will remember that six months ago the Federal
                        agencies were in great disarray about both receiving scholars from China and
                        sending Americans to work there. In this two-day orientation given by the
                        executive agent, the Committee on Scholarly Communication with the People’s
                        Republic of China, most of the speakers were scholars or persons with

                        important to preserve this leadership and expertise, to develop it in
                        additional persons, and to try to have in key roles persons who can
                        negotiate an orderly leadership status for <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >USICA</gloss> when that is important. I think it is important in the

                        who have such abundance of money that it skews what would ordinarily be an

                        which are sponsored by <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, is that they
                        will use selection criteria more nearly like those used in private academic

                    </list>
                    <p>Following are the items in our notes of the July 16 meeting.</p>
                    <p>—The Director said the rationale was fine.<note n="2" xml:id="d176fn2"
                            >Reference is presumably to the proposal attached to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHF_1">Schneidman</persName>’s July 13 memorandum to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> (see <ref
                                target="#d174">Document 174</ref>).</note> The first page was
                        particularly well stated, especially paragraph four.</p>
                    <p>—He said the themes are all right.</p>
                    <p>—He said we need a new term for cultural presentations because this term is
                        associated basically with what <persName corresp="#p_WP_1">Paul
                            Wheeler</persName>’s shop in <gloss target="#t_ECA_1">ECA</gloss> has
                        been doing.</p>
                    <p>—He stated he would add $500,000 to the $250,000 now available for art
                        exhibits. Augmentation of the performing arts budget will follow, pending
                        consultation with Congressional elements; in the interim spot increases to
                        take advantage of special opportunities as they arise are not precluded.</p>
                    <pb n="508" facs="0557" xml:id="pg_508"/>
                    <p>—Following the discussion on whether <gloss target="#t_PGME_1">PGM/E</gloss>
                        or <gloss target="#t_PGMD_1">PGM/D</gloss> handle the fine arts exhibits,
                        there was no decision made.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_PGM_1">PGM</gloss> is to immediately proceed to work out
                        the necessary arrangements for fine and performing arts with the
                        Endowments.</p>
                    <p>—It was determined that <gloss target="#t_PGMT_1">PGM/T</gloss> has some $2.7
                        million “to play with.” This is in addition to funds for prints and language
                        versions.</p>
                    <p>—Deputy Director <persName corresp="#p_BCW_1">Bray</persName> suggested that
                        we do four issues of the magazine in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1980
                        and instead of deciding now to follow this with 12 in 1981 we test the water
                        for <gloss target="#t_PBS_1">PBS</gloss> acquisitions in our 1980 efforts.
                        At the end of that period we will decide whether to do the 12 magazine films
                        in 1981 or switch to straight acquisitions. The Director approved this but
                        only on a basis of one (production) to three (acquisitions) in these four
                        films. The Director was very specific in placing responsibility for the
                        concept for these films on <persName corresp="#p_SHF_1"
                            >Schneidman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WG_1"
                            >Winkler</persName> and asked that he be kept apprised of these
                        concepts.</p>
                    <p>—After being assured that the Ahora series was well placed in prime time, the
                        Director ordered that we proceed with the series.</p>
                    <p>—The Director urged caution in proceeding with the Mideast and African series
                        and said we will not go ahead without a “guarantee” of prime time placement.
                        This means that we will produce a pilot for Africa to test the waters there.
                        We are to call a hiatus on the Mideast series after completion of the third
                        film (now in process) pending guarantees from that region regarding prime
                        time placement.</p>
                    <p>—The contacts by the <gloss target="#t_PGM_1">PGM</gloss> front office with
                        the two National Endowments re rights to films they support should be in
                        consort with the legal counsel.</p>
                    <p>—We should attempt to acquire six to ten <gloss target="#t_PBS_1">PBS</gloss>
                        programs on the arts in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1980. The
                        Director specifically ordered the <gloss target="#t_PGM_1">PGM</gloss> front
                        office personally to undertake these negotiations.</p>
                    <p>—The Director approved proceeding in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1981
                        with the expenditure of $125,000 to acquire direct showing rights for 25
                        feature films but <hi rend="italic">only</hi> if these titles are selected
                        by the National Endowment for the Arts. He was very specific that they
                        should not be selected by Agency personnel.</p>
                    <p>—The Director approved the paper shows project as described in the
                        report.</p>
                    <p>—As far as the presentation on the corporate connection is concerned, he
                        specifically picked the option for individual corporate contacts and
                        negotiation. He said that the <gloss target="#t_PGM_1">PGM</gloss> front
                        office should be the implementers.</p>
                    <p>—The Director ordered completion of two papers which he wants by July 26.</p>
                    <pb n="509" facs="0558" xml:id="pg_509"/>
                    <p>1. A short paper for internal guidance of the Agency which rationalizes what
                        we plan to do.<note n="3" xml:id="d176fn3">Not found.</note> It should say
                        what we are now doing plus all the things that we plan to do. This covers
                        the notion that the posts know the problems and opportunities but cannot
                        know what is available in this rich and active segment of our society. We
                        should state our position on reverse flow. We should also describe the
                        powerful potential of a coordinated multi-media effort, in complementing the
                        on the ground offerings of art and artists. The American Participants should
                        be rationalized into this. In other words, he wants an explanation of how
                        they will work in support of the overall arts effort. He also wants in this
                        a rationalization of American cultural specialists similar to <gloss
                            target="#t_Amparts_1">Amparts</gloss> being placed under <gloss
                            target="#t_PGM_1">PGM</gloss>. He also noted that one very carefully
                        drafted section will have to describe how <gloss target="#t_PGM_1"
                            >PGM</gloss> will be responsible for planning of the total cultural
                        presentations’ efforts which will then be implemented by an office of <gloss

                    <p>2. The Director asked for a <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> letter which
                        will do much the same as the paper described above and will ask for <gloss
                            target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> input.<note n="4" xml:id="d176fn4">The

                        for a rationalization of how this whole program fits as part of a Program

                        in the Country Plans. Obviously a point to be handled here is the fact that
                        not all Country Plans ask for high art.<note n="5" xml:id="d176fn5">Below

                        cultural initiative:</p>
                    <p>1. The rationale and communication themes presented in your July 13
                        memorandum are approved.</p>
                    <p>2. The general thrust of cultural presentations and fine arts exhibits
                        presented in your July 13 memorandum is approved, with the following
                        understandings:</p>
                    <p>a. <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> cultural presentations and fine
                        arts exhibits will be based on recommendations made by the two National
                        Endowments, in keeping with our agreement of last October.<note n="3"

                        that <gloss target="#t_PGM_1">PGM</gloss> leadership is directly responsible
                        for undertaking negotiations to take maximum advantage of acquisitions in
                        this area. You should keep me regularly informed of your efforts and
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>4. The paper shows project is approved as outlined in your July 13
                        memorandum.</p>
                    <p>5. Your proposal for a new magazine as presented in your July 26 memorandum
                        (copy attached)<note n="6" xml:id="d177fn6">Not attached.</note> is
                        approved, with the following understandings:</p>
                    <p>a. For obvious reasons, the manner in which this decision is communicated to
                        the Agency and the field can impact heavily on its acceptance. I would,
                        therefore, like for you to develop for my approval a recommended approach
                        for making this decision known. I would like your recommendation no later
                        than Thursday, August 2. No communication of this decision should be made
                        until we have agreed on how it is to be handled.</p>
                    <p>b. There is a predisposition in this decision <hi rend="italic">against</hi>
                        permitting local inserts in the new magazine, for the quality reasons we
                        have discussed. Our communication of the decision should make this known,
                        but should also permit posts to state their case for a local insert, if they
                        wish. Local inserts may be permitted where persuasive cases are made.</p>
                    <p>c. I would like to know as soon as possible, but no later than August 31, the
                        detailed plan for phasing in the new magazine.</p>
                    <p>d. I will want to review and approve the design and format of the new
                        magazine (or alternative designs and formats) as these are developed.</p>
                    <p>6. <gloss target="#t_PGM_1">PGM</gloss> leadership is responsible for the
                        Agency’s efforts to secure private-sector funds to support this initiative.
                        I shall want to know specifically how and when you intend to proceed in this
                        area and to be kept apprised of your progress.</p>
                    <p>7. <gloss target="#t_PGM_1">PGM</gloss> leadership is responsible for
                        planning and coordinating the cultural initiative Agency-wide. If and when
                        irreconcilable differences <pb n="512" facs="0561" xml:id="pg_512"/>arise
                        across Agency element lines, these should be surfaced to the Deputy Director
                        or me for resolution.</p>
                    <p>8. This initiative should be undertaken immediately. Its impact must be felt
                        in fiscal year 1980.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I want to compliment you on your highly professional work on this
                        initiative over the past several weeks. Against an exceptionally tight
                        deadline, you have done work that should serve as a model for you and other
                        elements of the Agency. I appreciate your efforts, and I hope that you will
                        convey my appreciation to all those who have been involved. I shall, of
                        course, be delighted to answer any questions you may have.</p>

                        <salute>Dear <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>As you know, we have been wrestling for some time now with the question of
                        how best to organize the Agency to take maximum advantage of the powerful
                        communication potential of the arts.</p>
                    <p>Our point of departure has been a careful analysis of this year’s Country
                        Plan submissions, so that we would know the communication needs and
                        potential that you have identified in this area. We have had thorough,
                        wide-ranging discussions with all elements of the Agency on this subject.
                        And I have been persuaded, as a result of this process, that the
                        justification for more systematic, better coordinated and better organized
                        programs on the arts in America is indeed compelling.</p>
                    <p>Most of us have known, intuitively at least, that the arts are powerful
                        communicators, that they effectively transcend their own content to
                        interpret and enlighten the society that creates and nurtures them. The
                        Bicentennial exhibit “200 Years of American Art,” the <persName

                            Rosen.</note> the performance of <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Alvin
                            Ailey</persName> in a West African country, or of Romania’s Bulandra
                        Theater in the United States, all contain this potential.</p>
                    <p>Yet as an Agency, we have not realized the full potential of the arts as a
                        form of communication. We have tended to deal with the arts episodically. In
                        an effort to organize ourselves to communicate more effectively through the
                        arts, I am therefore designating “Arts America” as a major new
                        multi-regional initiative for the Agency. (The term “arts” as I shall use it
                        throughout this letter is broadly conceived; it denotes all forms of
                        creative expression that mirror the significant threads of a culture and its
                        values.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Rationale</p>
                    <p>A careful reading of the Country Plans indicates that too many influential
                        people abroad are ignorant of—or indifferent to—the richness and diversity
                        of the arts in America. Those of you who may have recently been in the
                        United States have probably been discouraged by the same ignorance or
                        indifference of Americans toward the artistic richness of the country where
                        you serve.</p>
                    <p>The framework of communication between the United States and other societies
                        is too often defined by a foreign perception of the United States as
                        materialistic and technological and by an American perception of our
                        interests in Eastern Europe, for example, as limited to the political, or
                        our interests in the Third World as limited to the economic. To the extent
                        that the fabric of communication between this society and others is defined
                        by such perceptions, the problem for us is fundamental. We are faced with a
                        distorted context for international communication in a world of inevitable
                        and increasingly difficult political and economic conflicts. In the
                        particular case of the United States, the national goals of peace and a
                        fuller life for all must be perceived as having a human face, and the nation
                        must be seen as capable of understanding and appreciating the cultures of
                        others as it seeks in turn to gain their understanding and participation in
                        pursuit of its goals. The arts offer proof that we are a vital, free, and
                        questioning people engaged in the search for improvement in man’s nature as
                        well as his condition. They are witness to the United States as a society
                        deserving respect and, more importantly, trust.</p>
                    <p>The arts address directly the limited perceptions and misperceptions we and
                        other societies have of each other. With the simplicity and integrity born
                        of the fact that they constitute a society’s vision <hi rend="italic"
                            >of</hi> itself <hi rend="italic">for</hi> itself, they are a form of
                        communication that arises from the <pb n="514" facs="0563" xml:id="pg_514"
                        />experience of a common humanity and identity of interests, which occurs in
                        the sharing of an artistic experience. They are the “human face” of a
                        nation. Whatever the specific bilateral political, military, or economic
                        tensions and concerns between the United States and any other country,
                        cultural communication among peoples is essential in achieving the goals of
                        this nation and this Agency.</p>
                    <p>Therein lies the reason that I have decided to devote special attention to
                        coordinated arts programs.</p>
                    <p>I continue to believe that the officer in the field—through the Country Plan
                        process—is in the best position to describe issues and prescribe strategies
                        for dealing with the bilateral tensions that motivate the major portion of
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> programs. He or she is also the
                        most qualified to analyze the particular form that the misperceptions I have
                        mentioned take in a society and to describe the nature of the constraints
                        that they place upon the bilateral communication relationship.</p>
                    <p>We might well agree that the arts treat these underlying concerns very
                        effectively. But the fact is that the field officer is not able to keep up
                        with the vast and rapidly changing cornucopia of American artistic
                        creativity. For this we will turn to the artists, performers, critics, and
                        scholars of art and society themselves.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Plan</p>
                    <p>“Arts America” is based on three key concepts:</p>
                    <p>1. Our approach will be two-tier: coordinated print, radio, and film products
                        collectively will provide a basic context for on-the-ground performances,
                        exhibitions and speakers. The essence of “what’s new” in the Agency’s
                        engagement with culture is that for the first time all of the Agency’s media
                        will be conceived and produced in parallel, to reinforce each other and the
                        in-person events.</p>
                    <p>The importance of the in-person event is in no way lessened, but we obviously
                        cannot send the New York City Ballet to very many countries. We can, through
                        our media products, provide a continuous and integrated explanation of this
                        ballet and all of the other arts events of this society.</p>
                    <p>2. We will not depend on the tastes and predilections of Agency employees,
                        however well-informed, to determine <hi rend="italic">which</hi> artists,
                        performing groups, critics, specialists in the arts, or films we sponsor
                        through our grants or our media products. Rather, the Agency will define the
                            <hi rend="italic">requirements and priorities</hi> of “Arts America.” We
                        will work through the National Endowment for the Arts and the National
                        Endowment for the Humanities to determine who or what best responds to those
                        requirements. We will make final selections from the Endowments’
                        recommendations, basing our decisions on budgetary and scheduling
                        considerations. This principle encompasses all forms of <pb n="515"
                            facs="0564" xml:id="pg_515"/>programs—performing artists, feature films,
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts, American Participants,
                        Cultural Specialists, fine arts exhibitions, and so forth.</p>
                    <p>3. Finally, a word about the audience that we envision for “Arts America.” We
                        are not limiting or even directing this effort primarily to the museum
                        directors or cultural czars of the world, as we have done too often in the
                        past. To the degree that we meet professional standards of excellence and
                        innovation, arts professionals will certainly be interested and involved.
                        But we are working on the assumption that the world’s busiest and most
                        important people are increasingly turning to the arts for intellectual
                        nourishment and for gaining a broader understanding of societies. Arts
                        America is designed to engage those people—in government, the media,
                        academe, the arts—whom you have identified as central to the bilateral
                        communication relationship. We are not setting out to have artists talk
                        about art with other artists, although that will surely happen. We <hi
                            rend="italic">are</hi> setting out to engage the most important people
                        with whom we deal in a dialogue about the deepest values and hopes of our
                        societies through the arts.</p>
                    <p>The major <hi rend="italic">new</hi> resources to be made available for Arts
                        America are three media products: (a) a quarterly publication; (b) a series
                        of half-hour film documentaries for television placement as well as for
                        direct projection; and (c) a series on the Voice of America.</p>
                    <p>Each of these products will have three principal functions, all related to
                        how America sees itself through the arts: to serve as showcase and
                        explicator of the arts in America, to mirror American society as seen
                        through the arts, and to correct false stereotypes about American culture.
                        Each one will be named “Arts America” to symbolize our determination that
                        our products be carefully coordinated in the planning stages and mutually
                        reinforcing when they reach you in the field. They will all be made
                        available worldwide. Specific details about production schedules, language
                        versions, and area-specific focusing will be the subject of future
                        communications.</p>
                    <p>Arts America will be implemented at a second level through coordination and,
                        in some cases, adaptation of existing products and programs. The <gloss
                            target="#t_WirelessFile_1">Wireless File</gloss> will carry a periodic
                        column of cultural briefs, similar to its economic and energy briefs. The
                        Article Alert Service and Availability List will significantly increase
                        their “cultural” fare. <gloss target="#t_PGMT_1">PGM/T</gloss> will greatly
                        step up its acquisition efforts relating to feature films, videotapes and
                        documentaries, including <gloss target="#t_PBS_1">PBS</gloss> documentaries
                        for television rebroadcast, to support Arts America. All of these acquired
                        films and videotapes will be made available to all posts. <gloss
                            target="#t_PGME_1">PGM/E</gloss> will produce additional printed
                        exhibits on art, with the intention of giving a sense of national style to
                        our centers and offices.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PGM_1">PGM</gloss>, in consultation with <gloss
                            target="#t_ECA_1">ECA</gloss> and the Area offices, will draw up for the
                        Endowments a worldwide schedule of Agency priorities for <pb n="516"
                            facs="0565" xml:id="pg_516"/>fine arts exhibitions and performing
                        artists. Subject to appropriate <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> and
                        Congressional reviews, I am augmenting—through reprogramming—the amount that
                        the Agency spends on fine arts exhibitions and the performing arts.</p>
                    <p>These initiatives will be designed and implemented in the context of existing
                        programs that foster communication through the arts—including those that
                        encourage communication on the arts of other societies. Foreign Press Center
                        tours and briefings contribute significantly to an understanding of the role
                        of the arts in American society. Multi-regional <gloss target="#t_IV_1"
                            >IV</gloss> programs and Agency grants to private sector organizations
                        have great potential for further expanding dialogue on the role of the arts
                        in all societies. Educational exchange programs contribute to communication
                        through the arts as an academic discipline. American Participants and
                        Cultural Specialists will be an integral part of this initiative. For
                        example, an artist, critic, or scholar will accompany or follow every
                        exhibition that we send abroad to provide context, start the dialogue, plant
                        the seed of institutional linkage.</p>
                    <p>In short, our long-term goal, through cooperation with the Endowments and the
                        private sector, is to provide the opportunity for communication through and
                        about the arts as a major element of the communication process between the
                        United States and other countries. I repeat that the goal is <hi
                            rend="italic">communication</hi>. We intend to send performing artists
                        and other leading American cultural figures to all parts of the world, and
                        to allow you the scheduling flexibility to ensure that they are available
                        when and where you want them, and that they can spend the time to meet the
                        appropriate people and conduct the workshops that contribute importantly to
                        the communication process. This will necessitate an attitudinal change for
                        many in the Agency. I am not opposed to the “big event”; but exchange,
                        linkage, and communication are also well served, often more economically, by
                        individuals and small groups.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Procedure</p>
                    <p>The process for implementing the arts initiative will parallel in many ways
                        the Program Design process through which Washington organizes itself to
                        respond to your Country Plan submissions. <gloss target="#t_PGM_1"
                            >PGM</gloss>, as the Agency’s central planning element, is responsible
                        for the preparation of a Program Design to which all Agency elements and the
                        Endowments can respond. <gloss target="#t_PGM_1">PGM</gloss> is also
                        responsible for coordinating the implementation of this Design Agency-wide.
                        The Design will be informed—as have all of our discussions and decisions up
                        to this point—by the arts <gloss target="#t_PPP_1">PPPs</gloss> that you
                        have submitted in your Country Plans. However, because of the field’s
                        understandable handicap in knowing what is available that best communicates
                        about and through the arts, and <pb n="517" facs="0566" xml:id="pg_517"
                        />because of the vital contribution to be made by the Endowments and the
                        private sector, the Program Design will not be limited to the specific
                        fulfillment of those <gloss target="#t_PPP_1">PPPs</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Thus, by October 1 you will receive a Program Design, listing the programs
                        and products the Agency is committed to providing in <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                            >FY</gloss>–80. You will be asked to order those that make the most
                        sense in your specific bilateral communication environment, in the context
                        of your communication objectives and plans. In upcoming years, we may find
                        it useful to request you to include more specific information about the
                        bilateral <hi rend="italic">cultural</hi> relationship in the narrative
                        analysis that is the key to your Country Plan.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Private Sector Support for Arts America</p>
                    <p>This letter would not be complete without a very brief reference to the
                        discussions that are going on here to inform the private sector about our
                        plans for Arts America and to elicit its support. We clearly have much to
                        gain and much to give in this area. In fact, it is only with private sector
                        support that we can move much beyond our media efforts to a truly
                        comprehensive exchange of artists, performing arts groups, and larger
                        events. We are exploring such approaches as challenge grants for larger,
                        more expensive performing arts groups, expanded assistance to private
                        organizations engaged in communicating on the arts of all societies,
                        artist-in-residence programs sponsored and funded by major corporations and
                        administered by <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>, and assistance
                        programs in transportation, printing, or representation for major events. We
                        will keep you informed of our progress in this area. We welcome your
                        thoughts and suggestions on which corporations, if any, in your country
                        might profitably be approached and what kinds of cultural activities they
                        are most likely to be interested in supporting.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Reverse Flow</p>
                    <p>Finally, a word about our “other” Presidential mandate—to enhance the access
                        of Americans to the cultures of other peoples. This is an area of concern to
                        the Agency, particularly given the potential demand on the Agency as we
                        begin a more serious and concerted effort to present American arts
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>I begin with two assumptions: (1) that the widest possible exchange of art,
                        artists and artifacts among nations is consistent with our mandate and
                        should be encouraged by this Agency in the most efficient way possible; and
                        (2) that this does not and cannot mean direct financial support to foreign
                        exhibitions and performances in the United States. Our role in this area is
                        analogous to our role in English teaching: our scarce resources can best
                        serve as catalyst, identifier, facilitator of institutional linkages through
                        programs alluded to elsewhere in this letter; we simply cannot mount a major
                        program to finance the “reverse <pb n="518" facs="0567" xml:id="pg_518"
                        />flow.” We can and will assist private organizations in attaining this
                        worthy goal.</p>
                    <p>The best course, I believe, lies in working with the two organizations that
                        have an existing relationship with the arts activities of private
                        corporations, foundations, universities, state art councils, community
                        organizations, museums, and the artists themselves—the Endowments. <gloss
                            target="#t_PGM_1">PGM</gloss> has been charged with the responsibility
                        of working out the details of a facilitative support arrangement with the
                        Endowments and will let you know what is required of field posts.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I want to emphasize that everything I have outlined here relates
                        solely to how we will communicate on and through the arts. This is one of
                        our most significant responsibilities. It is not, however, our only
                        responsibility. It should go without saying that you must continue to
                        communicate fully about important American policies and bilateral concerns.
                        Your obligation to fulfill your communication plans as outlined in your
                        approved Country Plan remains undiluted.</p>
                    <p>I have come to the end of this admittedly lengthy letter. It is, however,
                        only the beginning of what I believe may well become one of the most
                        important contributions this Agency can make in the field of international
                        communication—harnessing the potential of the arts for international
                        understanding. I look forward to hearing your thoughts about what we should
                        be doing in this most important field.</p>

                    <p>You will recall that we directed <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> to
                        re-examine its language priorities and readjust its output to support basic
                        U.S. foreign policy objectives a few months ago. <persName

                        things stand. Persian-language broadcasts were resumed in April and now go

                        There is not much evidence of impact yet in either Iran or Afghanistan. An
                        additional hour of Persian will be added this winter. In addition,
                        additional resources are being allocated to Chinese-language broadcasting
                        and an hour of English to the Caribbean is being added during <gloss

                    <p>Next priority is Azeri, but it is being put off until 1981 because of
                        budgetary stringency. Cost of adding Azeri (with impact in both Iran and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>) is $250,000 per year and 8
                        slots. <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> says it cannot reprogram during
                            <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1980 to do this. (C)</p>
                    <p>In light of what we know the Soviets are doing in the area immediately to the

                        very leisurely way. If all we need is $250,000 to start Azeri, it seems to
                        me it would be very much in our national interest to do it. We also need to
                        push <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> into doing something about

                    <p>I have attended meetings of both the <gloss target="#t_BIB_1">BIB</gloss> and
                        the <gloss target="#t_RFERL_1">RFE/RL</gloss> Corporate Board this week,
                        talked to both about our priorities and policy goals as they relate to the
                        radios, about some of the challenges we anticipate in the 1980’s and what we
                        want to see the radios do to be in the best possible shape to meet them. I
                        also answered questions of board members at some length. I have received
                        warm thanks from everyone except the <gloss target="#t_BIB_1">BIB</gloss>
                        Staff for coming and talking. (U)</p>
                    <p>The contrast between these two boards is striking when one experiences them
                        in succession. The <gloss target="#t_BIB_1">BIB</gloss> and its staff leave
                        one with the feeling that here is a randomly selected group of people who
                        really have very little concept of what they are doing, preoccupied with
                        trying to interfere in the management of the radios and magnifying petty
                        problems into large issues. Only <persName corresp="#p_GJA_1"
                            >Gronouski</persName> has vision and a concept of what intelligent
                        oversight is—and one feels sorry for him having to try to keep this motley
                        crew in line. The <gloss target="#t_RFERL_1">RFE/RL</gloss> Corporate Board,
                        on the other hand, is a group of talented, serious first-rate men,
                        experienced in business and public affairs, who know what the role of a
                        supervisory body should be. They know and understand far more about radio
                        operations than the <gloss target="#t_BIB_1">BIB</gloss> does and readily
                        understand the goals and purposes of the radios as important foreign policy
                        operational assets. (C)</p>
                    <p>It is more clear than ever that all of this hullabaloo about “relocation” of
                        the radios to the U.S. is an issue that has been blown out of all proportion
                        to its real importance by the <gloss target="#t_BIB_1">BIB</gloss> Staff in
                        conjunction with a few congressional staffers. The Corporate Board members,
                        to a man, understand this and are determined to keep the issue in
                        perspective. I stressed to them that they all have an important role to play
                        with Congress on this and other radio problems by helping build <pb n="522"
                            facs="0571" xml:id="pg_522"/>understanding and support of <gloss
                            target="#t_RFERL_1">RFE/RL</gloss>. This advice was seconded by
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJA_1">Gronouski</persName>. I hope that in this
                        way we have permanently scotched <gloss target="#t_BIB_1">BIB</gloss> staff
                        efforts to monopolize congressional relations and prevent radio management
                        from participating in the process. (C)</p>
                    <p>All these people are well aware of the radios’ need for more money. They are
                        already operating with such efficiency that modest increases in budget can
                        buy heightened impact more cheaply than it could be obtained in any other
                        way. They are mindful of the challenges they will face in a succession
                        situation in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and in Eastern
                        Europe, when leaderships change in the 1980’s, and they would like to have
                        their programming capabilities, their news-gathering and analytical staffs
                        and their technical facilities in optimum condition to meet them. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GJA_1">Gronouski</persName> has declared that the main
                        inhibition to accomplishing this is <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss>’s
                        restrictive attitude. They are getting talk from <gloss target="#t_OMB_1"
                            >OMB</gloss> about cutting the radios’ budget for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1981 back below the <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1980 level! This is idiotic. But it will be hard to deal
                        with if the President endorses it. <persName corresp="#p_GJA_1"
                            >Gronouski</persName> and I both need some estimate from you on how far
                        you are willing to go to oppose this. We can then devise a strategy for

                        and talents as the <gloss target="#t_RFERL_1">RFE/RL</gloss> corporate board

                        however. I have the feeling we will need to make a real push on this no
                        later than the end of September. If you wish to take it up directly with the
                        President, I will prepare arguments for you. This may be better than taking
                        it up with <persName corresp="#p_MJT_1">McIntyre</persName>—on the other

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">INTRODUCTION</p>
                    <p>Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1977 created the U.S. International
                        Communication Agency (<gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>, or simply
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>) as of April 1, 1978. It combined
                        the programs of the “old” U.S. Information Agency (<gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>) <pb n="524" facs="0573" xml:id="pg_524"/>and those of the
                        “old” Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (<gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss>) until then a part of the Department of State. The new
                        Agency therefore embraced the full panoply of international education and
                        cultural exchange, international broadcasting (Voice of America), and media
                        programs (American publications, exhibits, films and television prepared
                        especially for use in the Agency’s activities abroad) of those two former
                        organizations.</p>
                    <p>Significantly, whereas the major mission of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> had been to tell the outside world about America and its
                        potential, the new Agency was now charged with a “second mandate”—to inform
                        Americans also about other peoples and other cultures.</p>
                    <p>In view of the reorganization and this added dimension, it seemed worthwhile
                        to take a broad look at <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>, as it
                        completed its first year of operation, with the goal of identifying some of
                        the significant issues confronting it. This study is a part of the
                        continuing work of the General Accounting Office (<gloss target="#t_GAO_1"
                            >GAO</gloss>) in the field of public diplomacy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">SCOPE OF WORK</p>
                    <p>This study deals in some detail with seven issues on which we have developed
                        sufficient information to sustain a significant presentation. These analyses
                        include backgrounds, current problems, and occasional suggestions for
                        improvements, as reflected in several scores of interviews with individuals
                        and/or groups, inside and outside the Agency, who follow seriously its
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that important issues confronting the Agency are not limited to
                        these seven. Others may merit equal attention. To that extent, choice of
                        those to be discussed in this study might be said to be arbitrary.</p>
                    <p>Profiting by the presence of a <gloss target="#t_GAO_1">GAO</gloss>
                        consultant with long experience in the programs in question, we held
                        discussions with Agency personnel and, to a limited extent, with officers
                        abroad. We also reviewed current public sources of information, such as the
                        substantial record of Congressional hearings compiled during intensive study
                        of the reorganization proposals; however, interviews were indeed the
                        principal source of the information used in preparing this study.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">SUMMARY</p>
                    <p>The study is divided into seven sections, the titles of which define pretty
                        much the content; they might be delineated as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Search for Recognition</hi>—For both foreign audiences
                        and American public there is a vague uncertainty about who the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> is (its identification) and where it fits
                        (its identity).</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Second Mandate</hi>—For the first time in the
                        history of public diplomacy, the Agency is being asked to assist the
                        American people <pb n="525" facs="0574" xml:id="pg_525"/>in learning about
                        foreign nations, as well as the contrary. This raises old questions and new,
                        legal and otherwise.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Coordination</hi>—There is a double coordination problem
                        for <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>—the effective organization and
                        operation of the Agency itself, and the execution of the Presidential
                        directive that <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> coordinate all programs
                        conducted by the U.S. Government in the field of public diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Washington vs. the Field</hi>—There is chronic rivalry
                        between supporting elements in Washington and “front-line” elements in the
                        field, and, in parallel fashion, between the Agency’s media services and the
                        area offices—not entirely without benefit to the program as a whole.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">New Problem in Overseas Assignments</hi>—A new problem
                        that would seem to be important enough to justify that one sally into the
                        personnel field: how does one direct a foreign service in which a growing
                        number of career officers no longer wish to serve abroad?</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">New Programs at the Price of Old</hi>—Mining programs of
                        proven worth to create or increase programs of hopeful worth needs careful
                        assessment based on a long look back.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">The Maintenance of Quality in Exchanges</hi>—Less
                        intense as a problem for the new Agency than at first feared, maintaining
                        the high calibre of official exchanges remain nonetheless a constant and
                        justified preoccupation.</p>
                    <p>Appendix 1 contains charts indicating trends in appropriations for the
                        programs covering the past twenty years.<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2"

                    </p>
                    <p>As the new executive body combining the U.S. Information Agency and the
                        Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs came into being, there was an
                        unprecedented effort to convey through a carefully chosen title something of
                        what the new organization was intended to be. This led to more attention, on
                        the part of the Congress and the press, than a mere change of name would
                        ordinarily have provoked. Along with it came a reassessment of the position
                        in Government that the new agency should occupy—a much more profound
                        question. This chapter will analyze the background to the discussion and the
                        current standing of the new Agency as it tries to execute its mandate.</p>
                    <p>The connotations which usage lends to certain terms rub off on other terms
                        around them. Thus “information”, a quite acceptable, respectable word if
                        left alone, assumed a certain connotation because <pb n="526" facs="0575"
                            xml:id="pg_526"/>it had appeared in the title of the two patently
                        propaganda agencies at the very beginning of American public diplomacy—the
                        Committee on Public Information, of World War I, and the Office of War
                        Information, of World War II. No amount of subsequent defining has freed it
                        entirely in the public mind from those initial associations, even though the
                        names themselves are no longer a part of the public vocabulary. Further, the
                        word “information”, as some foreigners use it, has overtones of
                        intelligence-gathering—a fact they cannot always fully forget when they hear
                        the term in connection with the American public diplomacy program. Yet of
                        the dozen and a half titles applied to the successive main official overseas
                        programs since the original “Creel Committee” (the Committee on Public
                        Information cited above), ten have included this ambiguous word.<note n="3"

                            organizers were brought back and back to a limited terminology to

                            Coordinator on Inter-American Affairs (1938), and finally to become the
                            Office of Inter-American Affairs; the Coordinator of Information (1941),
                            including the Foreign Information Service, the parallel Office of Facts
                            and Figures (also of 1941); the Voice of America (1942); the Office of

                            Agency (1953); and the International Communication Agency (1978). And
                            this list does not include the parallel title, the U.S. Information
                            Service (<gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>), applied to the field
                            (overseas) operations of the public diplomacy programs from the
                            liberation of Europe until the abolishment of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss>. Thus the term of ambiguity over all those years has
                            been in a sense the very term representing continuity. [Footnote is in

                    <p>Most experienced public diplomacy officers would probably agree that
                        “information” has over the years complicated their information task,
                        arousing at times vague suspicions and eroding in various degrees their
                        credibility among those to whom they address their program. But most would
                        no doubt also agree that foreign audiences, after hearing the term ever
                        since Liberation, had largely made their peace with it—they came to know
                        what it is by seeing what it does.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">ANOTHER NEW NAME</p>
                    <p>Then came the reorganization of 1978, erasing <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> (the overall designation) and, generally, <gloss

                        this latter acronym alive here and there), and creating the U.S.
                        International Communication Agency. In the opinion of some senior officers
                        and <pb n="527" facs="0576" xml:id="pg_527"/>observers, the Agency found
                        itself set back in its concern with identification, forced all over again to
                        win confidence for its title. This time too the task is complicated by a
                        slightly ambiguous term: “communication” (singular) tends in certain minds
                        to have technical, rather than social, implications.</p>
                    <p>There has apparently been little controversy over the name in the history of
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>’s predecessors. <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> as a title had appeared out of World War
                        II, adopted in country after country as liberation progressed. And
                        successive titles for the Washington-based side of the organization were
                        adopted mainly to indicate changes in structure, not to reflect any deep
                        feeling about general connotations. Even the separation of information and
                        exchange programs in 1953 passed without much discussion of name; each side
                        simply designated in the title the part of the program that was largely left
                        to it—the U.S. Information Agency on the one hand, and the Bureau of
                        Educational and Cultural Affairs, Department of State, on the other.</p>
                    <p>Title was given greater consideration as Reorganization Plan No. 2 came up in
                        1977. Policy leaders in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> hoped that a
                        fresh name would reflect changes in emphasis in the new organization, and
                        especially the accent on “mutuality” of which everyone at the time was
                        talking. They came up with “Agency for International Communication,” a title
                        that at least evoked purpose, even if it did not go far to define that
                        purpose. Later compromises brought it to the present International
                        Communication Agency, with the ambiguity cited above.</p>
                    <p>Five Public Affairs Officers (<gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>) in
                        Western Europe were consulted during the review concerning this matter of
                        title and its effect on their work. They take it quite seriously,
                        recognizing the validity of the statement in the January 1973 report of the
                        U.S. Advisory Commission on Information:</p>

                                identification of the “old Agency”: “The American experience of more

                        the importance of the current change of name.</p>

                    <p>One of them regretted particularly that all the rhetoric expended in the
                        discussion had created expectations of program and support that will be very
                        difficult to realize. He echoed a senior officer in <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >USICA</gloss> Washington who speaks of the “over-selling of the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>.” He believes that the change of name is
                        indeed a complication, one that the communication effort could have done
                        without, and therefore he is not insisting on its use among his clients;
                        they come from a people conservative in such matters, and he believes they
                        will continue for a long time to refer to the organization as “<gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>”.</p>
                    <p>Two of his colleagues react similarly. “The name is a recognition problem,”
                        said one. “<gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> has not become an
                        identifying term and will not do so.”</p>
                    <p>The other two <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s feel less strongly about
                        the matter. One of them admitted that “the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                            >CIA</gloss> connotation is there”; but he believed that time was
                        already starting to take care of the initial confusion and doubt.</p>
                    <p>As for the fifth officer, he considered the question of title “not very
                        important; the change represents only a temporary complication.”</p>
                    <p>In practical terms, the discussion is now moot—the Agency’s letterhead has
                        been changed worldwide, and for the foreseeable future, <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> it is.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">NEW STATEMENT OF MISSION</p>
                    <p>There is significant improvement, however, in one aspect of identification:
                        the Presidential mandate of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> is more
                        specific than most of those preceding it, so that it serves, in some part at
                        least, as guide to officers charged with carrying out programs and as
                        definition to those interested in <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>
                        programs. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s
                        statement of March 13, 1978,<note n="6" xml:id="d181fn6">See <ref
                                target="#d121">Document 121</ref>.</note> called for “the broadest
                        possible exchange of people and ideas”, the encouragement of private
                        institutions “to develop their own forms of exchange,” “sufficient
                        information * * * to give foreign peoples the best possible understanding of
                        our policies and our intentions,” help “to insure that our government
                        adequately understands foreign public opinion and culture” and assistance to
                        individual Americans and institutions in “learning about other nations and
                        their cultures,” “the maximum flow of information and ideas among the
                        peoples of the world,” and “negotiations on cultural exchanges with other
                        governments.” Foreign policy guidance is to come from the Secretary of
                        State. Both the exchange program and the Voice of America are to be
                        protected in the proper execution of their respective functions, and the
                        Agency <pb n="529" facs="0578" xml:id="pg_529"/>“will undertake no
                        activities which are covert, manipulative or propagandistic.”</p>
                    <p>Whether the gist of this slightly repetitive list can be grasped and retained
                        remains to be seen, since the text contains neither catchy phrase nor
                        inspirational expression, and the Agency’s title evokes so small a part of
                        it. “Communication” (singular) appears nowhere in the President’s March 13,
                        1978 memorandum to the Director of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>,
                        save in the Agency’s title. Reference to “international communications”
                        (plural) in paragraph numbered 4 does not seem to carry quite the same
                        connotation as the term in the title. Inside the Agency itself, the search
                        for a satisfying identification, as one long-time officer points out, is
                        shared by the players themselves: “When it comes to our own definition of
                        the <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>, we don’t agree!”</p>
                    <p>This latter remark leads one to believe there is a question not only of
                        identification—which may or may not turn out to be of much long-range
                        importance—but one also of identity. What is <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> and where does it fit? What does it mean to those who work
                        in it and for it?</p>

                    <p>For many, sense of identity is tied directly to the Agency’s relative
                        position in the national government. Does the Agency “count” in
                        international public affairs decisions of an Administration, or not? Here
                        the Director’s standing with the President becomes extremely important—if he
                        has direct access to the Chief Executive he can perform those aspects of his
                        job which require such access, and he enjoys the kind of support that aids
                        him in his leadership of the Agency. The last Advisory Commission for <gloss

                        seriously getting underway, felt so strongly on this point that for the
                        first time they recommended legislative steps that would “guarantee” high
                        status to the Agency:</p>

                        enviable position. Besides, his contribution to policy decisions, on the
                        basis of his knowledge of worldwide public opinion, can and should make for

                            >See <ref target="#d150">Document 150</ref>.</note> recognizes this; he
                        puts the perspective in two pointed sentences:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>“Neither <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> nor <gloss

                            in diplomacy, nor in some cases even as important contributors to
                            national goals. One effect of our perceived lack of relevance in the
                            past has been at least a mild case of institutional self-doubt.”</p>

                        Advisory Commission’s reports. Thus the 26th report (1973), carries this
                        statement of position:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>“* * * We reiterate our belief that the National Security Council
                            structure developed in recent years should include representation from
                            the government’s arm which specializes in foreign communication and in
                            understanding foreign public opinion * * *</p>
                        <p>“The importance of positioning the director of foreign communications at
                            the strategic levels of the government * * * is that this enables him to
                            be thoroughly familiar with Presidential initiatives and thinking in
                            foreign affairs.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>The Commission’s 27th Report stated that</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>“* * * the Commission believes that it is more important than ever for
                            the Agency to have greater access to the Secretary’s decision-making

                            will be more thoroughly informed on policy decisions and can better
                            present and interpret them to the world. Conversely, it can better
                            perceive and report back the impact of these policies on foreign public
                            opinion.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>And then comes the rather plaintive statement:</p>
                    <pb n="531" facs="0580" xml:id="pg_531"/>
                    <quote>
                        <p>“But unfortunately the Agency continues to remain a neglected resource
                            and only a potential contributor to the foreign and national
                            decision-making process.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>The 28th and final Advisory Commission’s report picks up this regretful tone
                        as it laments “* * * only a spotty record * * * in providing our Presidents
                        with information about foreign perceptions of the U.S.,” on the one side,

                        makes its own recommendation on this point: “This Commission, as its
                        predecessors, reiterates the need to have <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"

                    <p>Most of that conversation might be said still to be . . . anticipatory. More
                        than a year has passed since it took place, and one can find few initiated
                        individuals, inside or outside the Agency, who believe that the Agency’s
                        identity has been sharpened by either a contribution to the decisions of the

                        <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is the ongoing problem of identity of the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> in the eyes of the American public. At
                        first glance, one wonders how this can be a problem at all. Has not the
                        President, in his March 3, 1978 memorandum to the Director, reassured the
                        American people by his directive that “* * * the Agency will undertake no
                        activities which are covert, manipulative or propagandistic?”</p>
                    <p>One bears in mind, however, that, save for certain important parts of the
                        exchange of persons program, all apsects of the Agency’s activities are
                        addressed overseas. Indeed, by law<note n="16" xml:id="d181fn16">U.S.
                            Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, as amended, Title V,

                            original.]</note> they may not be presented to the American public.
                        There is therefore no very precise image conjured up among Americans when
                        the Agency’s name is heard, despite the good media coverage at the time of
                        the reorganization; for the average American, there is simply no experience
                        to which to tie it. For although Americans know such terms as the Voice of
                        America and the <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName> exchange
                        programs, they rarely associate these elements with the broader, overall
                        organization.</p>
                    <p>One of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>’s basic problems is therefore to
                        maintain its credentials at home as a responsible, experienced,
                        well-balanced agency with solid capabilities for doing overseas what it
                        claims it can do. In the absence of a broad domestic constituency,
                        “presenting its case” to the American public has not been easy. As a result,
                        says one of its ranking officers, “the Agency suffers from vague
                        identity.”</p>

                        <item>A Critical Question for the Research Mandate: Why Study the General
                            Public?</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The current review of the Research mandate has raised the basic question of
                        what “publics” should be studied. In view of the fundamental importance of
                        this question to the Agency’s mission as well as to the research function,
                        we have prepared a paper (attached) which details some of the theoretical,
                        historical, methodological and policy justifications for including the
                        general public in our examination of foreign attitudes.</p>
                    <p>With respect to countries where survey research is feasible, these arguments
                        basically are that:</p>
                    <p>—while scholarly opinions differ on the degree and the appropriateness of
                        general-public influence on policy, there is agreement that at a minimum the
                        general public sets the outer limits of government action and the
                        informed-attentive public (which we include under the rubric of general
                        public for survey purposes) helps to set the inner limits;</p>
                    <p>—the postwar history of the interrelationship between public opinion and
                        foreign policy indicates that leaders are increasingly attentive to general
                        public sentiments on major foreign policy questions and that segments of the
                        public have developed an impressive array of <pb n="536" facs="0585"
                            xml:id="pg_536"/>instruments for pressuring governments, often invoking
                            <hi rend="italic">vox populi</hi> as justification for their
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>—compared to those involving relatively small samples of the influential
                        publics (125–150 interviews), surveys of the general public (about 1,000
                        interviews) are statistically more reliable, facilitate cross-tabular and
                        multivariate analyses, and permit breakouts by sector (occupational,
                        political, demographic, education level, etc.); and</p>
                    <p>—in addition to the fact that the President has specifically charged the
                        Agency with assessing “public opinion abroad”,<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2"
                            >An unknown hand inserted “or foreign policy issue” after the word

                        <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> is presently the only
                        agency—government or private—to conduct such research on a systematic basis
                        and is thus in a position to make a unique contribution to the foreign
                        affairs community.</p>
                    <p>—research on the general public lies at the heart of the Agency’s “listening”
                        function and enhances <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>’s capability
                        for developing effective programs for two-way communication.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons, this office is firmly convinced that the Agency should
                        conduct research on “general public” as well as “influential public” opinion
                        abroad toward major foreign policy questions.</p>
                    <p>We are attempting to improve turnaround time for assessing the views of both
                        the “influential public” and the “general public”. On August 24, we proposed
                        a new approach to surveying the “influential public,” which the Acting
                        Director approved.<note n="3" xml:id="d182fn3">Not found.</note> In a
                        separate memorandum of today’s date,<note n="4" xml:id="d182fn4">Not
                            found.</note> we will propose a new pre-set mechanism, initially in
                        Western Europe and Japan, for surveying the general public.</p>
                    <p>Studying the general public, however, appears to be a more controversial
                        concept with Agency management than studying the influential public. As we
                        understand it, the principal arguments are that the general public has
                        negligible influence on foreign policy decisions of governments abroad and
                        that, in any case, Agency programming is directed toward influential
                        elites.</p>
                    <p>As discussed at greater length in the attached paper, we believe there are
                        very strong arguments for continuing research on the general public. This
                        question is so fundamental to research—and has such strong implications for
                        the Agency’s mission—that we believe it warrants the Director’s personal
                        attention.</p>

                        <p>The current discussion within <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> over
                            the selection of foreign publics to be sampled in opinion surveys poses
                            basic questions which require careful thought. Decisions related to the
                            selection of samples for study should be based upon consideration of
                            some of the theoretical, historical, methodological and policy
                            justifications for covering the general public in such surveys.</p>
                        <p>In setting forth these justifications, this paper focuses on public
                            opinion surveying in those countries where opinion polling is possible.
                            This does not mean to imply that public opinion in authoritarian states
                            cannot in some way affect government policies, nor that we should give
                            up efforts to ascertain such opinion through available means.</p>

                        <p>The whole question of the degree to which the average citizen in a
                            democratic society can and should influence government policy decisions
                            is, of course, a subject of timeless debate. An extensive literature
                            argues for maximum public participation in order to check tyranny,
                            inform leaders of the popular will and encourage individuals to exercise
                            civic responsibility. Many other writers warn that extensive public

                        <p>The degree to which publics in different cultures follow public affairs
                            varies dramatically. Almond and Verba demonstrated in the early 1960’s
                            that publics in Germany, the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> are far more attentive to public
                            policy than those in Mexico and Italy. In overall terms Rosenau
                            estimates this “attentive public” at no more than 10% of the population
                            and probably smaller.</p>
                        <p>Our findings would suggest that this is an accurate general estimate of
                            those who follow foreign affairs “very closely,” but an underestimation
                            of those who follow foreign affairs “fairly closely.” In a July survey

                            this group could not be classified as influential or elite, they do find
                            intellectual stimulation and satisfaction in matters pertaining to
                            foreign policy. As Rosenau points out, this group can be a critical
                            audience for opinion molders and a critical link in the chain of
                            communication to mass publics. Research on the general public is the
                            only way to identify this group and its attitudes.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s ability to conduct large-scale
                            maneuvers in Western Europe has been circumscribed by adverse public
                            reactions. Recent improvements in Japan’s Self-Defense Forces have been
                            greatly facilitated by increased public awareness and concern over
                            Soviet military expansion in the Far East. Regardless of what Western
                            leaders personally think about modernization of tactical nuclear forces
                            in Europe, it is predictable that their decisions will be influenced by
                            the views of the general public—just as public opinion affected their
                            decisions on the neutron bomb. Economic pressures emanating from the
                            public domain have just led Bonn to make the remarkable announcement
                            that the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> would be unable to meet
                            its <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> commitment to a 3-percent
                            real increase in its defense budget.</p>
                        <p>An argument which the Administration has made repeatedly in favor of
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is that surveys
                            demonstrate clear domestic public support for the Treaty. But a crucial
                            point in the debate has been the question of European support for the
                            Treaty. The Administration claims that the Allies solidly back the
                            agreement and points to the Guadeloupe Summit endorsement, while
                            opponents rejoin that the government has been arm-twisting our Allies
                            and that European officials concede in private their reservations.<note

                                >SALT</gloss> II as well as official Allied attitudes toward the
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>It seems evident, therefore, that the force of public opinion has
                            affected foreign policy in democracies with increasing intensity and <pb
                                n="542" facs="0591" xml:id="pg_542"/>frequency. There are many
                            reasons for this, not the least being the very existence of opinion
                            polls themselves. Mass communication has played a critical role as well
                            in focusing and informing public opinion.</p>
                        <p>In addition, practical experience and modern technology have given
                            publics an impressive array of instruments for making their views felt
                            beyond the traditional means of the ballot, lobbying, and political
                            party, pressure group and trade union membership. The modern repertoire
                            would have to include public interest pressure groups, computerized
                            letter-writing, demonstrations, marches, whistleblowing, freedom of
                            information legislation, and the use of powerful mass media.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, the current debate is not whether public opinion is affecting
                            policy but whether it is affecting it <hi rend="italic">too much</hi>.
                            The <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration has
                            frequently been criticized for basing its policies too much on opinion
                            poll results. But this criticism extends beyond the present government.
                            In his recent <hi rend="italic">Foreign Affairs</hi> article, former

                                still less with education. Their purpose, it seems, is to discover
                                what people want and fear and dislike, and then to identify
                                themselves with those sentiments.”</p>

                        <p>Most democratic governments abroad could be subject to similar criticism.

                            influence over positions taken by those governments—and have often been
                            cited by European officials as the reason for their inability to

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Methodological Justification</p>
                        <p>Methods for polling the general public are time-tested. Public opinion
                            surveying procedures have been tested and refined through over fifty
                            years of experience. They are widely used and accepted, and usually are
                            cost-effective compared to other methods of gauging public
                            sentiment.</p>
                        <p>In our separate memorandum on developing a more rapid and economical
                            method for surveying the influential public, we propose samples of
                            125–150 drawn from a pre-selected list of 1,000.<note n="22"

                            opinion, it has clear disadvantages when compared with the customary

                            general public surveying. In contrast to influential elite sampling,
                            full sampling of the general public will enable us to:</p>
                        <p>—obtain statistically more accurate and reliable figures;</p>
                        <p>—distinguish between different publics, such as the “foreign affairs

                        <p>—make distinctions between numerous other useful categories such as
                            occupation, age, political affiliation, education;</p>
                        <p>—carry out with a higher degree of confidence more sophisticated forms of

                        <p>—compare our findings with those generated by other researchers, the
                            great majority of whom base their work on general public samples.</p>
                        <p>The most effective methodological approach, and the one we strongly
                            prefer, is to sample <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the influential public
                            and the general public. This approach will give us a more complete
                            measurement of the climate of opinion and enable us to compare general
                            public and influential public views.</p>
                        <p>There is inevitably a certain arbitrariness about how one segments the

                        <p>As the Agency charged with assessing “the impact of actual and proposed
                            United States foreign policy decisions on public opinion abroad,” we
                            are, in any case, obligated to measure the opinions of foreign publics.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, in launching
                                <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>, announced that “the new Agency
                            for International Communication will help us demonstrate a decent
                            respect for the opinions of mankind. . . .”</p>
                        <p>In the absence of general public surveying by <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                                >USICA</gloss>, this information will not to our knowledge be
                            produced systematically by any other <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            Government agency. This is an area where this Agency can make a valuable
                            and unique contribution to policymakers’ understanding of the currents
                            of foreign opinion.</p>
                        <p>This information is also unavailable with any consistency from data
                            produced by others. In exercising their “watching brief,” Research
                            analysts already are attentive to survey results produced by others
                            which have a bearing on Agency concerns. Experience has demonstrated
                            clearly, however, that such information is fragmentary, sporadic and
                            often superficial. Only <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> research
                            is focused specifically and in-depth on <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> policy and Agency programming concerns.</p>
                        <p>It also seems axiomatic that, in order to communicate effectively, the
                            Agency must know the mindset of the general public on major issues of
                            concern to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. Although budgetary
                            considerations have forced the Agency to direct its activities primarily
                            to elite audience groups, several of these were selected because they
                            can serve as channels to the wider public.</p>
                        <p>Even if the Agency can speak only to a few, it should listen to the many.
                            It is only thereby that our program themes can properly relate to the
                            concerns, values and aspirations of the general public. Despite the
                            present emphasis on communicating with elites, many Agency programs
                                (<gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_TV_1"
                                >TV</gloss> placement, films) are aimed at the general public.
                            Research on general public attitudes is the backbone of the Agency’s
                            listening function and can be an important aid to developing effective
                            programs for two-way communication.</p>

                        activity indispensable to our overall efforts. As you know, my continuing,
                        detailed attention to this subject is born strictly of my conviction as to
                        the importance of research to this Agency and its responsibilities, and my
                        desire to see research perform to its full potential.</p>
                    <p>I am especially concerned that we not devote our limited staff and financial
                        resources to acquiring any but the most essential knowledge and
                        information.</p>
                    <p>Ours is a government-financed, practical research need. We will not be
                        satisfied with research results that are simply “interesting”; our research
                        findings must be “indispensable” for specified purposes and end-users. <hi

                        knowledge of:</p>

                        social and political processes are of interest to them; how accurate their
                        perceptions of U.S. society and policies are; what the important gaps are in
                        their knowledge of U.S. society and policies;</p>

                    <p>Of equal importance, it will inform this Agency’s communication efforts with
                        other societies. It will provide valid, useful direction to field personnel
                        and their support arms in Washington as to the important concerns,
                        attitudes, aspirations, perceptions and misperceptions of those with whom we
                        communicate overseas. This demands research activities which are pinpointed
                        to provide essential information on clearly identified problems of <hi
                            rend="italic">overriding</hi> concern.</p>
                    <p>Special note should be taken of the Office of Research’s responsibility in
                        meeting <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> research needs, which are
                        clearly encompassed by the three above-outlined areas of inquiry. We are
                        especially interested at this time in data which will aid <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> management in improving the quality of the
                        Voice’s “Americana” broadcasts. Better information is sought on aspects of
                        American life, thought and societal development that will both help
                        foreigners to acquire a more accurate understanding of important aspects of
                        American society and be of sufficient interest to them that they will
                        listen. (I emphasize that I envision far more combing of existing literature
                        and surveys in this effort than I do new work.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES</p>
                    <p>Three basic operational guidelines apply to all Agency research activity:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Secondary</hi> sources will play a preeminent role in
                        our efforts. They will be culled for relevant insights as the first and,
                        hopefully, principal source in any project. I expect that a major portion of
                        the kind of information we seek already exists in the literature and/or in
                        projects in progress under non-<gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>
                        auspices, both here and abroad. Therefore, a major source for the “product”
                        of the Office of Research will <pb n="547" facs="0596" xml:id="pg_547"/>be
                        the analysis and interpretation of relevant, extant data and literature. We
                        will purchase extant data, if necessary, rather than undertake to collect it
                        ourselves. Surveys and other contracts will be initiated only after we are
                        satisfied that data essential to our purposes do not already exist. Wherever
                        possible in such instances I expect our research arm to seek opportunities
                        for sharing survey costs with others. A major responsibility is to utilize
                        resources prudently. We will not undertake surveys that are only vaguely
                        “promising.” We must have maximum reasonable assurance of ultimate utility
                        before surveys are undertaken.</p>
                    <p>2. Envisioned action implications will be clearly identified in each project
                        proposal. These proposals must describe how reliable, useful, and essential
                        information will be supplied on specific subjects or issues of primary
                        concern to precisely defined research consumers within and/or outside of the
                        Agency.</p>
                    <p>3. Ideally, we would have the capacity to collect and articulate the kind of
                        knowledge described above about all societies. Limited resources, however,
                        require that we focus our attention first on those societies which are both
                        highly important to American interests <hi rend="italic">and</hi> most
                        likely to yield the kind of information we seek given the methodologies at
                        our disposal. The following 14 nations will be considered countries of
                        concentration for Agency research during <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>
                        1980: United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Japan,

                        two countries are included because of their importance, but any research
                        proposals regarding them must conform to the same operational guidelines as
                        proposals for the other 12 countries.) As very important needs <hi

                        this group, <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> management will entertain

                        ATTITUDES</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> The average Soviet citizen is inclined to
                        hold positive attitudes toward the American people, even to the point of
                        feeling a special sense of kinship with Americans. But at the same time, he
                        is likely to have predominantly unfavorable perceptions of American society
                        and the American system.</p>
                    <p>These were among the strongest impressions of Soviet attitudes toward the
                        U.S. received by Americans working at the <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >USICA</gloss> “Agriculture <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>”
                        Exhibit in the Soviet Union. The majority of Soviet visitors at the exhibit
                        showings in six cities indicated by their questions and comments to exhibit
                        personnel that their perceptions of American domestic conditions and foreign
                        policy are shaped primarily by the Soviet mass media and by foreign
                        information sources which are selected and channeled to the public by the
                        Soviet government.</p>
                    <p>The picture of the U.S. presented by Soviet official sources is one-sidedly
                        negative, with emphasis placed upon the social, political, economic,
                        cultural and psychological ills of American society. Despite fairly
                        widespread skepticism about the accuracy and completeness of the Soviet
                        media’s picture of the U.S., Soviet citizens are indeed influenced by it and
                        have little choice but to base their perceptions upon the information
                        available to them. For the most part, they lack satisfactory <pb n="549"
                            facs="0598" xml:id="pg_549"/>alternative sources of information and have
                        no opportunity to obtain information firsthand. It is difficult for them
                        even to recognize the gaps in their knowledge of the U.S. and their
                        misperceptions, and still harder to fill in the gaps and correct erroneous
                        beliefs.</p>
                    <p>Most members of the Soviet population—skeptics and true believers alike—are
                        interested in the same questions regarding American society: the issues
                        which are constantly discussed by the Soviet media, such as unemployment,
                        high cost of living, expensive higher education and medical care, poverty,
                        crime, violence and pornography. These problems are widely regarded as
                        manifestations of the deeper flaws of American society, which, in the Soviet
                        view, include lack of order; excessive complexity, individualism and
                        competitiveness; unequal distribution of resources; and lack of concern for
                        the needs of the citizenry, which forces the individual to face too many
                        choices and take too many risks.</p>
                    <p>Many young people are much more open-minded and favorable toward American
                        society than are their elders. It is also noteworthy that residents of the
                        larger, more cosmopolitan cities are more knowledgeable about the U.S. and
                        tend to be more positive in their attitudes than are citizens in provincial
                        towns and rural regions.</p>
                    <p>The average Soviet citizen demonstrates considerable concern about the state
                        of Soviet-American relations, although—at least publicly—he has little
                        inclination to discuss specific bilateral issues. While he expresses a
                        strong desire for peace, cooperation and increased contacts between the U.S.
                        and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, he maintains an equally strong
                        sense of competition with the U.S., this competitiveness manifesting itself
                        in the incessant making of comparisons between the two countries. <hi

                            target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” (<gloss target="#t_AGUSA_1"
                        >AGUSA</gloss>) Exhibit visited six cities in the Soviet Union—Kiev,
                        Tselinograd, Dushanbe, Kishinev, Moscow and Rostov-on-Don—between March 1978
                        and June 1979. Specific information on each of the city showings is
                        contained in individual reports available from the Office of Research. This
                        particular paper, however, focuses on insights derived from the overall
                        exhibit experience about the nature of Soviet views of the United States.
                        The substance and tone of exhibit visitors’ questions and comments to the
                        Russian-speaking exhibit guides serve in part as the basis for some general
                        conclusions about the concerns, perceptions and attitudes of average Soviet
                        citizens in regard to the American people and American society.</p>
                    <p>Several caveats should be stated at the outset. First, there is always
                        considerable danger in relying on firsthand observations, particularly when
                        a cultural gap exists between observer and subject. Second, the <pb n="550"
                            facs="0599" xml:id="pg_550"/>constraints of the exhibit setting, which
                        sometimes result in Soviet visitors being less than candid, must be noted.
                        Third, a high level of tension in the atmosphere at <gloss
                            target="#t_AGUSA_1">AGUSA</gloss>, due largely to the particular
                        sensitivity of the exhibit theme, was often not conducive to forthright and
                        relaxed conversations between the Americans and the Soviet visitors. Fourth,
                        exhibit audiences are not necessarily representative of the Soviet public at
                        large, and it is often the more activist—rather than the typical—visitor who
                        enters into conversation with the guides. Finally, it should be noted that
                        this report is based on impressions derived from conversations held with a
                        wide variety of Soviet citizens both within and outside the exhibit, and not
                        on a structured interview methodology.</p>
                    <p>Despite these reservations, the information collected during the <gloss
                            target="#t_AGUSA_1">AGUSA</gloss> tour is of considerable value.
                        American researchers’ opportunities for extensive, informal, direct contacts
                        with Soviet citizens are extremely scarce. This was an unusual chance for an
                        American observer to spend fifteen months in the Soviet Union, in daily
                        contact with Soviet people of varied backgrounds. Moreover, it was possible
                        to record the impressions and observations of a diverse group of Americans,
                        who were also directly and constantly interacting with Soviet citizens.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Perceptions of the American People</p>
                    <p>There is a widespread tendency among Soviet citizens from all strata of the
                        population to draw a distinction between the American people and the
                        American “system,” which includes, in the Soviet mind, government, big
                        business, the military-industrial complex, and the values and beliefs
                        underlying American political and social institutions as well as those
                        institutions themselves. This distinction between people and system fits in
                        with the official Soviet ideological model of capitalist countries: the
                        masses are good, ordinary working folk who exist apart from and are
                        oppressed by the small class of rich and powerful capitalists and the
                        institutions which serve the latter’s interests. (Many Americans, of course,
                        have a comparable outlook, separating the Russian people, who are perceived
                        as essentially good, from the Soviet state—the regime, institutions and
                        ideology—which is perceived as bad.)</p>
                    <p>Americans are granted high marks by Soviet people for their industriousness
                        and energy, their efficiency, cleverness and innovativeness. Many Soviets
                        also ascribe an adventurousness, a bold “pioneering spirit” to Americans,
                        which they admire, although some feel this trait in our national character
                        has its dangerous side. The tremendous respect for American technical genius
                        leads sometimes to unrealistic expectations that every American possesses a
                        degree of technical expertise and is fascinated by technology. This notion
                        also sometimes devel<pb n="551" facs="0600" xml:id="pg_551"/>ops into the
                        conviction that “Americans can do anything,” and when faced with evidence
                        that this is not the case, Soviets may react strongly, with bitter
                        disappointment or with scathing contempt for the “fallen giant.”</p>
                    <p>Many Soviet citizens seem to feel a certain kinship with Americans that they
                        do not feel with other peoples. They are often puzzled and disappointed to
                        find that the average American does not reciprocate this feeling, and does
                        not have the great curiosity about the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> that his Soviet counterpart has about the U.S. Most Soviet
                        citizens have heard, through the Soviet press, that there is widespread
                        ignorance about the Soviet Union among Americans. This is difficult for most
                        to accept, and if they accept it, even more difficult to explain; is it
                        attributable, they wonder, to Americans’ lack of access to information (as
                        the Soviet press claims), or can it really be that most Americans simply are
                        not very interested in life in the Soviet Union? If they are not interested,
                        why not? While this is viewed by some as distressing evidence of the low
                        esteem in which Americans hold the Soviet people and their culture, others
                        pass it off as an indication of Americans’ general intellectual apathy and
                        self-centeredness.</p>
                    <p>In large measure, this sense of kinship with Americans felt by so many
                        Soviets may be linked with the prevalent perception that as the citizens of
                        the two “great powers” which dominate the world, we are in a special elite
                        class. Visitors to <gloss target="#t_AGUSA_1">AGUSA</gloss> often described
                        a bond between us in these terms. It seems that such comments frequently
                        serve as self-reassuring assertions of Soviet national strength and power,
                        efforts to underscore that the Soviet Union, which long lagged behind the
                        U.S., has now, at least in some respects, achieved equality.</p>
                    <p>The sense of kinship, though, also appears to spring from the perception of a
                        basic similarity between the American and the Russian character. The shared
                        attributes most often cited by exhibit visitors were simplicity,
                        unpretentiousness, gregariousness and hospitality.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Provincial Attitudes and Negative Stereotypes</p>
                    <p>A number of the least sophisticated exhibit visitors, generally peasants and
                        workers from the more isolated provincial villages who have little or no
                        contact with foreigners, did not appear to share this feeling of closeness
                        to Americans. They tended to regard Americans as creatures unlike
                        themselves. Many of these people, never having seen “real Americans” before
                        the exhibit, had formed rather romanticized images of how they look and act.
                        Expecting exotic and glamorous beings, some people were disappointed by the
                        decidedly ordinary appearance of the guides and the Americans pictured in
                        exhibit photographs, films and slides. Others, however, were gratified to
                        find Americans much less imposing than they had anticipated.</p>
                    <pb n="552" facs="0601" xml:id="pg_552"/>
                    <p>Certain negative stereotypes of Americans were sometimes reflected in
                        exhibitgoers’ remarks. Americans were seen as coldly calculating (“Americans
                        marry for money, not love”), materialistic, superficial, and insincere
                        (“Americans smile even when they don’t mean it”). A feeling shared by a not
                        insignificant number of people—including both simple workers and
                        sophisticated members of the intelligentsia—is that Americans are decent
                        people, but, particularly in comparison with Russians, they are shallow and
                        lacking in “soul.”</p>

                    <p>In contrast to the mainly positive feelings expressed about the American
                        people, attitudes toward the society and system tend to be unfavorable,
                        reflecting the influence of the heavily negative presentation of America in
                        official Soviet information sources.</p>
                    <p>It is commonly felt that American society is immensely frightening in its
                        complexity, disorder and competitiveness. The typical Soviet citizen has an
                        exaggerated notion of the instability of American society and the insecurity
                        of the average individual’s life in such a society. He imagines that there
                        is constant crisis, uncertainty, pressure to take risks. Conditioned by the
                        Soviet media to focus on the failures and drawbacks of Western capitalist
                        society, he is apt to see every situation in the worst possible terms.
                        Rather than looking at the challenge or potential gains which are part of
                        risktaking, he concentrates on the psychological tensions and potential
                        losses. He has a tendency to focus on the least fortunate members of
                        American society, and to consider that they represent the norm, rather than
                        an extreme end of the spectrum.</p>
                    <p>Many Soviets evidently believe that Americans can never truly relax. Life in
                        the West is seen as a constant struggle; the ordinary American must always
                        be on guard against financial ruin, loss of employment, criminal violence.
                        Even if he is lucky enough to avoid disaster, he still must cope with the
                        complicatedness of everyday life. The average Soviet citizen is aware that,
                        compared with Soviet society, American society leaves far more choices to
                        the individual—too many choices, in the Soviet view. While the Soviet
                        citizen may be intrigued, even somewhat attracted by this notion of abundant
                        choices, his overriding response is likely to be one of dismay and fear.
                        Dealing with so many choices and decisions causes confusion, anxiety and
                        fatigue, he feels; it makes life harder. Not only does it put undue strain
                        on the individual, but it is a major factor in the general disorderliness of
                        American society. Comments made by visitors to the exhibit would often
                        reflect these attitudes; people would say that life in the Soviet Union is
                        “simpler” and therefore better and more enjoyable than life in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>To some people, the most threatening aspect of American society is its
                        individualism and competitiveness. Most people tend to have an <pb n="553"
                            facs="0602" xml:id="pg_553"/>exaggerated and distorted perception of the
                        manifestations of these values in American life, based on the one-sided
                        information provided by the Soviet media. To be sure, there are individuals
                        who express approval of a system prizing private enterprise, the incentive
                        value of competition, and personal independence in all spheres of life. But
                        more commonly, Soviet people envision the U.S. as a nation of lonely,
                        alienated individuals, unable to rely on any sort of supportive group and
                        forced to compete rather than cooperate with their neighbors and colleagues.
                        In the typical Soviet view, because of the structure of society and its
                        prevailing values and mores, the American citizen is comparatively
                        unprotected by either official collectives (trade unions, youth groups) or
                        unofficial collectives (family, friends). Competition, almost always seen in
                        negative terms, is associated with the obsessive pursuit of money and power
                        widely regarded as characteristic of capitalist society. The conclusion
                        reached by many people seems to be that while the collective ethos might
                        have its drawbacks, the alternative is worse.</p>
                    <p>The average Soviet citizen is, of course, well aware of the problems in
                        Soviet society, but his knowledge of American society is, at best, patchy
                        and vague. Some people assume, in the absence of information to the
                        contrary, that Americans must cope with the same problems Soviets face
                        (deficits of consumer goods, housing shortages) <hi rend="italic">as well
                            as</hi> the problems peculiar to Western society: unemployment,
                        expensive medical care, high rate of inflation. While other people realize
                        that most of the major problems of Soviet society are not prevalent in the
                        U.S., they still lack clear and convincing information about actual
                        conditions outside the Soviet borders and are thus unable to develop a
                        satisfactory understanding of American society. A very large portion of the
                        information made available through official Soviet channels emphasizes the
                        West’s negative features. The Soviet media set the agenda for people’s
                        thinking about the U.S., influencing even those who are skeptical about the
                        veracity of the information sources, and those who would like to view
                        American society in a positive light.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Exposure to Western Information Sources</p>
                    <p>Direct, albeit limited, exposure to Western information sources often serves
                        further to confuse and mislead Soviet citizens rather than clarify their
                        perceptions of American society. American books, films, photographs and
                        other items made accessible to the public are carefully selected to
                        reinforce the unfavorable image of American society presented in official
                        Soviet sources. The Soviet press, for example, frequently quotes statements
                        from American sources which support whatever point is being made about
                        Western society. These references carry considerable weight. In arguing
                        various points with the guides, exhibit visitors would often exclaim, as if
                        it were the final, irrefutable evidence in their favor, “But your own
                        newspaper, <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, says <pb n="554"
                            facs="0603" xml:id="pg_554"/>. . .” It is difficult for individuals who
                        doubt or reject the official Soviet version of a given aspect of American
                        society to deal with foreign source material which supports the Soviet
                        line.</p>
                    <p>A key problem is that the majority of Soviet citizens fail to grasp the
                        fundamental differences between the Soviet and the American news media. They
                        generally do not realize that in the U.S., “news” consists of information
                        about unusual events, about disasters and problems, controversies and
                        sensations. Many people automatically assume that the American media report
                        on routine and normal occurrences, as the Soviet media purport to do.
                        Curiously, even when individuals are aware of differences between the Soviet
                        and American media, they do not necessarily interpret information from
                        American sources in the light of that knowledge. They may have heard, for
                        instance, that various opinions are expressed in different newspapers, or
                        even within one newspaper, but it does not necessarily follow that when they
                        read a quotation from <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> in <hi
                            rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, they will recognize that it represents one
                        view, perhaps a minority opinion, and in any case not a universally accepted
                        statement of fact.</p>
                    <p>As with the press, when Soviets view American films such as <hi rend="italic"
                            >White Line Fever</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Front</hi>, they often
                        assume that normal everyday American reality is being depicted. In fact,
                        some people conclude that American society may actually be worse than these
                        films dare show; they are extrapolating from their own experience with
                        Soviet films, where some social problems may be treated, but not revealed to
                        be as serious, profound or widespread as they are in reality.</p>
                    <p>Even American information sources designed for a Soviet audience may
                        sometimes contribute to the confusion, due to the Soviet people’s
                        unfamiliarity with American ways of presenting information and with the
                        whole context of American society. For example, a journalist’s low-key,
                        even-handed treatment of a controversial issue (an effective approach for an
                        American audience) may be interpreted by Soviet readers as a sign of the
                        weakness of the journalist’s actual position on the issue. A foreign radio
                        broadcast on the current developments of a particular issue may be poorly
                        understood by Soviet listeners because they lack the background information
                        essential for comprehension.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Subjects of Concern</p>
                    <p>Most of the exhibit visitors’ questions and comments could be classified into
                        three categories: ordinary daily life in America; American perceptions of
                        and attitudes toward the Soviet Union; and problems in American society. The
                        third category was the largest, and included questions on the social,
                        political, economic, cultural and psychological ills of American society:
                        the high cost of living, expensive medical care and education, unemployment,
                        crime, violence, poverty, and so on. <pb n="555" facs="0604" xml:id="pg_555"
                        />These issues, constantly stressed by the Soviet media, were foremost in
                        many people’s minds, as were the deeper, underlying problems manifested in
                        these particular issues: exploitation of the weak, inequality, obsessive
                        materialism, lack of national and individual goals, general malaise,
                        self-centeredness. But by no means did everyone who asked about these
                        problems believe they truly exist as described in Soviet sources. The
                        attitudes held by questioners varied, and were often not even identifiable.
                        Some people were simply curious to hear how an American would handle such
                        questions. Others did appear to have a highly negative picture of America,
                        and they asked their questions with the intent of exposing the evils of the
                        West, and discomfiting and discrediting the guides. Still others wanted
                        direct confirmation from the guides of information they had already
                        obtained, perhaps from Voice of America, which contradicted the official
                        Soviet version of one or another aspect of American reality. Whatever the
                        individual’s attitude, however, it is noteworthy that the same
                        issues—unemployment, unequal access to material goods, high cost and limited
                        availability of medical care and education, etc.—were etched in people’s
                        minds; that is what they first thought of in connection with the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>In view of the Soviet news media’s considerable attention to foreign affairs,
                        including Soviet-American relations, it is interesting that exhibit visitors
                        rarely initiated conversations on specific current international issues,
                        such as <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. Although one suspects that
                        more candid and detailed discussion of such topics occurs in private, at the
                        exhibit people usually confined themselves to expressing the familiar
                        platitudes (which the guides heard dozens of times each day) about the need
                        for peace, cooperation and increased contacts between our two countries.</p>
                    <p>When foreign policy issues did come up, visitors seemed primarily interested
                        in hearing the guides’ personal opinions or explanations of the official
                        American government position. Visitors’ own comments, when expressed at all,
                        tended to follow the official Soviet line. The American role in
                        international affairs was criticized as “aggressive” and “imperialistic,”
                        while the Soviet Union was seen as supporting peace-loving and progressive
                        peoples everywhere. There seemed to be considerable feeling that the
                        American people are “misled” on international issues by “certain circles”
                        within the U.S., or by outside powers. Regarding American-Chinese relations
                        and how they affect the Soviet Union—the issue of greatest concern to
                        visitors—many expressed fears that the U.S. is lining up with China against
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>; it was felt that Americans are
                        naive to trust the Chinese, who, according to Soviet predictions, will
                        betray America just as they betrayed their erstwhile friend, the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>Visitors were greatly concerned about American perceptions of a “Soviet
                        military threat” and often repeated their hopes that “certain <pb n="556"
                            facs="0605" xml:id="pg_556"/>circles” in the U.S. would not use the
                        excuse of a “mythical Soviet threat” to justify an attack on the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Age Factor</p>
                    <p>There is naturally more variety in Soviet people’s views of the U.S. than any
                        general summary of prevalent attitudes might suggest. A particularly
                        noticeable difference in attitudes exists between members of the “younger
                        generation” (born post-war), and their elders.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, young people take a more positive view of the U.S., are more
                        accurately and broadly informed in some areas, and seem more open to
                        information coming from American and other non-Soviet sources. Young <gloss
                            target="#t_Komsomol_1">Komsomol</gloss> agitators were in evidence in
                        each city visited by the exhibit, but they were far outnumbered by the
                        friendly, fascinated young people who gathered around the guides and made
                        repeated visits to the exhibit. American values and practices which are
                        regarded with fear or disapproval by older Soviets are often embraced
                        enthusiastically by members of the younger generation. The independence of
                        American youth—living apart from parents after high school, making their own
                        decisions on education, military service, work—appeals to many Soviet young
                        people, who chafe against the physical and psychological constraints of
                        Soviet society. Those under 35 tend to value security and stability less
                        than do their elders, for whom the war and its accompanying dislocation are
                        vivid memories.</p>
                    <p>Many Soviet young people have a distinct tendency to idealize American life,
                        and in some cases their perceptions are as vague, one-sided and unrealistic
                        in one direction as their parents’ ideas are in the other. It is the
                        interpretation of information, rather than what and how much information
                        they possess, that seems most to distinguish the generations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Ethnic and Religious Factors</p>
                    <p>Predictably, certain ethnic and religious groups within the Soviet population
                        are inclined to have highly positive feelings and perceptions about the U.S.
                        In general, those groups which feel alienated from the Soviet regime and
                        Soviet society are greatly attracted to the United States. Among exhibit
                        visitors, the best represented of these groups were the Baptists (and
                        believers from some other Christian sects), Jews, ethnic Germans, Balts,
                        Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians from the Western Ukraine.</p>
                    <p>Members of such groups generally put more energy into obtaining information
                        from outside sources, and often have more and better information about
                        American life, although this is not necessarily the case. (Jewish citizens
                        are frequently the most knowledgeable, thanks in part to information
                        received from friends and relatives who have <pb n="557" facs="0606"
                            xml:id="pg_557"/>emigrated.) Many of them think a good deal about life
                        outside the Soviet Union and discuss it extensively among themselves.
                        Nonetheless, they often have difficulty comprehending many of the same
                        aspects of American life which pose difficulties for other Soviets.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Geographic and Socioeconomic Factors</p>
                    <p>The level of knowledge about America is, understandably, highest in large
                        metropolitan cities such as Moscow and Kiev, where the population has the
                        most contact with foreigners, access to a variety of Soviet and foreign
                        information sources, and includes a concentration of highly educated,
                        sophisticated individuals. The residents of the most isolated and
                        undeveloped areas (Tselinograd, rural Moldavia) are much less well informed,
                        but even these areas appear to have their local intelligentsia—a small
                        community of people who are fairly knowledgeable about the West and astute
                        in interpreting Soviet reportage of the outside world. (Many of these people
                        were educated or spent time working in the major cities.)</p>
                    <p>Each geographic area visited by the exhibit had its own particular character,
                        and observers noted the predominance of certain kinds of attitudes in each
                        area. In Rostov, for example, people were inclined to be fiercely patriotic
                        and thus critical of the U.S.; they often expressed strong views on issues
                        but did not usually support those views with specific facts. Rostov struck
                        the American exhibit staff as a typical blue collar, working class, rough
                        and tumble town. Its character was formed by a number of factors, among them
                        the Cossack historical and folk traditions of the region, Rostov’s role as
                        an important river port, and the presence of the enormous Rostsel’mash farm
                        machinery plant, which employs a huge number of people and wields
                        considerable influence in many spheres of local life. Extent and type of
                        education, profession, and income level do have an influence on individual
                        perceptions and attitudes, but on the basis of observations in the exhibit
                        setting, it would be impossible to venture any analysis of these factors.
                        Most evident, rather, were the differences between, on the one hand, the
                        urban, well-educated, professional people of the several more cosmopolitan
                        cities, and, on the other, the residents of provincial cities and villages,
                        be they peasants, workers, specialists or government officials. Provincial
                        citizens were more accepting of official Soviet information sources, and
                        less open to new and conflicting information. They were inclined to express
                        less skepticism than their fellow citizens in Kiev and Moscow. They were
                        also apt to have more trouble with concepts which are unfamiliar and
                        confusing to any Soviet citizen, such as the interactions of the private and
                        public sectors in American society or the nature of American
                        individualism.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                    <p>The average Soviet citizen bases most of his perceptions of the U.S. on the
                        information presented by the official Soviet mass media and <pb n="558"
                            facs="0607" xml:id="pg_558"/>the foreign materials (literary works,
                        films, etc.) chosen by the regime for distribution within the country. Some
                        information from outside sources is received through unofficial channels,
                        but the large majority of citizens rely primarily or exclusively on Soviet
                        or Soviet-approved sources.</p>
                    <p>Most citizens do not accept unquestioningly and wholeheartedly what the
                        Soviet media tell them; with some exceptions, most realize that only
                        selected information is made available, and therefore their perceptions of
                        American society are likely to be somewhat off the mark. At the same time,
                        they recognize that the information provided them is not sheer falsification
                        and exaggeration. The question is: How much and exactly what can be
                        believed? The average citizen, with little access to alternative information
                        sources and no opportunity to make firsthand observations, has no
                        satisfactory way to develop and evaluate his information. The best way, if
                        one is interested, energetic and daring enough, is to seek out as many
                        sources of information as possible and compare them all. A few people do
                        precisely that.</p>
                    <p>Still, while information obtained from foreign sources such as <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is carefully weighed and pondered, it is
                        often neither fully accepted, nor well understood. In cases where
                        information thus obtained conflicts with old familiar images, people often
                        find it easier and more comfortable to retain the old images. Moreover,
                        information from outside may not correct misperceptions or fill in blank
                        spots because of the Soviet citizen’s inability to put the information in
                        proper context or because of problems with the methods used in
                        communicating. Reconciling conflicting information is, of course, a serious
                        problem. Observers at <gloss target="#t_AGUSA_1">AGUSA</gloss> noted, as
                        have others, that many Soviets often appear able to hold what to us seem
                        glaringly conflicting perceptions and attitudes without feeling any apparent
                        need to reconcile them.</p>
                    <p>Judging from visitors’ questions and comments at the exhibit, as well as
                        other evidence, the average Soviet citizen has a picture of the United
                        States which is incomplete, distorted and confused. While inclined to think
                        favorably of the American people, he tends to view American society in a
                        predominantly negative light, perceiving it as frighteningly disorderly,
                        complex, unjust and unstable.</p>
                    <p>Although attitudes toward the U.S. vary considerably, depending in part upon
                        the individual’s age, place of residence and background, most
                        people—whatever their attitudes—are greatly curious about the problems of
                        American society which are constantly spotlighted by the Soviet media.
                        Soviet portrayals of the extremes of poverty and deprivation in America, on
                        the one hand, and wealth and self-indulgence on the other, appear to make a
                        particularly strong impression upon people.</p>
                    <p>The average Soviet citizen is, at least in public, critical of American
                        foreign policy. Generally reluctant to discuss international issues in <pb
                            n="559" facs="0608" xml:id="pg_559"/>concrete terms, he tends to follow
                        the official line if pressed to express an opinion. He is not hesitant,
                        however, to voice a strong desire for a peaceful and friendly relationship
                        between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. This desire for
                        peace and friendship coexists with a sharp sense of competition with the
                        U.S., as exemplified in exhibit visitors’ ceaseless drawing of comparisons
                        between the two societies in every area imaginable.</p>

                        <salute>Dear <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>Ever since <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> came into being, a good
                        many questions have been asked about the meaning of the Agency’s so-called
                        “second mandate.” You and your colleagues in the field, in particular, have
                        wondered how this new “mandate” affects your work.</p>
                    <p>This is an important subject—both for you and for us in Washington. I would,
                        therefore, like to offer some general guidelines for your use.</p>
                    <p>To begin, I should make clear my discomfort with terms like “the second
                        mandate,” “mutuality,” “the American learning experience.” I find nothing
                        inherently wrong with these terms. And I have no felicitous substitutes to
                        offer. I fear, however, that the use of such shorthand tends to obscure
                        rather than clarify. One danger is that such terms evoke a sense of mystery
                        about something that is not at all mysterious. Another concern is that they
                        may imply inflexible activities carried out only in certain ways and only by
                        certain specified elements of the Agency—implications that are patently
                        false.</p>
                    <p>What we are talking about is quite simple: <hi rend="italic">it is the
                            responsibility of this Agency to assist in enabling Americans to enhance
                            their understanding of other societies</hi>—their histories, their
                        cultures, their values and their aspirations, where they are coming from and
                        why they behave as they do. It is not unlike our responsibility to increase
                        foreign understanding of U.S. society and institutions.</p>
                    <pb n="560" facs="0609" xml:id="pg_560"/>
                    <p>This responsibility derives directly from the President’s message to the
                        Congress transmitting Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1977.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d185fn2">See <ref target="#d93">Document 93</ref>.</note> In his
                        message, the President explicitly set as a goal of the new Agency: “to tell
                        ourselves about the world, so as to enrich our own culture as well as to
                        give us the understanding to deal effectively with problems among
                        nations.”</p>
                    <p>The President reiterated our responsibility in this area in his memorandum to
                        me of March 13, 1978: “It is also in our interest—and in the interest of
                        other nations—that Americans have the opportunity to understand the
                        histories, cultures and problems of others so that we can come to understand
                        their hopes, perceptions and aspirations. In so doing, the Agency will
                        contribute to our capacity as a people and as a government to manage our
                        foreign affairs with sensitivity, in an effective and responsible way.”<note

                    </p>
                    <p>Recognition of our firm obligations in this area should not be taken to mean
                        that <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> is to become the teacher and
                        America the classroom. Indeed, our focus must be on stimulating, assisting
                        and enhancing the work of non-governmental organizations and individuals in
                        this area—work that in scale and potential impact far exceeds our own
                        limited capacities.</p>
                    <p>I would stress the fact that we do not have any pat formulas. And, while I
                        note that the mandate is new with the new Agency, I also appreciate that
                        many of you have been doing good work in this area for some years. We will
                        build on this previous work; and we will break new ground. All elements of
                        the Agency can and should participate—thoughtfully, imaginatively and
                        fully—in the generation of creative approaches to enhancing Americans’
                        understanding of others.</p>
                    <p>There are, however, some existing guidelines from which you should work.
                        First and foremost, you should understand that different elements and
                        activities of the Agency are involved in this effort in different ways:</p>
                    <p>(1) <gloss target="#t_ECA_1">ECA</gloss>’s Office of Private Sector Programs
                        is the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> element of the Agency which has as its
                        fundamental purpose helping to enhance Americans’ understanding of
                        others.</p>
                    <p>(2) Most elements and programs of the Agency, while having a different
                        primary purpose and rationale, can and should make an important contribution
                        to Americans’ understanding of others;</p>
                    <p>(3) Some efforts of the Agency—principally international broadcasting and
                        materials produced for distribution abroad—are specifically precluded from
                        involvement in this area.</p>
                    <pb n="561" facs="0610" xml:id="pg_561"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ECA_1">ECA</gloss>’s Office of Private Sector Programs is
                        now working under a new statement of purpose and refined guidelines. It will
                        carry out its purpose—to help enhance Americans’ understanding of
                        others—through grants supporting non-profit projects conducted by American
                        organizations outside the Federal government. It will focus on projects that
                        involve American leaders or organizations most likely to stimulate the
                        thinking, learning, and perceptions of broader groups of Americans.</p>
                    <p>Just as we do in our work overseas, it will support efforts which promise a
                        sustained impact over time, with the maximum multiplier effect. Since
                        Private Sector grants will be awarded only to projects originating with and
                        submitted by organizations outside of the Federal government, this effort
                        will operate largely outside of the Country Plan process. You, however, are
                        in an excellent position to perceive the adequacy of American understanding
                        of the society in which you are working. Your sharing of your knowledge and
                        perceptions—through the Country Plan and other mechanisms—must therefore
                        enhance our own understanding of where and how this effort can best be
                        focused. (I am enclosing the Office of Private Sector Programs’ new
                        guidelines so that you will have a detailed understanding of its purpose and
                            operations.)<note n="4" xml:id="d185fn4">Attached but not printed is an

                    <p>While the Office of Private Sector Programs is the only element of the Agency
                        which has this work as its exclusive purpose, virtually all
                        elements—specifically including you in the field—have a contribution to make
                        and should be involved. There is no one program, no one activity, no single
                        element of the Agency which has a corner on this market.</p>
                    <p>I point up the following merely to illustrate the range of our involvement in
                        activities that make an important contribution to enhancing Americans’
                        understanding of other societies:</p>
                    <p>—The entire <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName> academic
                        exchange program, whether sending Americans overseas or bringing foreigners
                        to this country.</p>
                    <p>—Our work in establishing linkages between universities in this country and
                        those overseas.</p>
                    <p>—Our work with the U.S. Office of Education in secondary teacher
                        exchanges.</p>
                    <p>—Our work with the National Endowments for the Arts and for the Humanities,
                        with the Smithsonian and with the private sector, to enhance Americans’
                        awareness of other cultures and their arts.</p>
                    <p>—Our year-long involvement with the President’s Commission on Foreign
                        Language and International Studies, which is soon to make <pb n="562"
                            facs="0611" xml:id="pg_562"/>recommendations designed to help insure the
                        competence of Americans to deal effectively with other societies.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d185fn5">See <ref target="#d168fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                168</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>—Our research activities, which have the specific goal of supplying us with
                        essential information on the concerns and attitudes of other peoples.</p>
                    <p>Other activities involve you and your staff more directly:</p>
                    <p>—American Participants are sent abroad primarily to enhance foreigners’
                        understanding of some aspect of American society and/or policy. One of the
                        criteria for their recruitment, however, is that they are influential
                        Americans who have the capacities and the positions for sharing their
                        understanding of foreign societies with other Americans upon their return to
                        the United States. It is your responsibility to insure that <gloss
                            target="#t_Amparts_1">Amparts</gloss> have appropriate opportunities to
                        learn the concerns and perspectives of their professional counterparts in
                        the host country.</p>
                    <p>—Cultural Presentations and specialists afford similar opportunities for
                        enhancing Americans’ understanding of others—if their programs overseas are
                        properly arranged and conducted.</p>
                    <p>—And the same point can be made, in reverse, about <gloss target="#t_IV_1"
                            >IV</gloss> grantees. The principal purpose of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> program is to establish or enhance a
                        productive relationship with influential foreigners by giving them a
                        firsthand experience with the United States. At the same time, <gloss
                            target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss>’s can also be an important means of
                        increasing Americans’ understanding of other societies. The Agency’s Office
                        of International Visitors will be working with programming agencies to
                        insure that this is done whenever it is appropriate and in a manner that
                        does not interfere with the main purpose of the <gloss target="#t_IV_1"
                            >IV</gloss> program. You should sound out your grantees along these
                        lines—offering them the opportunity to explain their own countries and areas
                        of expertise but without either giving them the feeling that they are
                        obligated to “pay” for their invitations or unduly raising their
                        expectations about the opportunities that may be available to them.</p>
                    <p>The key point, again, is that not one but many areas of our work provide
                        opportunities to enhance Americans’ understanding of other societies. Each
                        of these should be utilized in every appropriate way. There is no single
                        approach, no how-to-do-it kit. What is called for is your own thinking and
                        imagination in a given situation, with a specific opportunity at hand.</p>
                    <p>There are, obviously, some exceptions. The Voice of America does not
                        broadcast to the United States. The <gloss target="#t_WirelessFile_1"

                        available to us for enhancing Americans’ understanding of others.</p>
                    <p>Two other points should be noted: (1) We are not in the business of assisting
                        other governments to advocate their policies and points of view to the
                        American people; and (2) as I explained in my recent letter on the Agency’s
                        cultural initiative,<note n="6" xml:id="d185fn6">Reference is presumably to

                    <p>In the weeks ahead, we will be working to refine our efforts in this area.
                        Private Sector Programs, in particular, will be sharpening its approaches
                        and exploring new possibilities.</p>
                    <p>I am prepared to consider making additional funds available for this work,
                        should the need and the opportunities present themselves persuasively.</p>
                    <p>I encourage you to do all that you can—thinking and acting imaginatively—to
                        help enhance the opportunities for Americans to enlarge their knowledge and
                        understanding of others.</p>

                    <p>The International Communication Agency has two major cultural projects well
                        under way. One is a visit of the <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Alvin
                            Ailey</persName> dance troupe; the other is a showing in Cuba of an
                        American art exhibit. While there has been a general policy against cultural
                        exchanges with Cuba, members of our Agency in consultation with the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff have agreed that these two projects
                        are desirable exceptions.</p>
                    <p>According to the manager of the <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Ailey</persName>
                        dance troupe, the Cuban Government has agreed to finance in-country housing
                        and to take care of transportation—including material—to and from Cuba. The
                        offer is being confirmed with the Cubans. <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >USICA</gloss> will pay performance fees unless private financing, such
                        as foundation support, can be arranged. The company cannot make an April
                        1980 date proposed by the Cubans and is awaiting a Cuban reply to a
                        counterproposal for the first week in September.</p>
                    <p>On October 26, a National Endowment for the Arts panel will identify existing
                        art shows that respond to our criteria for an exhibit in Cuba. <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> funds have been earmarked. The Cubans
                        have expressed an interest in having such an exhibit. The outlook for the
                        project is good.</p>
                    <p>Should further opportunities to reach the Cuban people with U.S. cultural
                        activities present themselves, we will discuss these with your staff.</p>

                        several hundred U.S. citizen organizations. Although only a handful are
                        active in some of the smaller Caribbean islands, as many as 100 or more are

                    <p>—A major “Close-Up” documentary on Iran which included a discussion of Soviet
                        concern over the religious revival in Iran and its impact on the Soviet
                        Muslim population.</p>
                    <p>—A three-part series now being completed on the 1400th Anniversary of Islam
                        in which our Middle East correspondent interviewed a number of leaders on
                        the world-wide impact of the religion. The program includes attention to
                        Soviet treatment of the Muslim minority.</p>
                    <p>Among the approaches to programming on this subject presently under study,
                        the most appealing appears to be inclusion of the Soviet <pb n="570"
                            facs="0619" xml:id="pg_570"/>treatment of this minority within the
                        larger subject of Muslims throughout the world. More specifically, in
                        addition to information broadcast on Soviet handling of Muslims, we would,
                        through interviews and features, characterize the lives of Muslims in other
                        parts of the world, including the United States. This comparative approach,
                        combined with historical information on Muslim life, charting its
                        development and contributions, would likely be the most credible and
                        effective. It would, of course, specifically include the points you make
                        about Soviet policies and actions.</p>
                    <p>Though your memorandum specifically addresses our broadcasting function, we
                        will also consider all material on Soviet Muslims for use by other <gloss

                        more useful, or at least can be an added complement to our broadcasts.<note

                        <item>Proposal for Enhancement of U.S. Non-Government Activities in Central
                            America and the Caribbean.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Because of your personal interest in helping the peoples of the Caribbean and
                        Central America to cope with their economic and political problems, and your
                        desire to engage the U.S. private sector in supporting economic development
                        and democratic processes in the two regions, I have prepared a series of
                        recommendations for your consideration. I believe that these
                        recommendations, if implemented, will stimulate private organizations as
                        well as state and local governments to intensify their activities in these
                        two areas with little or no incremental cost to the United States
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>There already exists an impressive number of U.S. citizen organizations
                        active in Central America and the Caribbean. A number of others which
                        command significant resources would, I believe, be responsive to an appeal
                        from you to support programs in these countries. These include not only
                        non-profit organizations, but also U.S. corporations with vested interests
                        in the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
                    <p>Although only a handful of organizations are present in some of the smaller
                        Caribbean islands, as many as 100 or more are involved to some extent in the
                        larger countries. I have attached a list of active organizations at Tab
                            1.<note n="2" xml:id="d190fn2">Attached but not printed is an undated
                            paper entitled “U.S. Private Organization in the Caribbean and Central
                            America, by Country.”</note> Further, under the aegis of Sister Cities
                        International and the Partners of the Americas, 50 cities and several
                        countries are linked to U.S. cities and states. An analysis of these
                        programs is attached at Tab 2.<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">Attached but not
                            printed is an undated paper entitled “State and Local Government Efforts
                            in Central America and the Caribbean.”</note> According to our
                        Ambassadors, many of these private organizations and state and local
                        government programs have had a visible impact in the development and
                        democratization processes of host countries.</p>
                    <p>In spite of the impressive work being done by these organizations, however,
                        more can and should be done. I have prepared, by country, <pb n="572"
                            facs="0621" xml:id="pg_572"/>illustrative lists of urgent requirements
                        in the Caribbean and Central America which are not now being fully met.
                        These requirements were identified in consultation with <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, our Ambassadors and private sources. In
                        every case I have suggested non-governmental organizations based in the
                        United States which appear to have the resources and skills to address the
                        identified need. The lists include both organizations already active in the
                        country and those which would be becoming involved for the first time.
                        Copies of the lists are attached at Tab 3.<note n="4" xml:id="d190fn4"
                            >Attached but not printed is an undated paper entitled “List of
                            Immediate Requirements.”</note> These lists should be considered as
                        illustrative of the kinds of contributions private organizations could make
                        rather than comprehensive lists of the needs of individual countries.</p>
                    <p>What is required is a catalyst of some sort to bring these organizations
                        together, to coordinate their efforts, and to stimulate activity by
                        organizations not now engaged in outreach programs in Central America and
                        the Caribbean. I believe you can serve as that catalyst. I recommend that
                        you convoke a meeting of representatives of non-governmental organizations
                        and state and local government representatives at the White House in the
                        near future. A suggested list of participants is attached at Tab 4<note
                            n="5" xml:id="d190fn5">Attached but not printed is an undated paper
                            entitled “Alphabetical Listing of Possible Participants at Core Group
                            Meeting.”</note> which we consider broadly representative of the kinds
                        of groups whose services are urgently needed in the Caribbean and Central
                        America. The purpose of the meeting would be:</p>
                    <p>—to explain that you have assigned a high priority to the Caribbean and
                        Central America, and to indicate your interest in private organization
                        activities in the two regions;</p>
                    <p>—propose the establishment of a new private non-profit organization which
                        would be charged with expanding the role of voluntary organizations in the
                        Caribbean and Central America. Between 50 and 100 founding members would be
                        desirable, drawn from a wide range of organizations representing business,
                        churches, foundations, the universities, service clubs and others. It could
                        be headed by a prominent citizen with an acknowledged interest in Central
                        America and the Caribbean. In addition to a Board and executive steering
                        group, the umbrella organization could organize subcommittees for each
                        country. Each of these subcommittees would visit its country, determine key
                        needs, and stimulate U.S. private sector activity to address the need. The
                        U.S. Government would support the organization’s activities but not become
                        directly involved;</p>
                    <p>—announce the establishment of an annual Presidential award for the
                        organization judged to have made the greatest impact on the <pb n="573"
                            facs="0622" xml:id="pg_573"/>processes of democratization and
                        development in the Caribbean and Central America. The award would be a medal
                        or cash grant, or both. Nominations would be made by our Ambassadors. This
                        would serve to focus public attention on private sector activities in the
                        two regions.</p>
                    <p>I believe these suggestions, if implemented, would help stimulate activity,
                        avoid duplication and make non-government organization activity more
                        supportive of broad policy objectives of the United States Government. If
                        you decide to implement these recommendations, it must be made clear to all
                        concerned that the Administration is not attempting to control or direct the
                        activities of private agencies and that no additional federal funds will be
                        available for expanded activities. Members of your staff should consult with
                        a core group of 15–20 private organization leaders before you convoke the
                        larger meeting to insure that there are no misunderstandings on these two
                        issues. A suggested list of contacts is attached at Tab 5.<note n="6"

                            presidential meeting on Latin America and the Caribbean. During the
                            course of the meeting, the President highlighted the utility of
                            people-to-people initiatives: “It is wrong to think that we can buy
                            friends, and I think that is our major problem. I don’t think that
                            people in the area think that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            really cares about them, that we are their friends. There are many ways
                            we can demonstrate this interest. We have a thousand major universities
                            in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and I could call and ask them
                            to participate in a program to help the area. If I called some business
                            leaders and told them we have a problem, and divided up
                            responsibilities, I am sure they would be glad to help. I believe we
                            could really help if we did this. The American people would be happy to
                            establish friendly relations directly with the people of the area. I
                            don’t feel that the people in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and
                            perhaps even in Costa Rica feel that we care about them; perhaps they
                            think that Cuba does.” (Carter Library, National Security Affairs, Staff

                        prepare a country-by-country inventory of non-governmental activities in the
                        Caribbean Basin. My idea was that a people-to-people strategy would be much
                        more effective if it were based on mobilizing and expanding existing
                        resources, rather than creating new ones. The package, which is attached,
                        contains the following: an inventory of existing private organizations
                        active in the area; a description of efforts by state and local government
                        in the area; suggestions on specific needs of individual countries in the
                        region and how these organizations could help meet these needs; and a list
                        of key organizations and people who we can use as a core group for a broader
                            effort.<note n="3" xml:id="d191fn3">Printed as <ref target="#d190"

                    <p>Cy and I propose that you encourage the establishment of a new private
                        non-profit “umbrella” commission to coordinate and expand the efforts of
                        U.S. voluntary organizations in the Caribbean Basin. This group could be
                        headed by a prominent person like Miami Mayor <persName corresp="#p_FM_1"
                            >Ferre</persName>, who knows the region very well, and it should include
                        leaders of these <pb n="575" facs="0624" xml:id="pg_575"/>organizations plus
                        state and local leaders (Jack Watson agrees that <persName corresp="#p_FM_1"
                            >Ferre</persName> would be a good chairman.)<note n="4" xml:id="d191fn4">

                    </p>
                    <p>The most important organizations working in the region, including the
                        Committee on the Caribbean and the Council of the Americas, have organized
                        an important conference on the Caribbean in Miami on November 28–30. If you
                        approve of the proposal described above, then we ought to try to key our
                        efforts to using that conference for launching this new initiative.
                        Specifically, we could begin with the following steps:</p>
                    <p>(1) Cy and I could meet informally with a core group of leaders of these
                        organizations to seek their views and encourage them to organize such an
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>(2) We would draft messages for you to send to the Presidents of countries in
                        the Caribbean Basin informing them of your idea for a people-to-people
                        approach and asking their views on whether they would consider such an
                        initiative helpful.</p>
                    <p>(3) On the eve of the Conference in the Caribbean, we could invite this
                        entire group to the White House for you to meet with them and launch the
                        Commission. The group could then use the Miami Conference, which will be
                        attended by a number of Heads of State and other leaders from the Caribbean,
                        to begin discussions, which would hopefully lead towards an overall plan for
                        helping the region.</p>
                    <p>(4) Since you cannot attend the Miami Conference, perhaps you could tape a
                        message which describes your policies and the people-to-people strategy, and
                        that could be used as the keynote to the Conference.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d191fn5">On November 28, in the Cabinet Room at the White House,
                            the President recorded a video-taped message for delegates attending the
                            Miami Conference on the Caribbean. For the text, see <hi rend="italic"
                                >Public Papers: Carter, 1979</hi>, Book II, pp. 2159–2161.</note>
                        (As an alternative, the Vice President could speak on your behalf.)</p>
                    <p>(5) Our Ambassadors from the Caribbean area will be attending a Chiefs of
                        Mission Conference in Washington on December 3rd and 4th. Perhaps they could
                        be invited to a brief reception at the White House, where you could
                        underscore your interest in the area.</p>
                    <p>(6) A Conference on Central America, which will be attended by leaders in the
                        area, will be held in New Orleans on February 28, and we could use that
                        event for the same purpose of mobilizing voluntary support.</p>
                    <p>These are some ideas for ways to get the people-to-people strategy moving.
                        While this will be very important as a means to show the peoples of the area
                        that the U.S. wants to help, we should not delude ourselves that more public
                        resources will not be required. Almost all of the key non-governmental
                        organizations, for example, the Partners <pb n="576" facs="0625"
                            xml:id="pg_576"/>of the Americas, were started by the government with
                        public aid, and while they have received an increasing amount of their funds
                        from private sources, they still receive government money. We will make
                        clear to them that little or no additional federal funds will be available
                        for expanded activities, but we may need to be flexible on this point.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                    <p>That you approve the proposal for a private, non-governmental organization to

                    <p rend="center">THE EXTENT OF ANTI-AMERICANISM ABROAD</p>
                    <p>In the absence of objective measurements there is a danger in the context of
                        current Iranian developments of coming to exaggerated conclusions as to the
                        extent of anti-Americanism abroad.</p>
                    <p>This is something that has been systematically monitored in the past, as may
                        be noted in the illustrative chart attached summarizing findings from a
                        worldwide survey conducted by the Agency some years ago in 22 countries and
                        major cities.<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">An unknown hand inserted “the”
                            before “past” and “be” before “noted.” Attached but not printed are two
                            charts entitled “General Feeling about the U.S.” and “Reactions to U.S.
                            Foreign Policies in General.” A typed notation at the bottom of the
                            first chart reads: “(from <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Report
                            R–176–65, ‛<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Standing in Worldwide
                            Public Opinion—1965’).”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The chart documents a widespread predominance of pro-American orientations,
                        even in Tehran. This is a pattern that has been repeatedly evidenced in
                        Agency surveys in scores of countries over the past many years. In short, it
                        is trite but true to say there has been a large reservoir of good will
                        toward the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> throughout the Free World.</p>
                    <p>While comparable trend measurements are lacking for recent years, the breadth
                        of positive indications in the past and their persistence through prior
                        periods of stress and strain in <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> relations
                        establish a high probability that pro-American orientations for the most
                        part continue to prevail.</p>
                    <p>Recent developments in Iran should not be permitted to obscure this
                        likelihood and lead to inflated conceptions of the extent of basic
                        anti-Americanism—even in Tehran itself. What may exist here is what is so
                        often the case, shrill elements of the public representing themselves as <hi
                            rend="italic">vox populi</hi>.</p>
                    <p>It is important to distinguish anti-Americanism from criticism of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> foreign policies. As may be noted from
                        comparisons of Chart I to Chart II, there is considerably more of the latter
                        than the former. So in general people can be critical of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policies without being basically unfavorable
                        in their opinion of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. More
                        specifically in the current context, this means that Iranians can be
                        critical of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy relating to the Shah
                        without being fundamentally anti-American.</p>
                    <pb n="578" facs="0627" xml:id="pg_578"/>
                    <p>Some of these points are obvious when spelled out but could easily be lost
                        sight of in the heat of the present crisis. They are therefore possibly
                        helpful reminders in any current efforts to assess the present extent of
                        anti-Americanism throughout the Free World.</p>

                    <p>Far more qualified minds than mine are no doubt addressing this problem at
                        the moment, but for what they may be worth, I share with you some
                        thoughts/suggestions which grow out of recent events in Islam and the risks
                        we now confront of a spillover effect throughout the lands of Islamic
                        allegiance. I am less concerned with immediate security concerns than the
                        longer-range problem of how our country will be perceived in that part of
                        the world. (C)</p>
                    <p>Assuming that the wave of anti-American expression we are now experiencing in
                        the Moslem community may not be short-lived—especially if the present crisis
                        in Iran is prolonged—and assuming too that any measures we take to deal with
                        the Iran situation will be exploited by our adversaries as anti-Islam, we
                        need to consider some prophylactic moves designed not only to contain <gloss

                        religious teachings and tradition. This should be both a short- and
                        longer-term effort. (C)</p>

                        concomitant of a nation and people whose own society was founded on

                    <p>Widespread political instability, caused by rapid economic and social change
                        exacerbated by Cuban activism, make the Caribbean and Central America of
                        particular concern to the United States. Our basic policy response is to

                    <p>Private people-to-people activities, and the unofficial and
                        extra-governmental relationships they create, already contribute importantly
                        to U.S. interests throughout the area. They can contribute even more through
                        improved coordination, focus and heightened visibility.</p>
                    <p>Our objectives therefore are to stimulate and encourage <gloss

                    <p>How can these objectives best be achieved? The President’s December 7 meeting
                        brought into clearer focus several important issues. Most of them should be
                        reviewed at the next meeting with <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss>
                        representatives.</p>
                    <p>We are also asking our Embassies to provide suggestions (without going to
                        host government officials) for increasing the acceptability and
                        effectiveness of our proposals.</p>

                    <p>Our role should be to help awaken <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVOs</gloss> to
                        the challenges, and to facilitate their work without undermining their

                    <p>Official actions must be carefully managed to avoid raising either
                        nationalist hackles in the region, or appearing to seek undue influence over
                        the <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVOs</gloss> themselves. This issue, in turn,
                        raises a number of operational questions:</p>
                    <p>—should there be a Presidential letter to Chiefs of State along the lines we

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations:</p>
                    <p>A. That we explicitly seek an authoritative sounding of opinion on this issue
                        at the next senior level meeting with <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss>
                        leaders.</p>
                    <p>B. That, unless <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss> or Embassy soundings are
                        negative, we provide initial encouragement to get the project off the ground
                        (possibly including a Presidential letter and/or announcement, or even a
                        government aircraft) <hi rend="italic">but</hi> make clear to everyone
                        concerned that subsequent activities will be purely private in nature,
                        designed to assist in achieving shared host country objectives.</p>
                    <p>C. That we not provide funding to U.S. agencies or private organizations for
                        this specific purpose. (Some individual <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss>
                        projects may, as now, qualify for U.S. support later.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Structure.</p>
                    <p>It is important to avoid the creation of new bureaucracies or layering. We
                        believe the most effective structure would be</p>
                    <p>—An umbrella group or “steering committee” made up of no more than 20 <gloss
                            target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss> leaders, to serve as a private
                        coordinating body for the overall effort. A few selected <gloss
                            target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> officials might be ex-officio members.</p>
                    <p>—Sub-groups, organized by country, to identify particular needs and stimulate
                        efforts to meet them. These U.S. <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss>
                        sub-groups might ultimately have local counterparts—but their chief function
                        would be to multiply the effects and impact of the steering group by
                        including knowledgeable individuals active in particular countries.</p>
                    <p>Depending on how the question of initial field consultations is resolved
                        (issue 6 below), steering group members might focus on consultations with
                        prospective “donors,” and subgroup members on those with “recipients.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> That this proposed structure be fully
                        reviewed at the next meeting with <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss>

                        process has been completed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Geographic Scope and Third Country
                        Involvement.</p>
                    <p>Countries in both Central America and the Caribbean should be included.</p>
                    <p>It would also be desirable to explore increased <gloss target="#t_PVO_1"
                            >PVO</gloss>-to-<gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss> contacts from other
                        major democratic countries of the Caribbean littoral—Mexico, Venezuela and
                        Colombia—as “donors.” These nations are active in the area, share similar
                        objectives with us and could contribute a multilateral dimension and closer
                        regional identification with the program, minimizing the stigma of U.S.
                        paternalism. We might also consider inclusion of Canada, which has strong
                        traditional ties with the English-speaking Caribbean.</p>

                    <p>Costa Rica, the Central American country with the strongest democratic and
                        local <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss> tradition, could play a pivotal
                        duel [<hi rend="italic">dual</hi>] role as both “donor” and “recipient.”</p>
                    <p>We do not know which countries might be receptive, but presume Venezuela will
                        be positive, that Colombia and Canada will be ambivalent while Mexico may be
                        reluctant.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> This approach should be discussed
                        with <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss> leaders. We are also seeking the

                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Program Emphasis</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Attempting to target this new effort toward specific U.S. objectives raises
                        several difficult questions:</p>
                    <p>—should priority attention be given to economic development, or to
                        participatory people-to-people activities, or both?</p>
                    <p>—would specific policy objectives increase the risk of foreign criticism of
                        U.S. paternalism or intervention so as to jeopardize program objectives?</p>
                    <p>—what range of activities would be easiest to stimulate and coordinate?</p>
                    <p>We anticipate that a broad, inclusive mandate would allow the greatest
                        latitude for achieving our objectives.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> We should spell out possible
                        objectives at the next meeting with private leaders, but should allow the

                        representatives of <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss>’s themselves. We
                        should include more currently active <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss>
                        leaders in the early planning stages to ensure future cooperation.</p>

                        be broadened to include more representation from the voluntary organizations

                    <p>Should we decide to also consult with possible “donor” countries, an early

                    <p>As noted above (issue 3), Costa Rica could play a key dual role and should

                        might travel together to a series of countries one after the other, possibly
                        by <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> aircraft. As this method would have
                        high visibility, limit length of visits, and possibly lack country expertise
                        in the composition of the delegation, an alternative approach might be to
                        have initial soundings undertaken by one or two selected <gloss
                            target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss> leaders for each country, travelling
                        commercially and taking the time to talk things through with their
                        counterparts. Subsequently, a consolidated report might be prepared for
                        discussion with the President.</p>

                    <p>There was some confusion as to whether the regional target for this effort is

                        and I agree with that. Unless you indicate otherwise, we will assume that
                        you feel the effort should be directed at Central America and the Caribbean,
                        and should to the extent possible, involve other basin countries like
                        Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico in the exchanges.<note n="3"

                        Government financial support at the beginning. This could be done by a grant
                        from <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> to a Commission Secretariat, which
                        would be the coordinating hub of the organization. We stressed your interest

                        tour by a group through the area in a Presidential plane.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d198fn5">The President placed a bracket in the right-hand margin

                        that. It seems to me that there are three objectives such a tour would be
                        designed to serve: (1) to establish if the host government is interested in
                        such a program; (2) to make contact with local groups and people; and (3) to
                        determine the kinds of needs which the program would aim to serve. We could
                        do the first by a letter from you, and the second and third could be
                        accomplished by either a low profile tour by a few members or by informal
                        discussions and contacts with government officials and local leaders.<note

                        existing organizations, or something more. His point is well taken, and I
                        recommend that we convey to the members that you view this effort as serving
                        three goals: (1) <hi rend="italic">attitude:</hi> improve mutual
                        understanding and appreciation through people-to-people exchanges; (2) <hi

                        nations of the region through small-scale and personal assistance efforts;
                        and (3) <hi rend="italic">democracy:</hi> to encourage political and
                        economic pluralism by working directly with private groups in the area in a
                        way which will lead them toward playing important roles in their societies.
                        To serve these goals, we hope to involve a wide range of groups and
                        leaders.</p>

                    <p>We have kept our Ambassadors informed of this idea and are seeking their
                        views on how to proceed. In the light of your comments on the conclusion of
                        the Caribbean Chiefs of Mission Conference, we will cable our Ambassadors
                        and make three points: (1) We ought to be looking for creative ways to
                        relate to Central America and the Caribbean, not just through traditional
                        aid instruments. (2) In a time of budgetary stringency, it is especially
                        important for us to look for ways to stretch our aid—make it more efficient
                        and effective. (3) We are examining the idea of an important
                        people-to-people program to the area. State is working hard on this
                        idea.</p>

                        sure that a cable is sent to our Ambassadors in the Caribbean and Central
                        America along the lines described above.<note n="7" xml:id="d198fn7">Below

                    <p>In <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s output on Iran—particularly to the

                        the real issue and must be released; 2) that the United States is pursuing
                        all peaceful and legal means to resolve the crisis; 3) that the
                        international community supports the United States; 4) that the American
                        society stands united in support of the President’s handling of the
                        crisis.</p>
                    <p>We are also trying to emphasize that 1) once the hostages are released, we
                        are prepared to listen to Iran’s grievances and 2) the prolongation of the
                        crisis is counter to Iran’s own interests and especially its revolutionary

                    </p>
                    <p>We have reviewed the emerging public environment in the Islamic countries,
                        set in train an assessment of our current communication efforts, and begun
                        to evolve an enhanced strategy for the long term (the principal first
                        elements of which are outlined at the conclusion of this memorandum). While
                        our focus has been on the area from the eastern Mediterranean littoral to
                        Bangladesh, much of the analysis and prescription holds for other Muslim
                        societies.</p>
                    <p>We have identified two phenomena which require urgent address, one short-term
                        and the other longer-term.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Short-term</hi>. Our posts have reported a nascent
                        perception among influential members of the Islamic world that the U.S. is
                        hostile to the whole of Islam, fails to distinguish adequately between
                        various manifestations of Islam in different countries and appears to
                        confuse the Ayatollah Khomeini and Shi’ism with Islam as a whole. The
                        problem is compounded by the tendency of U.S. news media and private
                        Americans to project this undifferentiated view of Islam. U.S. interests
                        will be served by projecting our appreciation of the fact that Islam takes
                        many forms, of which the Ayatollah is not a leading representative. <pb

                        phenomenon with which we are faced is a widespread “Third World” kind of
                        hostility to the developed nations in general and the U.S. in particular.
                        Islam complicates the problem, but is essentially an overlay taking
                        different manifestations in different countries, and therefore requiring a
                        differentiated response. Islam—as a religion—does not appear to us to be at
                        the heart of the matter. Specific policy differences (e.g., support of the
                        Shah or Israel) accentuate other sources of hostility to us.</p>

                        serious religion, many (but not all) of whose values we share; a principal
                        purpose of this continuing discourse will be to expand awareness of

                        individuals in the context of recent events. We have asked for a report by
                        February 1.</p>
                    <pb n="593" facs="0642" xml:id="pg_593"/>
                    <p>2) We are developing, and hope to have in place shortly, variants on
                        traditional exchanges activities which would involve religious/intellectual
                        leaders from Muslim countries in much more directly value-centered
                        discussions with American counterparts both in the U.S. and abroad. To the
                        degree present funding is inadequate, we will reprogram internally.</p>
                    <p>3) We will be meeting this month with the Directors of the 11 <gloss
                            target="#t_NDEA_1">NDEA</gloss> language/area studies centers at
                        American universities to explore the possibilities of mutual assistance in
                        this current effort, to elicit their views as to new public diplomacy
                        initiatives, to create joint research possibilities focussed on the
                        psychological environment in the Muslim world as it may affect our
                        operations, and to encourage them to expand their own contacts. <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> participation in that meeting would be
                        welcomed.</p>
                    <p>4) There are over 100,000 Muslim students in the U.S. We are exploring ways
                        of enhancing the probability that their experiences here will contribute to
                        the objectives outlined above in this memorandum.</p>
                    <p>5) We are reviewing our internal training/assignment procedures to enhance
                        the language and area competence of our personnel overseas.</p>
                    <p>6) As our posts abroad head into the next planning cycle we are directing
                        them to focus much more explicitly on both the long and short-term
                        objectives outlined above, to redirect resources and activities where
                        indicated and to make recommendations for enhanced or improved support from
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> Washington.</p>
                    <p>7) We have created an Agency task group, including <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> and other media, to assure continuing, policy-sensitive
                        coverage responsive to our objectives.</p>
                    <p>8) We believe the national interest would be well served by a close
                        review—perhaps to be conducted cooperatively by the Departments of State and
                        Defense, and representatives of the private sector—of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >private</hi> American presence in key countries such as Saudi Arabia.
                        That presence was, in both quality and quantity, a liability in Iran and may
                        prove to be elsewhere as well. We recommend the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> initiate such an effort, in which we would be pleased to
                        participate.</p>
                    <p>9) Finally, we recommend renewed consideration of the recommendations from
                        the President’s Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies.
                        Funds available to increase the competence of Americans to deal with
                        international problems are grossly inadequate to the need; many of the
                        report’s recommendations made good sense even before Iran and Afghanistan;
                        they make better sense now.</p>

                    <p>It’s good to be among colleagues; the snatches of conversation and discussion
                        I’ve heard here today are familiar—and heartening—<pb n="597" facs="0646"
                            xml:id="pg_597"/>to someone who’s been engaged in this work at home and
                        abroad for over twenty years. Your expertise and professionalism go without
                        saying; it’s your continued enthusiasm that gives me a real lift. I’m
                        grateful and impressed.</p>
                    <p>As you know, the convention at workshops like this is for the guest speaker
                        to congratulate the participants and tell them that their hard work does not
                        go unappreciated. I certainly don’t intend to break that convention. But I
                        must, at the outset, make a further statement: without your efforts, my
                        agency would simply fall down on the job. Our partnerships—the many
                        partnerships represented here at this workshop—are <hi rend="italic"
                            >essential</hi> to the U.S. International Communication Agency’s mission
                        and to its institutional life. That’s a plain fact. And it’s as sound a
                        foundation as I can think of for my brief remarks here today.</p>
                    <p>You’re all familiar with—and you share in carrying out—<gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>’s mission, which in its simplest terms,
                        is to encourage the sharing of ideas and experience between the people of
                        the United States and the people of other nations, with the object of
                        increasing mutual understanding. Our charter—drawn up by the President and
                        sanctioned by the Congress—states explicitly that it is in the national
                        interest to do this.<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">See <ref target="#d93"
                                >Documents 93</ref> and <ref target="#d121">121</ref>.</note> Later
                        in the month I will ask the Congress to appropriate almost 460 million
                        dollars of the taxpayers’ money to carry out this charter.</p>
                    <p>Before <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> was created, most of you worked
                        with the State Department on exchange-of-persons programs designed to
                        increase mutual understanding among peoples, and you had at least some
                        knowledge of the part played by U.S. Information Agency officers abroad in
                        administering these same programs. So I won’t go into any organizational
                        history except to make three points, which I believe are especially
                        important today:</p>
                    <p>First, the importance of exchange programs—genuine two-way communication
                        between Americans and people of other societies and cultures—was recognized
                        from the beginning as too great to be entrusted solely to Government
                        functionaries. Private-sector partnership remains a necessity to <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>;</p>
                    <p>Second, the old <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and the Department’s
                        Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs worked harmoniously and
                        effectively together for many years on exchange matters in spite of
                        enormous, and sometimes absurd, bureaucratic obstacles;</p>
                    <p>Third, for 30 years exchange programs existed together with other
                        educational, cultural and information activities, often through periods of
                        international stress, division and bloodshed, without external or internal
                        compromise to their integrity.</p>
                    <pb n="598" facs="0647" xml:id="pg_598"/>
                    <p>We’re looking at a very grim world today, but not an impossible one. I
                        believe that the present international convulsions and confrontations
                        underscore the need for these efforts at mutual understanding that we call
                        public diplomacy, and with which you and I are intimately concerned. I’ve
                        just come back this week from a trip to China and the Philippines. In Manila
                        I met with our Public Affairs Officers from 14 countries in the Far East.
                        Over the past critical weeks, these <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>
                        officers have been engaged in explaining our country’s policies and
                        clarifying America’s intentions and reactions in regard to Iran and
                        Afghanistan, as completely and as thoughtfully as they could. At the same
                        time, scholars, professional people, community leaders from those countries
                        have been <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, seeing for themselves the public
                        mood, and the knowledge—or lack of it—of international issues reflected by
                        their American hosts. These visitors have been explaining their own points
                        of view and their judgments as interested members of other societies to whom
                        the present international crises may have other implications.</p>
                    <p>I might add that what is most important in each of these efforts at
                        communication is not just the assurance or warning of the moment, but the
                        achievement of as accurate an understanding as possible of the social and
                        cultural context in which the conversation takes place.</p>
                    <p>I have been thinking about my trip to the Far East, and about the tensions
                        emanating from Southwest Asia, in connection with my appearance before the
                        Senate Appropriations Committee on the 20th of this month.<note n="3"

                        mind wonderfully.”</p>
                    <p>What have our efforts at cross-cultural communication done for us in Iran or
                        Afghanistan? In other parts of the world, have our exchange-of-persons
                        programs, our radio broadcasts on the Voice of America, our speakers and
                        seminars on economic and social subjects, our exhibits of painting and
                        sculpture, tempered the international climate to any appreciable degree?</p>
                    <p>After 40 years of official international visitor programs, do we—in
                        government or politics or private institutions of influence—have a better
                        understanding of others’ aspirations or fears or perspectives on the
                        world—an understanding that moderates our national behavior or
                        comprehension?</p>
                    <p>The answers to these questions are immensely more important than the 460
                        million dollars they’re associated with this year. And they’re questions
                        which you, more than anybody, know must be <pb n="599" facs="0648"
                            xml:id="pg_599"/>answered—at least to a certain extent—on faith. We in
                        America must believe in the possibility of rational discourse. We must
                        believe that mutual understanding between peoples can actually be arrived
                        at. The alternative is too terrible to contemplate.</p>
                    <p>But we can buttress our faith with intelligent and worthwhile programs, like
                        the ones you work with every day.</p>
                    <p>—Influential international visitors from Yemen, Morocco and Oman, programmed
                        by <gloss target="#t_VPS_1">VPS</gloss>, will take part in a seminar on
                        Islam and the Modern World this weekend, jointly sponsored by American
                        University and the Islamic Center. We can assume that they will make
                        significant contributions to American understanding, and in the process,
                        contribute to an actual lessening of political and social frictions among
                        international opinion-makers.</p>
                    <p>—Last summer, nine young film-makers from five Arab countries toured the
                        United States from coast to coast by van and station wagon, in a program
                        arranged with the Academy for Educational Development. What they learned
                        about the United States is bound to have an effect on their work and
                        attitudes well beyond the techniques of documentary film-making. An <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> officer accompanying them saw—as you so
                        often do with international visitors—a dramatic lessening of suspicion, an
                        increasing warmth of response, as these intensely political, culturally
                        defensive professional communicators saw that the trip <hi rend="italic"
                            >was</hi> open, that they were not being guided toward conclusions or
                        shielded from controversy.</p>
                    <p>—A glance at the arrival lists of international visitors shows economists,
                        labor leaders, orchestra conductors, parliamentarians, university lecturers,
                        business executives, playwrights, being given this same open
                        experience—unique, I believe, to America—through the good offices and sure
                        professional touch of <gloss target="#t_AAI_1">AAI</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_IIE_1">IIE</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_VPS_1">VPS</gloss>, The
                        Labor Department, the Office of Education, Commerce, Defense, <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, our own voluntary visitor office and
                        others represented in this room. And you know, despite the headaches and
                        frustrations, the occasional impossible personality, that the programs
                        work—they do achieve and increase mutual understanding.</p>
                    <p>If I have one policy point to make today, it is that our mutual endeavors to
                        create understanding through international visitor programs, exchanges of
                        scholars and artists, through discussions and seminars, through reasoned
                        explication and sensitive listening, are most effective and meaningful when
                        they are all actively engaged in multiple and continuous communication.</p>
                    <p>I have been worried about the tendency of people inside and outside <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> to see it as having a split personality,
                        with one soft, rather slow-moving cultural side, and one brisk, somewhat
                        argumentative information side. It just isn’t so. These facets of
                        communication—some <pb n="600" facs="0649" xml:id="pg_600"/>more resonant
                        than others—are all parts of a whole. To characterize them as long-range or
                        short-range, one-way or two-way, as cultural or informational, is to
                        stereotype and diminish them. What characterizes communication is the use to
                        which it’s put, by both sender and receiver, not the means of communication
                        itself. You could, if you chose, manipulate an exchange visit as easily as
                        we could fashion a tendentious message for the Voice of America. None of us
                        can, even if we choose, communicate only one message at a time.</p>
                    <p>At times of international crisis, people tend to simplify issues, and to
                        split them into “either-or” alternatives, often along “hawk” and “dove”
                        lines. A quick look at the papers these days will bear this out; either we
                        take one of a series of actions in Iran or Afghanistan, or we take another
                        series of actions.</p>
                    <p>The “either-or” approach to international relations may have its value—in
                        clearing the ambiguities from proposed actions or in sharpening distinctions
                        between policy options, for example—but one institution at least would be
                        very badly served by “either-or” divisions, or ideological cleavages among
                        its components or partners. That, of course, is <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >USICA</gloss>. This brings me to the policy point about public
                        diplomacy and its future that I want to leave with you. If we are going to
                        strengthen—truly strengthen—mutual understanding between peoples, and if we
                        are truly going to strengthen rationality in international dialogue, we must
                        use wisely all the means of communication at our disposal. Those of us who
                        work in educational and cultural exchanges should see the <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> news and commentary as in a sense
                        extensions of our own activities, with all the critical interest and concern
                        that that implies. And the press officer in a post abroad who enunciates
                        official U.S. policy, should understand that the <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName> and international visitor
                        programs provide increasing numbers of his audiences with background and
                        experience of our culture which brings that policy into perspective. We must
                        not only recognize the connections among the various channels of
                        communication we use as practitioners of public diplomacy—official and
                        unofficial—we must be aware that their complexities enrich the process, at
                        the same time they defy manipulation.</p>
                    <p>Two years ago, when <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> was being
                        organized and the international atmosphere was fairly calm, there were fears
                        among people concerned with the State Department’s educational and cultural
                        exchange programs that these activities might be politicized by any
                        institutional links with the government’s overseas information and cultural
                        programs. I think most now agree that these fears have not been realized.
                        Now, with <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> established and the
                        international atmosphere at the boiling point, I hear from some that the
                        Agency’s information function—the clear enunciation and explanation to the
                        world of American policy and opinion—might be dissipated by <pb n="601"
                            facs="0650" xml:id="pg_601"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>’s emphasis on educational and
                        cultural-exchange matters. I think this, too, is an unnecessary fear.</p>
                    <p>“Either-or” just does not apply to our business. We are obligated to listen,
                        to contribute to what is known in the exchanges community as the “American
                        Learning Experience,” and we are bound, in our two-way communication, to
                        reflect the plurality of American culture. But as the official component of
                        this country’s public diplomacy, supported by tax dollars, we cannot cut
                        ourselves loose from policy. Nor, in its day, could the Bureau of
                        Educational and Cultural Affairs.</p>
                    <p>Public diplomacy, skillfully and responsibly practiced, is necessary and
                        beneficial to the conduct of our international affairs. It is a counter to
                        the surges of irrationality and rage in the world which are activated by
                        ignorance and misapprehension.</p>
                    <p>And the exchange programs are a primary ingredient of public diplomacy. In my
                        view, they have never been more vital than now. I say this not out of any
                        naive belief that exchanges are a panacea for the world’s problems; yet no
                        foreign policy can be wholly realistic or complete which does not try to
                        bring together, across frontiers, people who honestly want to learn from and
                        about one another.</p>
                    <p>Many of you have heard what purports to be an ancient Chinese curse: “May you
                        live in interesting times.” We are certainly so cursed, and so
                        privileged.</p>
                    <p>As a remarkable blend of personal convictions and professional goals, this
                        workshop represents an active partnership and a pledge for the future—in
                        interesting times. I am proud to be a part of it.</p>

                    <p>Surveys taken in December 1979 by <persName corresp="#p_GGH_1"
                            >Gallup</persName> Institutes in 22 countries reveal a wide variation in
                        the extent to which prospects for 1980 were viewed as likely to be better or
                        worse than in 1979. The popular mood ranged from a 66 to 16 percent
                        predominance of pessimistic over optimistic expectations among the British,
                        to a 60 to 13 percent predominance of optimism among South Koreans (Table
                            1).<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">Attached but not printed is an undated

                            1980.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> is among those countries with a marked
                        predominance of pessimism, with a 56 percent majority who viewed prospects
                        for 1980 as worse than 1979 compared to 31 percent who viewed them as better
                        (13 percent said “the same” or gave no opinion). Other countries with a
                        large margin of pessimism were Austria, India, Italy and Canada.</p>
                    <p>There was a notable concentration of Latin American nations among countries
                        registering predominant optimism, with Uruguay, Mexico and Venezuela
                        trailing only South Korea in the extent of optimistic sentiment. Chile was
                        also predominantly optimistic, though by a lesser margin, and only Brazil
                        fell short of clearly preponderant optimism.</p>
                    <p>Viewed as a group, the countries surveyed display a remarkably balanced
                        distribution with the number of predominantly pessimistic countries
                        equalling those predominantly optimistic. That the overall balance at the
                        opening of the eighties is at an approximate standoff thus gives the
                        advantage neither to prophets of doom who look for prevailing pessimism or
                        to those of opposite persuasion.</p>
                    <p>While the study did not explore respondents’ reasons for expressing optimism
                        vs. pessimism about 1980, questions were asked on economic expectations of
                        prosperity and political expectations of a peaceful year. The findings shed
                        considerable light on why Great Britain leads all the countries surveyed in
                        pessimism, an historic high for Great Britain in annual surveys extending
                        back to 1957. The fact is that both <pb n="603" facs="0652" xml:id="pg_603"
                        />adverse economic and political expectations were also at or near historic
                        highs in the current survey.</p>
                    <p>The results of the supplementary queries also suggest why South Koreans came
                        out so high in optimism since they emerged as second highest among the
                        nations surveyed in anticipations of economic prosperity.</p>
                    <p>In light of the British and Korean findings, a special analysis was pursued
                        of the relationships between general optimism/pessimism and
                        economic/international political expectations. The results showed that
                        country variations in popular mood are closely associated with variations in
                        economic expectations but have no discernable association with political
                        expectations. More specifically, it was found that in countries where the
                        population is less pessimistic about future <hi rend="italic">economic</hi>
                        prospects one finds people to be <hi rend="italic">generally</hi> more
                        optimistic.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Trend in Optimism vs. Pessimism</p>
                    <p>When the popular mood as measured in the latest <persName corresp="#p_GGH_1"
                            >Gallup</persName> surveys is compared to expressions of optimism and
                        pessimism registered a year earlier in some 19 countries, a marked downward
                        trend is found. There have been substantial declines in the margin of
                        optimism over pessimism in 11 countries as against, at most, slight
                        increases in only two. (Table 2)<note n="3" xml:id="d204fn3">Attached but
                            not printed is an undated table entitled “Table 2. Trend in
                            Optimism-Pessimism About Prospects for 1979 and 1980.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>This is a major shift downward in the course of a year. So while in the
                        latest measurements neither optimism nor pessimism have won out in the
                        overall balance among the countries represented, if present trends continue
                        one must definitely expect an emerging tilt to the pessimistic side in
                        worldwide expressions of popular mood.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to note that there has been virtually no change in
                        expressions of optimism versus pessimism among Americans in expectations for
                        1979 as compared for those in 1980. In both years there is a clear margin of
                        pessimism with the majority expecting things to get worse. In contrast,
                        among the British there has been a very large shift in viewpoint from what
                        was a slight margin of pessimism in the prior survey to what is currently
                        the largest margin for any of the countries surveyed. Similarly, in India
                        there has been a very large shift toward pessimism in the current
                        survey.</p>
                    <p>That the popular mood has been trending sharply downward over the past year
                        and that pessimism already prevails by large margins in not a few countries
                        would seem to have serious implications for political communication.
                        Political leaders in spelling out the sacrifices that <pb n="604"

                    <p>I am responding to your memo of May 30.<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d206">Document 206</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>We continue to play the Cuban refugee issue heavily in all our media and
                        through our posts abroad. Since April 4 our press service has provided posts
                        with over 200 texts of policy statements, stories, interviews with refugees,
                        background on Cuba and the like. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        remains heavily on the case, and all of its Cuban coverage has also been
                        placed on its correspondent feed which services over 2,500 indigenous radio
                        stations throughout Latin America.</p>
                    <p>We are using the themes developed by the inter-agency group and are actively
                        working with other agencies to develop supporting factual material for our
                        media.</p>
                    <p>To assist these efforts, and to capitalize on the refugees, we are now
                        producing a film which will tell the story of life in Cuba as the refugees
                        themselves experienced it. We have filmed interviews with Cubans in the
                        Florida camps. I’m told it is powerful material. The film itself will be
                        ready for distribution by mid-June.</p>
                    <p>We have given considerable thought to your staff’s proposal that <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> produce a daily one-hour program on Cuba
                        for broadcast simultaneously to Cuba and other countries. The question of
                        costs aside, we conclude: (1) Cubans know more than we can tell them about
                        Cuba; (2) both commercial radios and <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        are already getting a heavy message into Cuba about refugee reception here
                        and their views as to why they left; (3) audiences elsewhere will quickly
                        conclude that a packaged program on Cuba is propaganda and tune it out; (4)
                        that our best hope <pb n="610" facs="0659" xml:id="pg_610"/>of keeping Cuba
                        in the minds of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> audiences is to insert
                        the story into programs to which they are drawn for other reasons.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has been working with elements of the
                        Department of Defense to assure that it is technically feasible to use
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>-furnished mediumwave transmitters
                        to get an effective <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> signal into the
                        eastern Caribbean. I am told that they have almost concluded their technical
                        studies, which look like being positive. Cost estimates are being developed.
                        If the project appears practicable (and we should know next week), the next
                        step will be to survey the U.S. Navy base on Antigua which appears to be the
                        only feasible site, then consult with the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                        and the Antiguans.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I would like to flag one matter for <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> attention. Your staff will recall that well before the
                        refugee issue arose, we were instructed by the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> to develop a cultural exchange attraction to tour Cuba.

                            conclusion from those memos that major cultural presentations are
                            reserved for democratic countries with which we have excellent
                            relations.” He commented that he never understood this to be the case,
                            adding: “I had always thought we were interested in reaching out to

                    <p>Your arguments for not considering a daily one-hour program on Cuba are good
                        ones, but frankly I am not persuaded. I do not agree, for example, that: (1)
                        the information that we have available on Cuban activities abroad and on
                        developments within Cuba is available to the Cuban population; (2) that this
                        information is already being received in Cuba as a result of <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and commercial radio broadcasting;(3) that
                        audiences tune out propaganda or that accurate and credible information,
                        which presumably would characterize the one-hour program, constitutes
                        propaganda; and (4) if this were the case, then why <pb n="612" facs="0661"
                            xml:id="pg_612"/>would Cuba and the Soviet Union spend so much money
                        broadcasting throughout the area and the world? I do think it is useful to
                        insert Cuban-related material in regular programs, and I believe that <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is doing a good job at that, but I also
                        think we would be better served by a daily one-hour program on the subject.

                        is an unusually balanced and readable report on a complex project. “Books
                        and Broadcasting for Children” was <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>’s
                        major contribution to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>-designated
                        International Year of the Child.</p>
                    <p>The project is worth reviewing for several reasons. Its genesis and funding
                        required support and approval by the Director. It was exceedingly effective
                        in building bridges to interested American private sectors (35 groups and
                        private sector institutions were ultimately allied with <gloss

                            SYMPOSIUM</p>
                        <p>What became <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>’s major program effort
                            for the International Year of the Child (<gloss target="#t_IYC_1"
                                >IYC</gloss>) began with two separate grant proposals received by
                            Private Sector Programs (then <gloss target="#t_ECAIP_1">ECA/IP</gloss>)
                            in 1978. Both were concerned with media activities aimed at children.
                            The first originated with <persName corresp="#p_HV_1">Virginia
                                Haviland</persName>, Director of the Library of Congress Children’s
                            Literature Center, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJ_1">John
                                Donovan</persName>, Executive Secretary of the Children’s Book
                            Council. They asked grant funding to bring international authors,
                            librarians and books to the attention of American librarians and
                            educators through regional workshops, media participation and public
                            presentations. They were interested in both authors of printed works and
                            in those involved in preserving the oral traditions in children’s
                            literature prevalent in much of the developing world.</p>
                        <p>The second proposal came from <persName corresp="#p_TC_1">Cecily
                                Truett</persName>, a young <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>
                            producer who had just completed a successful public television series
                            STUDIO SEE<note n="3" xml:id="d209fn3">Children’s magazine-style
                                television program, produced by South Carolina Educational

                                target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> Network. Additionally, she had
                            participated in the Munich PRIX JEUNESSE<note n="4" xml:id="d209fn4"
                                >Biennial international children’s television festival.</note> and
                            had developed many international contacts in children’s television
                            programming. She wished to establish a private international body to
                            promote higher standards and international exchanges of children’s
                                <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> programs of an educational,
                            cultural and entertainment character. The first step would be a “model”
                            international conference on children’s <gloss target="#t_TV_1"
                                >TV</gloss> programming. Ms. <persName corresp="#p_TC_1"
                                >Truett</persName> also believed she could obtain financial support
                            from other sectors. <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> staff members
                            were intrigued with the proposal, feeling that the new Agency could play
                            a role in such a pilot project which involved both education and
                            international dialogue. However, they made three stipulations: (1) find
                            a <gloss target="#t_PBS_1">PBS</gloss> station willing to collaborate;
                            (2) get an international commitment; (3) enlarge the project to include
                            a children’s literature component.</p>

                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> was represented on the
                            Interagency Council for the International Year of the Child by <persName
                                corresp="#p_HA_1">Anthony Hackley</persName>, Program Development
                            Officer (<gloss target="#t_PGMD_1">PGM/D</gloss>). The Agency had no
                            plans at that time for formal programs in connection with the event, and
                                <gloss target="#t_IYC_1">IYC</gloss> was not included in Agency
                            Country Plans. However, <persName corresp="#p_MMK_1">Mildred
                                Marcy</persName>, then Director of Institutional Relations (<gloss
                                target="#t_ECAI_1">ECA/I</gloss>) and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BW_1">Wilbur Blume</persName>, Program Officer, saw
                            unique and innovative possibilities for <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                                >USICA</gloss> through some combination of the two projects, plus
                            added possibilities in accomplishing it during <gloss target="#t_IYC_1"
                                >IYC</gloss>. Among those opportunities were the following:</p>
                        <p>1. It would be an excellent chance to work with the domestic constituency
                                <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> had been mandated to
                            develop.</p>
                        <p>2. Cooperation with the Interagency Committee on <gloss target="#t_IYC_1"
                                >IYC</gloss> would be good interagency politics and could contribute
                            to the success of future programming.</p>
                        <p>3. A project combining media with education concepts was clearly suited
                            to <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. If the applicants could obtain other funding, it would be an excellent
                            test of joint funding concepts.</p>
                        <p>By December, 1978, Ms. <persName corresp="#p_TC_1">Truett</persName> had
                            managed to persuade WPBT–<gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>, Miami,
                            South Florida’s Educational <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> outlet,
                            to co-sponsor her proposal. She also got a commitment from PRIX JEUNESSE
                            of <gloss target="#t_DM_1">DM</gloss> 10,000 (which was later
                            withdrawn), plus commitments from the Boston Book Council and the
                            Children’s Literature Section of the Library of Congress. Accordingly,
                            she and Ms. <persName corresp="#p_HV_1">Haviland</persName> met with
                                <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> personnel to discuss a joint
                            project. At this point Ms. <persName corresp="#p_HV_1"
                                >Haviland</persName> withdrew, suggesting that the Association for
                            Library Service to Children (<gloss target="#t_ALSC_1">ALSC</gloss>), a
                            division of the American Library Association (<gloss target="#t_ALA_1"
                                >ALA</gloss>) be invited to participate instead. <gloss

                                corresp="#p_AMJ_1">Mary Jane Anderson</persName> discussed the

                                corresp="#p_TC_1">Truett</persName> in Washington in late 1978. The
                            rough working draft of their two proposals became “BOOKS AND
                            BROADCASTING FOR CHILDREN: An International Symposium.”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE</p>
                        <p>The basic concept was that since books in translation, as well as radio
                            and <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> signals, transcend national
                            boundaries, it was especially important and beneficial to bring together
                            professionals in both fields from a variety of geographic and cultural
                            backgrounds to let them discover and explore ways of contributing to the
                            enrichment and improvement of each other’s work. Such a meeting could
                            also focus on the need for a more universal interpretation of children’s
                            media made inevitable by impending technological change. The Books and
                            Broadcasting Symposium would assemble 30 professionals, equally divided
                            between print and broadcast media, for a 36-day period to <pb n="615"
                                facs="0664" xml:id="pg_615"/>identify and discuss their common
                            problems with possible solutions, to prepare a workshop production
                            demonstrating steps taken in translating print literature to the
                            broadcast medium, and to share their knowledge and experiences with U.S.
                            professionals. The dates were set—September 13–October 19, 1979. As it
                            eventually developed, the Symposium was to begin with seminars for the
                            entire group in Boston, New York and Washington, to take advantage of
                            the number of experts present in those centers. The participants would
                            then divide into small groups following <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                                >USICA</gloss>’s International Visitor format, and visit other areas
                            of the United States, with itineraries suggested by their individual
                            needs and suggestions made by members of <gloss target="#t_ALSC_1"
                                >ALSC</gloss> and the educational broadcasters. The group would
                            reassemble in Miami for the final workshop production and evaluation.
                            The candidates selected were to be nationally recognized leaders
                            concerned with these media and their implementation for children, or

                            all seminar cities and arranged for participants. Through their own
                            professional networks, they tailored the grantees’ itineraries during
                            the small group phase. They also called <pb n="617" facs="0666"
                                xml:id="pg_617"/>upon these professionals to act as volunteer
                            hostesses in many cities, asking them to coordinate their activities
                            with those of the <gloss target="#t_IVS_1">IVS</gloss> volunteer
                            network. With so many people sharing the action, firm control and
                            constant communication was necessary. All planners were involved in

                        <p>The staff realized that the participants would not know each other at the
                            start, nor would the broadcasters necessarily be knowledgeable about the
                            book field (and vice versa). Neither were they likely to be aware of
                            differences in development levels. Time must also be allowed for sharing
                            the videotapes, books, and other materials the grantees had been urged
                            to bring along. Sightseeing had to be arranged, plus “personal” and
                            “rest” times. The programs had to be divided as equally as possible
                            between print and broadcast media, and not all the time given to
                            lectures.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS:</p>
                        <p>With so many opposites and experiments involved, the possibilities for
                            misunderstandings were built in. For starters, there was the fact that
                            it was the first time that two traditionally rival media had been asked
                            to cooperate for a period of time on a single project. Certainly it was
                            the first time such a linkage was established in the field of children’s
                            literature. Adding an international element intensified problem areas.
                            The children’s literature grantees were generally older and in some
                            cases more mature than their broadcast colleagues. Furthermore, in
                            dealing with their U.S. counterparts in the industry, many <pb n="618"
                                facs="0667" xml:id="pg_618"/>remarked that the children’s literature
                            professionals were child-oriented, while the broadcast professionals
                            were largely working in an adult-oriented world. There was almost
                            universal complaint by the literature professionals that more time was
                            spent on broadcasting activities. To some extent, the verdict is “guilty
                            as charged,” but then it simply takes more time to see a videotape or
                            listen to a radio tape, while a book may be satisfactorily skimmed by a
                            rapid reader. And some of the broadcast time included exploration into
                            media interrelation, such as trips to the Weston Woods Studios<note
                                n="8" xml:id="d209fn8">Established by Morton Schindel, Wilton Woods

                            Connecticut, and the Miami WPBT–<gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>
                            workshop itself.</p>
                        <p>The participants were asked to evaluate the conference and to list the
                            most positive experiences, the least positive, plus suggestions for
                            future conferences:</p>
                        <p>1. At the top of this list was the personal interaction across cultures
                            and disciplines, coupled with the opportunity to examine education
                            through mass media. The participants also enjoyed their visits to

                                xml:id="d209fn11">Reference is to Fred Rogers, creator and host of
                                the educational television program “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood,” which
                                debuted on the <gloss target="#t_NET_1">NET</gloss> network (later
                                    <gloss target="#t_PBS_1">PBS</gloss>) in February 1968. Rogers
                                produced the program at the WQED public television station in
                                Pittsburgh.</note> in Pittsburgh. It appears that while there may
                            have well been some complaints about the division of time, the
                            audio-visual events were among the favorites.</p>
                        <p>2. There were complaints that the program was overcrowded, with
                            insufficient time for rest or sightseeing. Additionally, there were
                            comments that the symposium showed a lack of definition or focus.</p>
                        <p>3. The primary suggestion was that the “sharing” take place at the
                            beginning and not the end.</p>
                        <p>Participants had been asked to bring books, videotapes and other examples
                            of their work with them. These were not viewed until the end of the
                            conference. (One reason for the delay was that meeting facilities in the
                            Boston hotel were found to be inadequate.) Admittedly there were
                            technical problems connected with the projection of video<pb n="619"
                                facs="0668" xml:id="pg_619"/>tapes; (i.e., different scanning
                            systems had to be used for examplars from different nations). But, had
                            the group been aware at the outset of general conditions in
                            participating nations, discussions and indeed, the dynamics of the
                            entire group, could have been different. Another suggestion was that the
                            literature professionals be given more briefings on the technical
                            problems of translating books to electronic media. Still another was
                            that the schedule be less crowded, leaving time for more group
                            interaction.</p>
                        <p>A particularly thoughtful critique came from participant Keith
                            Tyler-Smith of South Pacific Television, Christchurch, New Zealand. He
                            immediately commented that the time factor is particularly critical for
                            such important professionals; he recommended a 14–21-day symposium for
                            future projects. He also stressed that the factor most lacking “seemed
                            to be a coherent overview of why the symposium was being organized and
                            what were the objectives and how best could they be achieved.” He
                            believed this fault lay in the dual responsibility and authority of the
                            directors. (There will be further observations on this theme.)</p>
                        <p>Rukanuzzaman Khan, participant from Bangladesh wrote, “We have been
                            especially moved to see the session on story telling for pre-school
                            children in the children’s section of the public libraries. On my return
                            to Bangladesh, I have been trying to introduce the same system in the
                            libraries run by the Central Kachi Manchar Mela.” He further commented
                            on the initial lack of “sharing time.” Also, he remarked that except for
                            an incident in Indianapolis, there had been no opportunity to meet with
                            children on a personal level. He ended his evaluation with the statement
                            that the authorities of Bangladesh television had “warmly welcomed” a
                            proposal to exchange children’s programs with other nations, and the
                            hope that such a project would be successful.</p>

                            Padilla was also impressed with the use of a story-teller for <gloss
                                target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> and radio and he felt that using a
                            story-teller in libraries <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-style would
                            encourage children to read. He also said he had made many useful
                            contacts with Americans and his conference colleagues, which he planned
                            to follow up at the 1980 World Conference of Librarians in Manila. He
                            said that he “came away with the experience with the idea that
                            broadcasting can complement reading activities to enhance learning and
                            likewise books can provide a reiterative effect to broadcasting.” He
                            described the whole program “as one of the bright pages of my life.”</p>

                        <p>Several points in these reports were significant. The escort for
                            participants from Bulgaria, Australia, Sweden noted, “The three were
                            ideal grantees, competent, articulate, interested in everything. They
                            related to each other exceptionally well. . . .” The escort also noted
                            that they would have preferred a <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>
                            project, and found some of the literature aspects “irrelevant.” This is
                            further evidence of the occasional tensions between these
                            traditionally-rival groups.</p>
                        <p>Another escort underlined their stay in Madison, Wisconsin, as
                            particularly outstanding because of a visit with a producer of films
                            based on traditional children’s stories from around the world, a tour of
                            an “open” school, and exposure to the Children’s Television Channel,
                            where children use the equipment. Each adult was then interviewed by a
                            child reporter. The escort also remarked that the <gloss
                                target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> people acutely felt the lack of an
                            international organization and strongly desired forming one.</p>
                        <p>A third escort raved, “These visitors were the most delightful persons I
                            have escorted. All three felt honored to visit here. . . . There seemed
                            to be no jealous feelings that the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>
                            is far advanced—only admiration. Where they thought the <gloss

                            by not doing the same.”</p>

                            that more than 300 of its members had contact with at least one of the

                        <p>In rural Arkansas, some of the Symposium participants rode a Bookmobile
                            and were able to talk with Americans far off the usual <gloss

                            sandwiches from a country store and talked with children from a nearby
                            school who had come to get books. The librarians involved asked, “Please
                            let us know when you have more coming this way.” The Little Rock Council
                            for International Visitors wrote to thank the <gloss target="#t_ALSC_1"

                            sisters, my other selves. They have made me feel that our conspiracy to
                            bring books and children together is a global one, and that it is an
                            awesome undertaking. . . .”</p>
                        <p>From a librarian in Cleveland: “. . . the program seems to all of us here
                            who had a part in it to be a valid one, with great potential for more
                            interchange between librarians and broadcasters, Americans and their

                        <p>There was extremely positive reaction from U.S. broadcasters who had come
                            in contact with the Symposium. From Boston, the Executive Producer for

                            September 19th, WGBH hosted a day long conference for this impressive
                            group of international visitors. The seminar was attended by many of our
                            WGBH staff, as well as special guests from the Boston Community. We all
                            welcomed the chance to be part of an international exchange of ideas
                            between those who care deeply about children and the media designed for
                            them. Indeed, it is clear that the more we can communicate ideas and
                            values internationally, the stronger radio and television we will all be
                            able to produce for children.”<note n="15" xml:id="d209fn15">Not

                            because they are not accustomed to writing, not because they are less

                                <persName corresp="#p_AMJ_1">Mary Jane Anderson</persName>, with
                            Nancy Buttermark of <gloss target="#t_VPS_1">VPS</gloss>. Each was
                            protecting her own interests as she saw them, which left ample space for
                            battles over territory. Luckily, the most serious battle came quite
                            early in the trip, involving the role of the American participants. Ms.
                            Buttermark felt they should be additionally impressed into service as
                            escort-interpreters, while the others believed their function was
                            clearly that of “<gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss>’s.” After some
                            heated discussion, additional escort-interpreters were hired and the
                            show went on with the Americans being treated as all the others. There
                            was also tension among the three because both of the Program Directors’
                            pride in the uniqueness of the Symposium as opposed to the <gloss
                                target="#t_VPS_1">VPS</gloss> attitude that the exercise was “just
                            another <gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> program.” Certain oversights,
                            such as <gloss target="#t_VPS_1">VPS</gloss>’s insistence on taxis over
                            buses in New York because “it’s what we always do” resulted in wasted
                            time and short tempers, until corrected. But on the whole, once
                            committed, there was a genuine effort to make everything work. The fact
                            that almost everything did function is a tribute to the triumvirate’s
                            ultimate flexibility once the ship was in the water. However, someone to
                            play the Solomon role is definitely indicated in the future.</p>
                        <p>There was also significant positive reaction from U.S. groups concerned
                            with children’s <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> programming, such as
                                <gloss target="#t_WATCH_1">WATCH</gloss>, which hosted a reception.
                            And a letter from <gloss target="#t_PBS_1">PBS</gloss> revealed that
                            international children’s programming exchanges were “high on the list”
                            of projects <pb n="623" facs="0672" xml:id="pg_623"/>seeking funding.
                                <gloss target="#t_PBS_1">PBS</gloss> also urged the founding of an
                            international children’s <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>
                            clearinghouse.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the Symposium had one major fault: the lack of sufficient
                            follow-up, especially for the broadcasters. A great deal of energy, good
                            will, and positive experiences were generated, and generally abandoned
                            after the Symposium. Of course, there is the philosophical question of
                            just how much should be furnished to funding recipients and where they
                            should take up on their own. But in this case it does seem that we had a
                            marvelous opportunity which was not advantageously used. Also, an
                            international organization was in <persName corresp="#p_TC_1">Cecily
                                Truett</persName>’s original concept; it was also at least
                            abstracted later.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">ASSESSMENT OF AGENCY ACTION AND REACTION:</p>
                        <p>A number of “firsts” and departures from the norm were involved, as far
                            as <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> was concerned. The following
                            is a recap of these points, with results:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">It was the first time that <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                                    >USICA</gloss> had sponsored a national (or international)
                                rather than <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>-oriented
                                project</hi>. Additionally, it was the first Washington-originated
                            program. At <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>’s inception, the rule
                            had been established that no programs were to be imposed from
                            headquarters.</p>
                        <p>There were extremely mixed reactions all along. When the project was on
                            the drawing board and reaction was tested, three area offices were
                            mildly approving while two were violently opposed. Most of the
                            opposition appears to have been because “Books and Broadcasting” was not
                            connected with previously-approved Country Plans. Even when central
                            funding was obtained, several <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s
                            refused to consider it. Therefore, several important nations, such as
                            Japan and Mexico, were not represented. On the other hand, the “Walt
                            Disney of Brazil” was a participant.</p>
                        <p>The problems did not end with central funding; tensions among <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> elements over the various
                            “different” aspects of the project continued. This was especially
                            obvious in the <gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> office. However,
                            unlike the Symposium, there was one person with authority and,
                            furthermore, approval from the Director’s office.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">It was the first time that any attention had been
                                devoted to children’s programs.</hi> Some <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                                >USICA</gloss> area opposition can doubtless be traced to the fact
                            that children are not a target audience. However, in dealing as <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> did, with professionals active in
                            literature and broadcasting for children, it reached a sector—one of its
                            most important audiences, the world’s educators. And the evidence is
                            overwhelming that it reached them successfully and touched them
                            deeply.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">It was the first time that linkage was established
                                between the electronic and print media in such an event.</hi> As
                            reported above, there were obvious <pb n="624" facs="0673"
                                xml:id="pg_624"/>and continuing tensions here, but all participants
                            seem to have been at least receptive to the link. For some, it marked an
                            important change in attitude toward a traditional rival.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>’S USE OF OPPORTUNITIES
                            AFFORDED</p>
                        <p>As recorded at the beginning of this report, the project was undertaken
                            in large part to take advantage of the unique opportunities it
                            afforded:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">A good opportunity to work with the domestic
                                constituency.</hi> All evidence suggests that the domestic
                            constituency reached by the Project was impressed and enthusiastic.
                            Eventually, more than 35 groups and organizations participated, some
                            making quite significant contributions. For example, the Boston Public
                            Library postponed its Spring Book Fair until October to enable it to
                            highlight the presence of the Symposium. EXXON Corporation made a $5,000
                            grant. The Oregon Public Broadcasting Service made video playback
                            machines available, free of charge. The Children’s Book Council provided
                            discussion moderators during a two-day session in New York. Children’s
                            Television Workshop (creators and producers of SESAME STREET) hosted a
                            day at their facility, with the participation of top-level people.
                            National Public Radio sponsored a panel discussion, as did the Public
                            Broadcasting Service. <gloss target="#t_CBS_1">CBS</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_ABC_1">ABC</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_NBC_1"
                                >NBC</gloss> each hosted a group for screening sessions and lunch.
                            In all, 35 groups participated. However, concern remains that in some
                            areas the opportunity was not fully utilized because of a lack of
                            follow-up. Ms. <persName corresp="#p_TC_1">Truett</persName> was invited
                            to describe the project at the prestigious Aspen Institute, and later,
                            at the National Association of Educational Broadcasters convention. And
                            there have been other opportunities, though as mentioned before, no
                            systematic follow-up.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted again that the Symposium participants also influenced
                            individuals and groups around the United States wherever they went.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">It was good interagency politics</hi>. Follow-up
                            meetings of the Interagency Committee on the International Year of the
                            Child indicate that this opportunity was fully utilized. <hi
                                rend="italic">Books and Broadcasting for Children</hi> was hailed by
                            the Committee as the only really effective effort by a government
                            agency. At a meeting of the Committee February 27, 1980, the project’s
                            particular significance was discussed. It was saluted as “one of the
                            most outstanding examples of a project that happened only because of
                                <gloss target="#t_IYC_1">IYC</gloss>; broke new ground by
                            challenging agency policy on children; and shows evidence of having
                            lasting effects on the international development and exchange of quality
                            children’s media productions.”</p>
                        <p>3. The project, which melded media and education, was clearly suited to
                                <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>. No argument on this
                            point.</p>
                        <pb n="625" facs="0674" xml:id="pg_625"/>
                        <p>4. It would be a good test of the joint-funding concept. The test results
                            are largely successful. There was, as previously noted, grant assistance
                            from <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>. And other government entities
                            participated, while not writing checks. The Agency for International
                            Development provided facilities for a panel concerned with literacy
                            programs. The Federal Communications Commission participated in a
                            similar manner, and the Library of Congress hosted a tour and luncheon
                            at which Librarian <persName corresp="#p_BDJ_1">Daniel
                                Boorstin</persName> was speaker.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">RIPPLE EFFECTS:</p>
                        <p>Turkish book illustrator Ms. Can Goknil was highly successful in reaching
                            high-level Turkish audiences to relate her experiences with the
                            Symposium, in a January 23, 1980 discussion on children’s publications
                            at the <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> Istanbul library. As a
                            result Ms. Goknil was approached by every publishing house
                            representative in the audience for additional information on U.S.
                            publishing companies and upcoming international children’s book fairs.
                            Ms. Goknil was also asked to be guest speaker at the Istanbul Fair later
                            in 1980.</p>
                        <p>Ms. Loty Petrovits-Androutsopoulou made a presentation through <gloss

                            as “successful.” It included the 30-minute videotape produced by Ms.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TC_1">Truett</persName>. Ms.

                            contribution of Brer-Snake, who fascinated my audience!”</p>
                        <p>Dr. Ingeborg Ramseger of West Germany documented her experiences in two

                        <p>There was spotty, but generally adequate press coverage in the U.S. as
                            well. There were three <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> interviews in

                            Oregon. Articles on the Symposium appeared in <hi rend="italic">The

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">OVERALL ASSESSMENT:</p>
                        <p>“BOOKS AND BROADCASTING FOR CHILDREN: An International Symposium” was in
                            almost all respects extremely effective and successful. Its two major
                            drawbacks were the lack of complete focus during the Symposium (though
                            not during the planning), mainly due to the dual nature of the project
                            and the lack of one person with final authority; and the failure for
                            whatever reason to follow-up with some proposal for an international
                            clearinghouse, especially for educational broadcasters.</p>
                        <p>There is every reason to be optimistic that another project, similarly
                            conceived and executed, could be even more successful with the basis of
                            experience gained on this project.</p>

                    <p>As of 9:00 a.m. this morning the Soviets began jamming <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> (in Russian, Ukrainian and Armenian) as
                        well as <gloss target="#t_BBC_1">BBC</gloss> and Deutsche Welle. This is the
                        first time that the Soviets have jammed <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        since they ceased jamming it in August 1973. (Radio Liberty of course has
                        continued to be jammed). As far as can be ascertained at the moment, RFE
                        broadcasts to Eastern Europe not previously jammed—i.e., Poland, Rumania and
                        Hungary—have experienced no increased interference or jamming. (C)</p>
                    <p>The last time that the Soviets resumed jamming of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> was in August 1968 just after the invasion of
                        Czechoslovakia. (Prior to that, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> had not
                        been jammed since 1963.) The Soviet action most likely reflects the Soviets’
                        fear of the impact on their own population of news about the unrest in
                        Poland. The fact that Deutsche Welle is also being jammed reinforces the
                        view that the Soviet action is primarily related to Poland (rather than
                        Afghanistan or some other event). Moreover, given the Ukraine’s close
                        historical ties and geographic proximity to Poland—as well as its strong
                        indigenous nationalism—it is no accident that the Soviets have begun jamming
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s Ukrainian service as well.
                        (C)</p>
                    <p>The Soviet action is an important development. It is a clear violation of the
                        Helsinki Accords<note n="2" xml:id="d210fn2">Basket Three of the Helsinki
                            Final Act holds all participating states to “encourage the wider showing
                            and broadcasting of a greater variety of recorded and filmed information
                            from the other participating States, illustrating the various aspects of
                            life in their countries,” and to “note the expansion in the
                            dissemination of information broadcast by radio, and express the hope
                            for the continuation of this process, so as to meet the interest of
                            mutual understanding among peoples and the aims set forth by this
                            Conference.”</note> and attests to their intense concern about the
                        impact of news about the Polish unrest on their own population. The Soviets
                        would not undertake such a move lightly, since it will affect <pb n="627"
                            facs="0676" xml:id="pg_627"/>their relations not only with us but with
                        other West Europeans, particularly the West Germans. Moreover, it is likely
                        that the jamming will endure well beyond the duration of the unrest in
                        Poland. (C)</p>

                        that are particularly hard to explain to the American people: Third World
                        demands, unanticipated political change, the relative strength of the U.S.
                        in the world, and the independent views of our allies.</p>
                    <p>A number of the memos suggest that more can be done to make foreign policy
                        seem relevant to everyday concerns. We can stress the economic stakes we
                        have in foreign relations (jobs, resources and the prices paid for imports
                        are three immediate suggestions). We can relate development efforts abroad
                        to pressures to emigrate to the U.S. (<gloss target="#t_OES_1">OES</gloss>),
                        or to narcotics flows (<gloss target="#t_INR_1">INR</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_OES_1">OES</gloss>). A number suggest that we can do more to

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Resources</p>
                    <p>The growing reluctance of Americans to dedicate sufficient resources to
                        foreign affairs, particularly to economic and military assistance, is a
                        commonly recognized problem. It is also agreed that we should actively seek
                        to build support for aid, stressing that it is crucial to our effectiveness
                        in changed international economic and political circumstances. In addition
                        to the competitive (with the Soviets) and humanitarian rationales, we can
                        show that aid helps create stable growing economies which are increasingly
                        important to us as markets for our exports (H, <gloss target="#t_IDCA_1"

                        U.S. influence in the world, yet desires reduced aid levels. We can
                        highlight the cost of aid cuts in terms of influence (<gloss

                        broadcasts.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union is utilizing two types of interference to jam foreign
                        broadcasts. One method, called “mayak jamming,” transmits a distorted
                        version of a regular Soviet domestic program on the same frequency as a
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> program. The other method, “noise
                        jamming,” is a buzz sound transmitted on the same frequency as the <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcast. The jamming noise reaches its
                        targets either by radiation from powerful transmitters beaming signals into
                        the ionosphere and reflecting them back to earth or by groundwave
                        propagation. Skywave jamming can cover large areas, and groundwave jamming
                        can effectively interfere with reception in large cities.</p>
                    <p>Jamming normally is a very expensive undertaking, more expensive than
                        broadcasting itself. The speed and exactitude with which the Soviets have
                        interfered this time with <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts,
                        however, lead us to suspect that they are employing their mobile military
                        transmitters <pb n="632" facs="0681" xml:id="pg_632"/>for jamming, in
                        addition to those transmitters they used for jamming previously. The
                        military transmitters exist as back-up facilities to satellite circuits;
                        thus their use for jamming would require neither new construction
                        expenditures nor the disruption, under peacetime circumstances, of other
                        uses of the military transmitters.</p>
                    <p>It is unlikely that we would ever succeed completely in overtaxing the
                        capabilities of Soviet jamming equipment. It is also unlikely that they
                        would ever succeed in thoroughly blotting out reception of <gloss

                    <p>A combination of several techniques has enabled <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> to penetrate Soviet jamming to some extent: 1) high power
                        transmitters are delivering the strongest possible signal into the Soviet
                        Union; 2) as many transmitters as possible can beam many different
                        frequencies to achieve what is called “saturation broadcasting”; and 3)
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is transmitting the same program
                        simultaneously from <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Relay Stations
                        located at different geographical points to take advantage of varying
                        propagation conditions. We have added three transmissions in Russian from
                        our station in Kavala, Greece, and one transmission in Georgian, Armenian
                        and Ukrainian from our station in Tangiers. In addition, due to the fact
                        that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is transmitting from West to East,
                        there is a short period each day when <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        can use frequencies higher than the jammers; we refer to this period as
                        “twilight immunity.”</p>
                    <p>We have begun a series of meetings at <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> to
                        examine a range of technical and political options that might be employed if
                        protracted jamming continues. These will include the possible reassignment
                        and increase of frequencies available to beam the programs, the extension of
                        broadcast time, and the recasting of programs. The latter option would cater
                        to short-span listening by reducing music programs to a minimum and by
                        replacing block programs with a magazine format and an increased number of
                        newscasts. We will also consider broadcasting in Russian and other Soviet
                        languages for longer periods and during different hours.</p>

                        international agreements. In 1950, the U.N. General Assembly adopted
                        Resolution 424 (v), which condemned jamming “as a denial of the right of all
                        persons to be fully informed concerning news, opinions, and ideas regardless
                        of frontiers.” Further, the U.S. Government shares with most other countries
                        the position that intentional interference with radio transmissions is a
                        violation of the International Telecommunications Convention.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the World Administrative Radio Conference of 1979, the
                        United States asserted that since some of its broadcasting was subject to
                        interference, it would take the necessary and appropriate actions to protect
                        its broadcasting interests. Neither the Soviet Union nor any other nation
                        entered a contrary statement.</p>
                    <p>Over the last month, the Soviets have consistently denied that they are
                        jamming our broadcasts, although they have claimed that they would be within
                        their rights to do so. In the past, the Soviets have used a variety of
                        public forums to attempt to justify jamming, citing their sovereignty over
                        the “ether” in their country and their “right and duty” to protect their
                        people from what they consider to be subversive broadcasts and “radio
                        aggressions.”</p>

                            BRAY</persName> III DEPUTY DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION AGENCY
                        BEFORE THEMID-AMERICA AND THE WORLD CONFERENCEKANSAS CITY, MISSOURI</p>
                    <p>For thirty years and more, the U.S. Government has conducted overseas
                        information and exchange programs. The best known of these are the Voice of
                        America and the <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName>
                        scholarship program. In the spring of 1978, these programs were brought
                        together under the new International Communication Agency. On the surface,
                        the reorganization simply brought together a little known bureaucracy—<gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>—and a single entity of the Department of
                        State—the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs—to perform functions
                        familiar only to small numbers of the American public.</p>
                    <p>But the creation of the new agency was something more than a redrawing of the
                        organizational charts of the federal bureaucracy. Indeed, the creation of
                        the International Communication Agency marked a turning point in the manner
                        in which we conduct our relations with other countries. <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> is the first agency of the Executive
                        Branch established to deal centrally with what may increasingly be the two
                        most important elements in our relations with other nations—people and
                        ideas.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> gave the Agency
                        three principal tasks:</p>
                    <p>—the explanation and advocacy of this country’s foreign and domestic
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>—the explanation of American society and culture and the encouragement of
                        dialogue between the people of the United States and those of other
                            societies.<note n="2" xml:id="d213fn2">See <ref target="#d121">Document
                                121</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>We carry out these tasks in a variety of ways: personal contact between our
                        officers overseas and opinion leaders in the countries to which they are
                        assigned; sending abroad American speakers on a variety of topics; bringing
                        to the United States each year some 2,000 foreign <pb n="635" facs="0684"
                            xml:id="pg_635"/>leaders to visit with their American counterparts in
                        government, labor, mass media, science, education and other fields; managing
                        the <persName corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName> program; sending
                        American artists and their work overseas; running libraries of American
                        books; producing films and videotapes; broadcasting in 38 languages and many
                        other programs.</p>
                    <p>But we also have a third responsibility: to assist Americans in their
                        understanding of other countries. It is that responsibility which has
                        brought us to Kansas City today.</p>
                    <p>There is ample evidence that the United States today faces a “knowledge gap,”
                        just as we faced a “missile gap” in the 1960s. I refer not to our knowledge
                        of technology or science or economics. The recent Nobel Prizes awarded to
                        Americans indicate that we are doing well in those and other areas. Rather,
                        I am talking about our knowledge of the now shrunken world and our
                        competence to deal with it.</p>
                    <p>The problem is a serious one. It is nation-wide. And it is probably least
                        recognized in Mid-America. The reasons are not hard to find. If Americans in
                        other regions have believed that the Atlantic and Pacific were wide and deep
                        enough to preserve them from the outside world, mid-Americans had the added
                        buffers of over a thousand miles of continent. The hardships of settling
                        these plains and making them fruitful rightly convinced the early settlers
                        and those who followed that “going it alone” was not only possible, but was
                        the only way. Indeed, “going it alone” has long been part of America’s
                        self-image.</p>
                    <p>In recent years, however, the world “out there” has intruded into our
                        national life with dizzying regularity. Mid-America is very much a part of
                        this world. Grain sales to the Soviet Union and the oil embargo of the early
                        1970s had great impact here—one pleasant, one less so.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d213fn3">Presumable references to the July 1972 Soviet purchase

                        Zone is the largest of its type in the nation. Almost 40,000 Missourians
                        earn their livelihood from exports. One dollar in every five of Missouri’s
                        farm sales comes from exports. Missouri ranks only 29th in population among
                        the states, but 12th in agricultural exports and 15th in exports of
                        manufactures.</p>
                    <p>Nationally, one out of every eight manufacturing jobs depends on exports. One
                        out of every three dollars of U.S. corporate profits is derived from
                        International activities. We import nearly half of our petroleum. Nearly two
                        thirds of our imports are essential raw materials. Significantly the fastest
                        growing export markets are in the developing world, about which we know
                        least as a people.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, there is a paradox. At a time when neither we nor any other nation in
                        the world can go it alone even if we wished, understanding <pb n="636"
                            facs="0685" xml:id="pg_636"/>of this fact and our preparation to live in
                        such a world are signally inadequate.</p>
                    <p>I think it only prudent to assume that, for the first time in our national
                        existence, the issue before us is that of survival.</p>
                    <p>The question of survival has not been part of our discourse since the War of
                        1812. America emerged from World War II virtually unchallenged. We believed
                        that we could solve most of our national problems by overwhelming them with
                        our resources and wealth. We did not have to confront the unpleasant fact
                        that a civilization’s existence can never be assured. We believed we were
                        exempt from history, that God’s good grace would protect us. Perhaps some
                        sensed that our national good fortune could not last forever, but even they
                        thought that real change would take generations.</p>
                    <p>It should now be apparent to us all that it has not.</p>
                    <p>We need to confront the reality that those who survive are those who are
                        prepared, those who are willing to invest and to sacrifice for survival.</p>
                    <p>In public discussions of recent years it became fashionable to describe the
                        world as “interdependent.” Certainly the world has changed since 1945.
                        Certainly our <hi rend="italic">great</hi> national problems cannot be
                        addressed in other than international terms. But this is <hi rend="italic"
                            >not</hi> the real news. The real shift is that for the first time in
                        our national existence, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> have become dependent on
                        others. The fact shocks us. We have not yet adjusted to it. And we have much
                        adjusting to do.</p>
                    <p>We are dealing with a puzzle of extraordinary magnitude: for all of America’s
                        long years as a world power, for all its engagements in virtually every part
                        of the globe, we now witness an entirely new stage in world development; and
                        yet too many Americans hardly see it at all. We fail dismally to unhook
                        ourselves from outworn perspectives which have lost their relevance to the
                        new motor forces of world events. We cling to easy dichotomies—East-West;
                        Capitalist-Communist; the haves and have-nots. We fail to see a world awash
                        in new political sub-units brought into being by nationalist or religious
                        fervor, and thrusts toward cultural and ethnic self-determination. In such a
                        world the old ideologies are incorrect, risk being at least misleading.
                        Holding onto them may well have serious consequences.</p>
                    <p>Old habits of mind die slowly in nations, as they do in individuals. And
                        those old ways of thinking about the world function like blinders. They
                        prevent us from recognizing all of the potentially unpleasant aspects of a
                        smaller, interdependent world. Unpleasant because genuine interdependence
                        suggests a situation for which there is no real precedent in our national
                        experience—that we are now, like most other societies throughout history, at
                        the mercy of important events and decisions beyond our collective grasp.</p>
                    <pb n="637" facs="0686" xml:id="pg_637"/>
                    <p>We live in a world which is increasingly not of our choosing nor of our
                        imagination. This is at variance with what our experience and our education
                        have taught us: that the forces of history were on our side, that we were
                        capable of shaping our own destiny.</p>
                    <p>What if our circumstances have changed and this should no longer be true?</p>
                    <p>We are strong as a nation, but far from omnipotent. One of the lessons of our
                        experiences in Indochina, and now in Iran and Afghanistan, concerns the
                        limits of traditional power. We know now that we can no longer live by the
                        application of an overwhelming dominance in political, military or economic
                        power. We face the far more difficult task of living by our wits, by our
                        knowledge of others and by our skill in dealing with them.</p>
                    <p>By temperament and training, Americans are not well equipped to deal with
                        their new situation. We are thrown into contact and conflict with peoples
                        whose histories and motivations we scarcely understand. Can we comprehend
                        the new forms of political change, quite distinct from Western models, that
                        are evolving before our eyes? How many educated Americans—aside from a few
                        scholars—appreciate in even the vaguest way, the dynamism and values of
                        Islamic cultures? How many of us understand the nature of the conflicts now
                        plaguing the Central American countries?</p>
                    <p>On another level, few of us speak anyone else’s language. The report last
                        year of the President’s Commission on Foreign Language and International
                            Studies<note n="4" xml:id="d213fn4">See <ref target="#d168fn2">footnote
                                2, Document 168</ref>.</note> indicates that only 8 percent of our
                        colleges and universities have a foreign language entrance requirement, as
                        against 34 percent in 1966 and an astounding 85 percent in 1915. I would be
                        the last to argue that language <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> is a path to
                        automatic understanding of other societies, but its virtual absence in our
                        curricula is symptomatic of our approach to the world.</p>
                    <p>Other evidence is equally discouraging. Consider:</p>
                    <p>—During 1968–77, a period when some 2 million jobs became dependent on
                        exports, enrollments in college and university foreign language courses
                        dropped 21 percent.</p>
                    <p>—Only one in twenty undergraduates enrolls in courses dealing with foreign
                        peoples and cultures.</p>
                    <p>—A bare 5 percent of all the nation’s teachers have had any exposure to
                        international studies and training.</p>
                    <p>—Fewer than 2 percent of high school graduates have any foreign language
                        competence.</p>

                    <p>—A <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> study of 30,000 ten- and
                        fourteen-year-olds in nine nations ranked Americans next to last in their
                        comprehension of foreign cultures.</p>
                    <p>Unhappily, government and private funding support for international studies
                        has declined dramatically in recent years. In real terms, the $41.2 million
                        dollars provided by the United States and other countries for the <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJM_2">Fulbright</persName> exchange program last year
                        amounted to only 60 percent of the level in 1965. National Defense Education
                        Act Title VI Fellowships for foreign area study are at an all time low. The
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> Foundation, which invested
                        $242 million in international programs in the 1960s, projected less than $4
                        million for that purpose in 1978.</p>
                    <p>Our “gross national inadequacy in foreign languages,” as <persName
                            corresp="#p_PJA_1">James Perkins</persName> has written, has a direct
                        effect on our foreign affairs. In our embassy in the Soviet Union, only one
                        of our top foreign service officers is required to speak Ukrainian; none
                        speak Uzbek or any of the other Turkic languages of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s increasingly restive Moslem peoples. A
                        total of 12 officers in our foreign service have Chinese at a truly useful
                        level, while only 19 are fully fluent in Japanese. On the legislative side,
                        there is no full-time Soviet and East European specialist on a Congressional
                        committee staff.</p>
                    <p>This litany of disturbing facts and shortcomings is not a counsel of despair.
                        But it should be a basis for action.</p>
                    <p>What then is to be done? How can positive change be brought about? That is
                        for you to decide. Communities and groups around the country are beginning
                        to confront the “knowledge gap” and are hard at work.</p>
                    <p>Seattle, Washington, is making notable efforts to transform the report of the
                        President’s Commission into reality. An energetic coalition of state and
                        local authorities, educators, academics, business and non-profit people, not
                        to say concerned citizens has succeeded in placing the future of languages
                        and international studies high on the public agenda.</p>
                    <p>The San Francisco Bay area is forming a similar coalition to make the study
                        of languages and other societies an integral part of curricula there.</p>
                    <p>This fall, Staten Island’s Curtis High School has begun offering a program of
                        language and international business specifically tailored to the skills that
                        employers seek in the New York City area. A public elementary school in

                        dimensions of a city’s international engagement. A study of international
                        business education by the American Council of Collegiate Schools of Business
                        led General Electric and the Exxon Education Foundation to subsidize a
                        series of workshops to sensitize business school faculties to the
                        international dimension of business education.</p>
                    <p>These and other examples have something in common: in each instance, it was a
                        cadre of concerned and interested citizens who made the difference and who
                        are bringing about change.</p>
                    <p>The Federal government can help by acknowledging the problem, placing it on
                        the national agenda, and providing modest financial support. My own agency’s
                        role in this might best be described as that of a “friendly broker,” alert
                        to matching up individuals, institutions, programs and resources abroad with
                        their counterparts in this country. But the Federal government can only do
                        so much.</p>
                    <p>The important decisions must be made at state and local levels. This is
                        fundamentally a civic problem; it will respond to citizen interests. But
                        there will be no meaningful, continuous support for enhancing international
                        awareness until citizens perceive international affairs as a local
                        responsibility—something that affects each one of them. Changes in the way
                        we teach and learn about the world will not happen because of massive
                        transfusions of moneys, but by massive transfusions of fresh perspective and
                        intellectual vigor.</p>
                    <p>I don’t pretend to be an expert on Kansas City or mid-America. I don’t know
                        which business leaders are most supportive of international education, or
                        which are most involved in international business here. I don’t know the
                        examples of effective business participation in linking domestic development
                        to international markets and foreign trade. I don’t know the business
                        leaders who participate in world affairs citizen education groups, and which
                        ones sit on the boards of trustees of your colleges and universities.</p>
                    <p>I would suggest, however, that you find out who they are and give them full
                        credit and reception for what they are doing. “Turning it around” requires a
                        great deal of mutual reinforcement.</p>
                    <p>There is much to be done. We are at a pivotal point in our history. We are
                        late in realizing it. We must begin, now, to think and talk about a world
                        where hard choices must be made, where basic human values must be better
                        understood and more carefully responded to, where our decisions must be
                        shaped by a consistent, knowledgeable commitment to the future.</p>
                    <p>Building appropriate education systems is a long-range task. Just as
                        imperative is the need to find and support palliative measures in the
                        short-term.</p>
                    <pb n="640" facs="0689" xml:id="pg_640"/>
                    <p>For me the palliative, and here I quote Robert Chollar of the Kettering
                        Foundation, is “to preserve the involvement and expand the understanding of
                        the minority who are attentive to international relations.”</p>
                    <p>Our future would be well-rewarded if, acting together, you here and we in the
                        Federal government, and others who share our concerns, could find ways to
                        support and encourage those in this country who are intellectually engaged
                        with international issues. The importance of providing them with adequate,
                        continuing support in the national interest cannot be overstated.</p>
                    <p>I am talking about a group which can be numbered in the hundreds of thousands
                        rather than in the millions: people such as you who are part of a community
                        of interest in the larger world.</p>
                    <p>It is to you, I believe, that we must look for that minimum group of informed
                        and critical intellects—and resulting social discourse—to see us through the
                        next generation.</p>
                    <p>However real the impediments to an effective response, and they exist, we
                        cannot afford to turn away from involvement.</p>
                    <p>Education that teaches us to celebrate rather than condemn cultural
                        diversity, to understand rather than undermine differing traditions and
                        beliefs, to respect rather than revile mankind’s infinite variations—such
                        education may not be enough to preserve our precarious perch on the
                        favorable side of history, but surely the effort must be made. I am reminded
                        of what a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> official said some time ago. He
                        noted that a child born today into a world of four billion plus people will,
                        if she or he attains age 60, be sharing the earth with three times as many
                        human beings: “A child born today,” he said, “will be both actor and
                        beneficiary, or victim, in a total world fabric, and he may rightly ask: Why
                        was I not warned? Why was I not better educated? Why did my teachers not
                        tell me about these problems?”.</p>
                    <p>Why, indeed? What greater default than this: that we should fail to warn our
                        children?</p>

                    <p>Surveys of foreign public opinion have found widespread evidence of
                        perceptions of declining U.S. power—overall power as well as the elements of
                        nuclear, military, and economic strength.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Perceptions of Declining U.S. Overall Power</p>
                    <p>U.S. ratings as <hi rend="italic">most powerful</hi> have suffered major
                        declines in seven countries for which trends are available. In consequence,
                        while the U.S. still retains some lead in France, Israel and Mexico City, it
                        has slipped behind the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in Britain,
                        West Germany and Australia, and dropped to about even in Japan. The failed
                        U.S. effort to rescue the hostages in Iran, which occurred later, might have
                        accentuated the downward trends.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Perceptions of Declining Elements of U.S. Power</p>
                    <p>Foreign views of declining U.S. overall power are paralleled by similar
                        losses in major components of the power image.</p>
                    <p>• Surveys in 1979 found pluralities in Germany, France, and Italy viewing the
                        U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as “about equal” in <hi
                            rend="italic">nuclear power</hi>—the British predominantly see the
                        Soviet ahead. But in all four countries, there has been a decline in ratings
                        of U.S. nuclear strength compared with 1972 and 1977.</p>
                    <p>• When last measured in 1977, surveys found marked losses (since 1969) in
                        U.S. <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>

                            >USSR</gloss> more often than the U.S. viewed as ahead, in Britain,
                        France and West Germany. Only in Italy did the U.S. retain a slight
                        edge.</p>
                    <p>• U.S. economic power is also seen as declining in 1979 and 1980 surveys in
                        Western Europe and Japan, with West Germany emerging as a major competitor.
                        While ratings of the U.S. as strongest economically prevail among the
                        Japanese, U.S. standing is far behind West Germany among the British, about
                        equal among the French and the West Germans, and has only a slight edge
                        among the Italians.</p>

                        by lessened respect and lessened confidence in U.S. wisdom in world

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s Reorganization
                        Plan No. 2 of 1977 consolidated the functions of the former U.S. Information
                        Agency with the State Department’s former Bureau of Educational and Cultural
                        Affairs into the new International Communication Agency (<gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss>), established on April 1, 1978.<note

                        The outcome of the reorganization has been greater managerial efficiency as
                        well as a more coherent approach to the sharing of ideas between Americans
                        and foreign peoples. With maximum credibility and impact as a primary aim,
                        and in fulfillment of the mandate of the President and the Congress, <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> has stressed dialogue over soliloquy in
                        the practice of communication with foreign peoples.</p>
                    <p>Efforts have also been made to staunch the serious decline in funding
                        suffered by the exchange-of-persons programs prior to the reorganization,
                        and to respond to new opportunities to serve the national interest in China,
                        the Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East and South Asia. Because the
                        Agency’s financial resources have remained essentially static and its
                        personnel levels have declined further over the last four years,
                        communication initiatives have been achieved through the reprogramming of
                        existing funding levels.</p>

                        in which it should broadcast during the coming decade, updating previous

                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has added or expanded programs in Farsi,
                        Dari, Bengali, Urdu, Hausa, Turkish and English to the Near East and South
                        Asia, and is in the process of adding broadcasts in Azeri and increasing
                        Uzbek programs. In the Caribbean, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has
                        doubled its English programming to four hours per day, and is seeking a
                        medium-wave outlet for carrying that programming. During the last four
                        years, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has added 13½ hours a week and 3
                        new languages (Farsi, Dari and Hausa) to its programming schedule, bringing
                        its total output up to 686 hours a week in 39 languages. In <gloss

                        U.S. access to Islamic audiences over a wide area.</p>
                    <p>One of the most significant developments in recent years has been the
                        dramatic increase in <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s listenership in
                        the People’s Republic of China. Since the cessation of jamming in 1977,
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s Chinese audiences have grown
                        rapidly and are now estimated to number over 100 million listeners.</p>
                    <p>With the reorganization of the Agency, the Voice of America was made fully
                        responsible for its own output in all its broadcast languages, and its
                        policy advocacy function was clearly separated from its news and other
                        programming operations. As part of the new operating rela<pb n="644"

                        correspondents, placing them for the first time on an equal basis
                        journalistically with their colleagues in the commercial news media, and
                        thus enhancing their credibility and operational mobility.</p>
                    <p rend="center">EXCHANGE PROGRAMS</p>
                    <p>With the implementation of Reorganization Plan No. 2, which transferred
                        administration of the U.S. Government’s exchange programs from the
                        Department of State to the International Communication Agency, the greatest
                        challenge facing administrators of the exchange programs was to assuage the
                        fears of those inside and outside the organization who doubted the continued
                        efficiency and “integrity” of their conduct in an Agency that had formerly
                        been primarily concerned with informing and persuading foreign audiences.
                        Simply put, this challenge has been successfully met. Not only have the
                        exchange programs been maintained and their links to outside constituencies
                        strengthened; at the same time, they have become essential elements in the
                        Agency’s contribution to the conduct of American foreign relations. During
                        this period:</p>

                        cultures. To carry out that directive, the Agency created a new program of
                        competitively awarded grants to U.S. private organizations involved in
                        “American learning.”</p>

                        The quality of the participants and of the programs arranged for them by
                        American universities testify to the trust and involvement of academic
                        institutions here and abroad and add a program for non-academic

                            >USICA</gloss>, the Agency made significant progress in coordinating
                        U.S. Government exchange programs and policy. The first reports on

                        draws its programs, the Agency, on the Endowment panels’ recommendation,
                        worked with a consortium of U.S. businesses to program “Art Inc: American

                        professors are invited to lecture abroad. Recently, William Saroyan, John

                        provided ideas and <pb n="646" facs="0695" xml:id="pg_646"/>information
                        about the American experience in federal government to the men shaping the
                        new Nigerian constitution and its current development. Our post arranged a
                        long series of lectures and seminars on our governmental system, provided
                        copies of philosophical U.S. political treatises, and sent important

                    <p>All <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">USICA</gloss> efforts in South Africa are
                        focused on encouraging a rapid end to apartheid and peaceful transition
                        toward majority rule. We have brought more than 75 carefully-selected
                        influential white South Africans to the U.S. to expose them to the American
                        civil rights experience and to stimulate their thinking on how they might
                        move toward an inter-racial society of their own. More than 100 South

                        various aspects of peaceful change; we supported programs of South African
                        institutions aimed at peaceful change; and we have used our “neutrality” to
                        allow our premises to serve as one of the very few venues in the entire
                        country where members of all races can meet as equals for substantive
                        discussion.</p>
                    <p>When “human rights” was first articulated as a major American foreign policy
                        plank, it was greeted with skepticism and sometimes outright scorn in
                        Africa. Today, four years later, it has become part of the political agenda

                        possible forms of cultural and educational programming. In 1980, scholars
