                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of the General Editor, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of historical scholarship. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 established a new statutory charter for the preparation of the series, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of Stateʼs Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.). The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should include all records from all relevant departments and agencies needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume, which was collected and edited from 1995 to 1997, meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</hi>
                </p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of the 5 years (1964–1968) of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>. <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>The subseries presents in 34 volumes the documentary record of major foreign policy decisions and actions of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>ʼs administration. The editors of the volume sought to include documentation illuminating the foreign policymaking process of the U.S. Government, with emphasis on the highest level at which policy on a particular subject was determined. The documents include memoranda and records of discussions that set forth policy issues and show decisions or actions taken. The emphasis is on the development of U.S. policy and on major aspects and repercussions of its execution rather than on the implementation of policy.</p>

                <p>This volume documents U.S. policy toward the Dominican Republic including a period of great crisis that culminated in the decision to send U.S. military forces to that country. The United States then oversaw a reconstitution of the Dominican Government and a Dominican presidential election in 1967. Also covered is U.S. policy toward Cuba, essentially an account of U.S. attempts to isolate <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs Cuba both diplomatically and economically through sanctions, and the internal Washington debate over the extent and nature of U.S. covert policy toward the island nation. The remainder of the volume does not cover a broad swath of countries, but concentrates on the two most difficult relationships in the area for the United States: Haiti and the British Colony of British Guiana (after 1966, independent Guyana). In Haiti the problem was essentially the mismanagement of the country and repression of the people by dictator Francois “Papa Doc” Duvalier. The main questions for policymakers in Washington were how much business, if any, should the United States do with Duvalier, how they could help the Haitian people without helping the regime, and how much contact and support it should give his opponents, all of whom were in exile. Although part of South America, the English speaking country British Guiana/Guyana has been included in this volume based on the similarities of the issues that the United States faced there. In Guyana, the United States sought to prevent leftist <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName> from becoming Prime Minister and instead successfully supported <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Linden Burnham</persName>, his principal opponent.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> made the major foreign policy decisions during his presidency, and the editors sought to document his role as far as possible. In the case of the intervention in the Dominican Republic, <persName>Johnson</persName> relied heavily upon the recommendations of his key advisers and special envoys, and their role and advice to the President is documented. It will become obvious that during the Dominican crisis—especially through the transcripts of Presidential tapes—<persName>Johnson</persName> was a hands-on President who after assessing advice, made the major <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>policy decisions. The role of the President and his major foreign policy advisers, including his hard-to-document Secretary of State, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>, are less pronounced in the other chapters in the volume dealing with Cuba, Haiti, and British Guiana/Guyana. This volume follows the pattern of other volumes in the 1964–1968 subseries: focusing on policy formulation in Washington. In the case of the Dominican Republic there is a close connection between events in Santo Domingo and policy in Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time. Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in the limitations of modern typography. The editors have supplied a heading for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume, however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the documentʼs source, original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been made to determine <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>if a document has been previously published, and, if so, this information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources, provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes, describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page numbers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The Historical Advisory Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of the series. Although the Historical Advisory Committee does not attempt to review the contents of individual volumes in the series, it does monitor the overall process and makes recommendations on particular problems that come to its attention.</p>
                <p>The Historical Advisory Committee reviewed the sections of this volume on the Dominican Republic and Guyana and advised on declassification issues.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft">
                    <hi rend="italic">Declassification Review</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification review of the documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958 on Classified National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information, subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The declassification review of this volume, which began in 1997 and was completed in 2005, resulted in the decision to withhold 6 documents in full, excise a paragraph <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>or more in 27 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a paragraph in 66 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here provide an accurate account of U.S. policy toward the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Haiti, and British Guiana/Guyana.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The editors wish to acknowledge the assistance of officials at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> Library of the National Archives and Records Administration, especially Regina Greenwell and Charlaine Burgess, who provided key research assistance and access to the <persName>Johnson</persName> Presidential tape recordings. The staff of the <persName>Johnson</persName> Library also worked with the staff of the Office of the Historian to obtain access to the telephone conversations of <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Thomas Mann</persName>. The editors also wish to acknowledge the assistance of historians at the Central Intelligence Agency, especially Gerald Haines and Scott Koch, who facilitated access to the records of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
                <p>Carolyn Yee, Daniel Lawler, and Edward C. Keefer collected documentation. Carolyn Yee selected, annotated, and edited the chapter on the Dominican Republic and Daniel Lawler produced the chapters on Cuba, Haiti, and Guyana. They worked under the supervision of Edward C. Keefer, then Chief of the Asia and Americas Division, and now General Editor. Vicki E. Futscher, Rita M. Baker, Florence Segura, and Kristin L. Ahlberg did the copy and technical editing and Susan C. Weetman coordinated the declassification review. Do Mi Stauber prepared the index.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the Departmentʼs Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Departmentʼs indexed central files for these years have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (Archives II) at College Park, Maryland. Most of the Departmentʼs decentralized office (or lot) files covering this period, which the National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred from the Departmentʼs custody to Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full access to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other Federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have full access to records of the Department of Defense, particularly the records of the Secretaries of Defense and their major assistants, and full access to the records of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>

                </p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors made extensive use of some of the most authoritative sources on President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>ʼs policies on the <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0014"/>Dominican Republic, Cuba, Haiti, and British Guiana/Guyana: the Presidential papers and other White House records at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> Library. Within the National Security File (NSF), the Country Files for the four countries covered were the most important. Next in importance in the NSF, and reflecting the strong intelligence emphasis of this volume, was the Intelligence File. Other important files in the NSF were the Aides Files, Files of <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Gordon Chase</persName>, which were valuable for the Dominican Republic and Cuba. Also of use from the NSF were Memos to the President (from <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>), the National Intelligence Estimates File, National Security Council Meetings, Special Head of State Correspondence, and the Agency Files, SIG (Senior Review Group). The SIG oversaw policy towards Cuba in the later part of the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration.</p>
                <p>Of the collections outside the NSF at the <persName>Johnson</persName> Library, by far the most significant were the audiotapes of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>ʼs telephone conversations, to which the editors had full access for 1964–1968 thanks to the cooperation of the staff of the <persName>Johnson</persName> Library. <persName>Johnson</persName> frequently discussed the details of his foreign policy towards the Dominican Republic and Cuba with his key advisers and senior members of Congress. As such, the tape recordings provide an unparalleled perspective on decision-making often missing in more formal documentation. The editors transcribed numerous tape recordings specifically for this volume; these transcripts are printed both as documents and in the annotation as extracts. The <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Thomas C. Mann</persName> Papers, especially the transcripts of his telephone conversations with <persName>Johnson</persName>, were also valuable in revealing the thinking behind the Presidentʼs policies.</p>
                <p>The records of the Department of State were also indispensable in documenting foreign policy formulation. Although the President made the important decisions, the Department of State was primarily responsible for the development, coordination, and implementation of the administrationʼs policy in the region. The editors of this volume relied heavily upon the Departmentʼs “subject-numeric” central files, which contain the essential telegrams, memoranda, correspondence, and other records of U.S. diplomacy. The most valuable subject numeric central file for the Dominican Republic was 23–9 DOM REP, used for rebellion and coups, but, in effect, often a virtual catchall for Department of State documents on the Dominican Republic. Other files of special note for the Dominican Republic were POL 1 DOM REP, POL 2 DOM REP and POL 15 DOM REP. For Cuba the subject-numeric central files were not as significant, in part because there was no Embassy in Cuba and therefore no telegraphic exchanges. The best central file documentation is concentrated in the general POL CUBA–<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and POL 1 CUBA–<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> files. POL 33–4 CUBA–<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is the file for the dispute over Cuban fishermen in U.S. waters that escalated into the Guantanamo water crisis. Haitian documents in the central files are spread over a <pb n="XV" xml:id="pg_XV" facs="0015"/>variety of files, the most significant of which is POL HAI–<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, the general file for U.S.-Haitian relations. For British Guiana (after 1966 Guyana) a variety of central files were useful. The ones most cited in the volume are POL 7 GUYANA, covering the visit of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Linden Burnham</persName> to the United States, POL 14 BR GU dealing with elections in the colony before independence, and POL 15 BR GU the general file for the government of the then British colony. There is also a specific file for the colonial government of British Guiana, POL 19 BR GU, which was also of use. All the central files consulted and cited in the volume are in the list of sources with an explanation of what topics or issues they cover.</p>
                <p>The editors also did extensive research in the Departmentʼs “lot” files. By far the most significant was a file that is still under the custody of the Department of State, the <gloss target="#t_INRIL1">INR/IL</gloss> Historical Files: the Departmentʼs files on intelligence issues, liaison with the Central Intelligence Agency, and covert operations. Without access to this collection, this volume would have been incomplete. These files were crucial for all four chapters—Dominican Republic, Cuba, Haiti, and Guyana. Also of special significance were the following office files of Assistant Secretaries for Inter-American Affairs: Lot 66 D 65, Lot 70 D 150, and Lot 70 D 295. The Inter-American Affairs Bureauʼs files for the Caribbean, <gloss target="#t_ARACAR1">ARA/CAR</gloss>, Lot 69 D 158, and the Files for the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs, <gloss target="#t_ARACCA1">ARA/CCA</gloss> Files, Lot 73 D 191, were also of special value. Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>ʼs memoranda of conversations for 1964, Lot 65 D 330, and the Policy Planning Staffʼs files, <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/P Files, Lot 72 D 139, were also of note. All lot files consulted and cited in the volume are in the list of sources.</p>
                <p>The files of the Central Intelligence Agency were a crucial source for this volume. In the case of the Dominican Republic and Cuba, accounts of many key inter-agency meetings—including meetings with the President—were found only in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> files. These were in the Director of Central Intelligence (<persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>) Files, Job 80–B01285A, and Executive Registry Files, Job 80–R01580R and Job 80–B016776R. The National Intelligence Center (NIC) Files, Job 79–R01012A, provided access to National Intelligence Estimates and Special Intelligence Estimates and related documents.

                <head>Note on U.S. Covert Actions</head>
                <p>In compliance with the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> statute that requires inclusion in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series of comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy decisions and actions, the editors have identified key documents regarding major covert actions and intelligence activities. The following note will provide readers with some organizational context on how covert actions and special intelligence operations in support of U.S. foreign policy were planned and approved within the U.S. Government. It describes, on the basis of declassified documents, the changing and developing procedures during the Truman, Eisenhower, <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName>, and <persName>Johnson</persName> Presidencies.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft">
                    <hi rend="italic">Management of Covert Actions in the Truman Presidency</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Truman administrationʼs concern over Soviet “psychological warfare” prompted the new National Security Council to authorize, in NSC 4-A of December 1947, the launching of peacetime covert action operations. NSC 4-A made the Director of Central Intelligence responsible for psychological warfare, establishing at the same time the principle that covert action was an exclusively Executive Branch function. The Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>) certainly was a natural choice but it was assigned this function at least in part because the Agency controlled unvouchered funds, by which operations could be funded with minimal risk of exposure in Washington.<note n="1" xml:id="actionsstatementfn1">NSC 4-A, December 17, 1947, is printed in <ref target="frus1945-50Intel#d257">
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1945–1950, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, Document 257</ref>.</note>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>ʼs early use of its new covert action mandate dissatisfied officials at the Departments of State and Defense. The Department of State, believing this role too important to be left to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> alone and concerned that the military might create a new rival covert action office in the Pentagon, pressed to reopen the issue of where responsibility for covert action activities should reside. Consequently, on June 18, 1948, a new NSC directive, NSC 10/2, superseded NSC 4-A.</p>
                <p>NSC 10/2 directed <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to conduct “covert” rather than merely “psychological” operations, defining them as all activities “which are conducted or sponsored by this Government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and executed that any <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and that if uncovered the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.”</p>
                <pb n="XXXII" xml:id="pg_XXXII" facs="0032"/>
                <p>The type of clandestine activities enumerated under the new directive included: “propaganda; economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage, demolition and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee liberations [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world. Such operations should not include armed conflict by recognized military forces, espionage, counter-espionage, and cover and deception for military operations.”<note n="2" xml:id="actionsstatementfn2">NSC 10/2, June 18, 1948, printed <ref target="frus1945-50Intel#d292">ibid., Document 292</ref>.</note>
                </p>
                <p>The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), newly established in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> on September 1, 1948, in accordance with NSC 10/2, assumed responsibility for organizing and managing covert actions. OPC, which was to take its guidance from the Department of State in peacetime and from the military in wartime, initially had direct access to the State Department and to the military without having to proceed through <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>ʼs administrative hierarchy, provided the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) was informed of all important projects and decisions.<note n="3" xml:id="actionsstatementfn3">Memorandum of conversation by Frank G. Wisner, “Implementation of NSC-10/2,” August 12, 1948, printed ibid., <ref target="#d298">Document 298</ref>.</note> In 1950 this arrangement was modified to ensure that policy guidance came to OPC through the DCI.</p>
                <p>During the Korean conflict the OPC grew quickly. Wartime commitments and other missions soon made covert action the most expensive and bureaucratically prominent of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>ʼs activities. Concerned about this situation, DCI Walter Bedell Smith in early 1951 asked the NSC for enhanced policy guidance and a ruling on the proper “scope and magnitude” of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> operations. The White House responded with two initiatives. In April 1951 President Truman created the Psychological Strategy Board (PSB) under the NSC to coordinate government-wide psychological warfare strategy. NSC 10/5, issued in October 1951, reaffirmed the covert action mandate given in NSC 10/2 and expanded <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>ʼs authority over guerrilla warfare.<note n="4" xml:id="actionsstatementfn4">NSC 10/5, “Scope and Pace of Covert Operations,” October 23, 1951, in Michael Warner, editor, <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Under Harry Truman</hi> (Washington, D.C.: Central Intelligence Agency, 1994), pp. 437–439.</note> The PSB was soon abolished by the incoming Eisenhower administration, but the expansion of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>ʼs covert action writ in NSC 10/5 helped ensure that covert action would remain a major function of the Agency.</p>
                <p>As the Truman administration ended, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was near the peak of its independence and authority in the field of covert action.

                <p>The Eisenhower administration began narrowing <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>ʼs latitude in 1954. In accordance with a series of National Security Council directives, the responsibility of the Director of Central Intelligence for the conduct of covert operations was further clarified. President Eisenhower approved NSC 5412 on March 15, 1954, reaffirming the Central Intelligence Agencyʼs responsibility for conducting covert actions abroad. A definition of covert actions was set forth; the DCI was made responsible for coordinating with designated representatives of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense to ensure that covert operations were planned and conducted in a manner consistent with U.S. foreign and military policies; and the Operations Coordinating Board was designated the normal channel for coordinating support for covert operations among State, Defense, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Representatives of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the President were to be advised in advance of major covert action programs initiated by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> under this policy and were to give policy approval for such programs and secure coordination of support among the Departments of State and Defense and the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.<note n="5" xml:id="actionsstatementfn5">

NSC 5412/2 of December 28, 1955, assigned to representatives (of the rank of assistant secretary) of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the President responsibility for coordinating covert actions. By the end of the Eisenhower administration, this group, which became known as the “NSC 5412/2 Special Group” or simply “Special Group,” emerged as the executive body to review and approve covert action programs initiated by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.<note n="6" xml:id="actionsstatementfn6">

                <p>After the Bay of Pigs failure in April 1961, General Maxwell Taylor reviewed U.S. paramilitary capabilities at President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName>ʼs request and submitted a report in June that recommended strengthening high-level direction of covert operations.

Until 1963 the DCI determined whether a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-originated project was submitted to the Special Group. In 1963 the Special Group developed general but informal criteria, including risk, possibility of success, potential for exposure, political sensitivity, and cost (a threshold of $25,000 was adopted by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>), for determining whether covert action projects were submitted to the Special Group.<note n="8" xml:id="actionsstatementfn8">Ibid., p. 82.</note>

When President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> authorized the program in November, he designated Brigadier General Edward G.

                        <p rend="center">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>We believe that the security forces of the Dominican Republic can control any subversive activities likely to occur during the next few months. Nevertheless, leftist leaders probably can increase hit-and-run terrorism in urban areas and, over time, may be able to resume guerrilla activity in the mountains. If they show ability to sustain such operations, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> will probably supply them clandestinely with small amounts of material aid, and they may attract the support of other Dominican elements, including erstwhile moderates. Thus, over the longer run, the insurgency danger could increase, perhaps sharply. This development would be facilitated if the regime failed to show progress in meeting demands for restoration of political freedoms and for social and economic reforms.</p>

About 50 percent of the land is arable and the ratio of population to land is favorable. The population of about 3.3 million is 13 percent white, 67 percent mulatto, and 20 percent negro; 64 percent of the adult population is literate. The economy remains underdeveloped (GNP: <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>$780 million, $236 per capita) and heavily dependent upon exports of sugar, coffee, and cocoa. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> is one of the Latin American countries least prepared for representative government. Its past has been characterized by a succession of foreign occupations, coups, and despotic administrations. In particular, the thirty years of Trujilloʼs <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0037"/>dictatorship, ended only by his assassination in 1961, warped the political and economic framework of the country. Over the years, many Dominicans have come to doubt that they can accomplish anything by themselves; there are few who have the experience, honesty, and backbone to play effective roles as government leaders.</item>

                            <item>Along with this unfortunate political legacy, Trujillo left an economic jumble of major proportions. His economic policies were designed primarily to funnel funds into the coffers of the Trujillo family. As a result, most of the enterprises now operating in the Dominican Republic are unsound, having inefficient administration structures and swollen payrolls. The Haina sugar complex, the Dominican Republicʼs most important producer for export, is a case in point. Moreover, some of the countryʼs best land—formerly Trujillo-owned—is still lying fallow.</item>

Although <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> began with a strong popular mandate, he did not consolidate his electoral victory by decisive and constructive action. On the one hand, he failed to attract the cooperation of influential opposition elements in the business community, among the large property owners, in the military and church hierarchies; on the other hand, he failed to organize his mass popular following into an effective supporting political force. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> reacted vigorously against Communists and Castroists only when he thought they posed direct challenges to his own position. His refusal to adopt a strong anti-Communist posture left him vulnerable to rightist pressure for his removal.

                            <item>In the political field, the regime has taken a strong anti-Communist and anti-Castroist position and has acted to curb Communist and other extreme leftist activities. Under much press, internal and external, to hold elections soon, it has announced a five-phase scheme which would begin with several limited local elections and put off national congressional and presidential elections until mid–1965. Government spokesmen claim that the plan would provide “do-it-yourself” <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0039"/>training for the populace in democratic procedures; the earthier motivation seems to be the opportunity it might afford for parties participating in the regime to improve their machinery and expand their following. It would be likely, however, to have an unsettling impact on the general political situation; beginning with the campaigning for the elections at the lowest local level in the fall of 1964, there would be voting every two or three months—and electioneering almost constantly—until the summer of 1965.</item>

The triumvirate has no independent base of support, is unable to exercise effective control over the actions of the military and police, and is subject to pressure from many sides. The Dominican military leaders retain the power to remove it at any time. Moreover, the triumvirate has been under fire from the extreme right as well as from the left, the ultrarightists accusing it, among other things, of failing to act vigorously enough to expel “Communists” from official positions.</item>

                            <item>The 14th of June Political Group (<gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss>) is the most potent of the organizations of the extreme left.<note n="7" xml:id="d1fn7">The other parties of the extreme left are the orthodox Communist Partido Socialista Popular Dominicano (<gloss target="#t_PSPD1">PSPD</gloss>); the heterodox Communist Partido Nacionalista Revolucionario (PNR); and the Communist-dominated, pro-Castro Movimiento Popular Dominicano (<gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss>). Other, comparatively moderate, leftist parties are <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>) and the bitterly anti-<persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> Partido Revolucionario Social Cristiano (<gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>). [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Its members and supporters probably number several thousand; this contrasts with the Communist-Castroist Dominican Popular Movement (<gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss>) and the regular Dominican Communist Party, which command the support of no more than a few hundred. The <gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss> benefits from its role as a nonpartisan underground group which fought against Trujillo. Ever since the extreme leftists gained control of the group in 1961, after Trujilloʼs death, it has planned for eventual subversive and guerrilla action. Since its resort to active insurgency, it has been outlawed by the government.</item>

                            <item>The <gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss> has been the dominant force behind the guerrilla effort in the countryside as well as the frequent but ineffective bombings in the cities. A few members of the <gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss> have also been directly involved and others may have assisted in procuring weapons. Some of the captured insurgents have denied any Communist allegiance and insisted they were fighting simply for a return to constitutional government.</item>

                            <item>The total number of active guerrilla fighters was about 200, organized into six small groups in various mountainous areas of the country.<note n="8" xml:id="d1fn8">As in Cuba, the terrain is favorable for guerrilla warfare. See map. [Footnote in the source text. The map is not reproduced.]</note> The groups were not well prepared for any serious fighting and did not take any offensive action. They apparently hoped they could quickly attract significant support from other disaffected civilian and military elements. This was not the case. The governmentʼs security forces have managed to mop up almost all of them and to scatter the others. Manuel Tavares Justo, the principal <gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss> leader, and several other key <gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss> figures have been killed.</item>

A few <gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss> members had earlier received guerrilla warfare training in Cuba. Havana press and radio were quick to provide propaganda support to the “insurrection” and to quote the <gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss>ʼs claims about its scope. We have no firm evidence that the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime has, as yet, furnished material support to the Dominican insurgents, but <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> would probably <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0041"/>supply them clandestinely with small amounts of such aid if they appeared capable of sustaining a program of violent opposition. The short distance involved—less than 200 miles from eastern Cuba to the western part of the Dominican Republic—would facilitate clandestine supply operations by small boat or by aircraft.</item>

                            <item>The Dominican Republicʼs security forces are considerably more able and better equipped than is typically the case for a small Latin American country. Total strength of the military and security forces is 28,100: 10,500 in the army, 1,700 in the armed forces training center (which has the armor), 3,700 in the air force, 3,100 in the navy, and 9,100 in the national police. The army has three counterinsurgency-trained battalions, and the air force has two counterguerrilla security squadrons. Dominican personnel have received specialized counterinsurgency training from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> instructors, and the national police has expanded its program of training for riot control. Key weaknesses affecting the overall capability of the Dominican military are insufficient field training and inadequate communications and transportation equipment.</item>

                            <item>For the immediate future at least, the leftists pose no serious threat to seize control. The present regime, in one form or another, may be able to hold on to power for an indefinite period. If this does not prove to be the case, the most likely alternative would be an extreme rightist government established through a direct military takeover. This might take place if the triumvirate resigned under pressure; it might come about as a military response to charges by ultrarightists that the present administration is soft on communism; it might occur through an increase in friction among the leading military men and a decision by one or more to take full control. The resulting new government would be even less likely than the present one to fulfill domestic demands for reform.</item>

                            <item>In any case, the extreme leftists will probably concentrate for the time being on trying to increase terrorism in urban areas, hoping gradually to build a new capability for guerrilla actions at a later date. Much of their support comes from the youth in the cities. They could almost certainly step up their bombing program; they might also undertake <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0042"/>occasional shooting affrays, acts of arson, and other destructive measures. They may be able to attract additional Dominican supporters by exploiting a martyrdom issue; the belief has become widespread that the military, in one of its mop-up operations, murdered insurgents who had surrendered.</item>
                            <label>21.</label>
                            <item>Perhaps the leftistsʼ strongest card is the instability of the present regime and the magnitude of the problems that face it. These include the difficulty such a regime is likely to have in convincing the populace that it intends to undertake constructive social and economic programs and to provide for an eventual return to representative government. Some friction is probable among top-level military officers, along with a gradual increase in restiveness on the part of middle-ranking and junior officers. If official harassment of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and other opposition parties continues, there will almost certainly be a tendency for some of the moderate civilian opponents of the regime to shift to a sharper opposition role. The extreme leftistsʼ program of violent resistance might attract such erstwhile moderates. Thus, over the longer run, the present limited threat of insurgency could increase sharply.</item>

                        <p>Attached is a memorandum which I received from a businessman who has been a close observer of the Dominican scene since before the <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> election.<note n="2" xml:id="d2fn2">Not found.</note> I have found him to be a reliable reporter in the past, although he has relatively few contacts and is therefore weak on student labor and popular democratic parties. He did not get out in the countryside during his recent trip.</p>
                        <p>This report plus the traffic which I have seen in recent weeks suggests to me that it is time we sat down to map out a program for the Dominican Republic which is geared to developments that are occurring there since the coup. I would suggest that a draft plan of action be prepared by the Desk which could be reviewed here in Washington <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0043"/>before <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> goes down to Santo Domingo.<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> was appointed Ambassador to the Dominican Republic on March 4 and presented his credentials on March 23.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> might take this plan down and test it against his own appraisal of the situation as he observes it.</p>

                        <p>Obviously, the situation is extremely fluid and could go in a number of different directions. One of these is a deterioration in political and economic conditions which could lead to a <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>-type takeover. In short, I believe that we must develop a plan which has a positive objective and not simply react to the situation as it develops. I recognize that the formulation of a plan and development of a program to implement it is not a guarantee against deterioration.<note n="4" xml:id="d2fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> responded to Dungan in a February 12 memorandum in which he agreed that a plan of action for the Dominican Republic should be readied for discussion with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> and stated that “one is now being developed.” This plan of action, however, has not been identified.

                        <p>There is enclosed a memorandum of a recent conversation between two leaders of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquín Balaguer</persName>ʼs Partido Reformista and an Embassy officer.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">The attached memorandum of conversation, February 14, among Augusto Lora, President of the Partido Reformista, <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Hector Garcia Godoy</persName> of the Partido Reformista, and Political Officer <persName corresp="#p_SHW1">Harry Shlaudeman</persName> is not printed.</note> The balagueristas alleged the existence of a plot on the part of <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0044"/>Rafael Bonnelly, Ramón Tapia,<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3">Rafael Bonnelly was President of the Dominican Republic and of the Council of State that governed the Republic from 1962 until February 27, 1963. Ramón Tapia was Secretary of State for Presidency under the Council of State, 1962–February 27, 1963, and member of the Triumvirate after <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>ʼs overthrow in September 25, 1963.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Antonio Imbert</persName> and others to depose Triumvirate President <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Donald Reid Cabral</persName> as a means of preventing the issuance of a law granting general political amnesty and the consequent return to the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is inclined to doubt that Bonnelly and Tapia are contemplating another golpe. However, the balaguerista charges are another indication that serious dissension has arisen within the <gloss target="#t_GODR1">GODR</gloss> over the amnesty issue and the problem of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> had correctly sensed the political necessity for some kind of amnesty gesture and, in all probability, sees it as a means of advancing his own political fortunes. (<persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> continues to stand surprisingly high with a good part of the opposition which sees him as better intentioned and more honest than his colleagues.) On the other side Tapia (and probably <persName>Manuel Tavares</persName>), backed by <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and the radical right of Rafael <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> Aybar oppose any concessions at this time to political prisoners and exiles. Unión Cívica Nacional favors a limited amnesty but bitterly objects to extending it to the partyʼs old enemy <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. In all, the amnesty issue carries with it the elements of a political crisis, one that could be on us shortly if <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is serious in his plan to pass a law February 27.</p>

                                <p>On conclusion of my first eight weeks in this tormented country, Dept will perhaps be interested to have from me a preliminary analysis of the situation here and its portents for United States policy.</p>

                                <p>During this period since late March the country has been rocked by three major crises, two of which were political and either of which could easily have ended in a military takeover. One did end with change in governing triumvirate. Govt is attempting to face up to financial crisis, and some initial measures have been taken; but we are still in early stretch of long road. Sufficient to say that with crises recurring so constantly little gets done. Political malaise is perhaps more serious than economic, and the various forces emerge from one crisis to prepare for the next.</p>

                            <item>In this 8–week period American preference has been fully reestablished here. While our personnel situation is still seriously short, we are gradually, perhaps too slowly, building back to strength of last [garble—July?]. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Mission has been reactivated, as has <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, and both new chiefs are now assembling staffs.</item>

                            <item>We have been involved in considerable substantive activity, when we could find a day quiet enough to take action. Such projects <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0047"/>as 4-million-dollar EXIM Bank loan for road maintenance machinery, 900–unit workersʼ housing in San Pedro de Macoris, 600–unit middle-class housing in Santo Domingo and release for on-going projects of funds totaling more than $1.1 million to assist educational activities, labor cooperatives, etc., have been signed or announced. Numerous scholarships and travel grants covering wide variety of interests and training have been put in motion. I have given a number of formal speeches, together with many informal talks, and have made three major trips to north and east sections of the country, plus shorter trips to nearby towns and in and around the capital. I have also visited numerous Peace Corps volunteers on station, including several who live in the most depressing slum areas of Santo Domingo and Santiago and whose work in a broad range of fields cannot be praised too highly. All these activities have been well received and have received appropriate publicity.</item>

                                <p>Quite aside from govt contacts—and there is almost daily exchange here with top level due to informal atmosphere in which triumvirate governs and the seeming necessity of getting even minor decisions made by them—there have been conferences, meetings and discussions with professional, cultural, business, agricultural, political and military leaders and with labor and youth groups. In short, the country knows we are back in business here. Written and spoken comments at all levels and representing all sectors of opinion (except Communist) indicate great relief and satisfaction that U.S. is back.</p>
                                <p>Economic Misery</p>

                                <p>As a result of sampling this wide cross section of Dominican opinion, I am convinced that countryʼs major interest at the moment is finding jobs and food, i.e. getting on with economic development. With perhaps a third of the working force unemployed and many others underemployed, urban slums I have visited are Asian-like in their overcrowding and squalor (they lack even such basic necessities as water, sanitation, and garbage collection). They are seething with unrest and frustration. Economic misery, as distinct from political tyranny, strikes me as much more prevalent now (drift to cities dramatizes it, of course) than when I served in this country over twenty years ago during the Trujillo period.</p>
                                <p>Political Apathy</p>
                            </item>

                                <p>One of the things which has impressed me most in my travels and conversations about the country has been the almost total lack of interest in talking politics with me. This excepts, of course, the several party leaders here in the capital whose profession it is to keep the waters boiling. In conversations with others, however, the more sophisticated emphasize development needs and propose projects, large and small, government and private. Less educated people stress jobs and <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0048"/>housing. I am repeatedly surprised at how rarely politics comes up. On two separate visits to San Pedro de Macoris, for instance, which offered informal talks with full range of income groups from top to bottom, not once was a political matter mentioned. Despite shrillness of individual political leaders, each of whom has his devoted cadre of actilarts and some of whom have no further following, most observers agree the country is largely apathetic at this time as regards political matters. This does not mean, however, that Dominican politicians are going to give up playing politics.</p>
                                <p>Leftward Drift</p>
                            </item>

                                <p>On other hand, the poor and the unemployed, most of whom scrape through on a minimum subsistence diet and have trouble even getting water, while not active politically, appear to be steadily drifting leftward in their sympathies. They are, of course, on receiving end of heavy stream of radio and word-of-mouth propaganda from extreme left. My Peace Corps friends who live in slum areas tell us that many of their neighbors sympathize with Castroite 14th of June movement. Comments made to me on my own visits to these sections indicate, despite the appealing simplicity and easy friendliness which still characterizes the average Dominican, a general sense of abandonment at hands of society. Perverted as it is in its aims, the 14th of June at least shows interest in their misery and promises them help.</p>
                                <p>Lack of National Purpose</p>

                                <p>Disorders (including bomb tossing and stone throwing in such normally quiet provincial towns as La Vega) during recent taxi drivers strike, which had no economic justification and was in fact a political effort manipulated by both right and left for separate (but often converging) ends, showed how close to the surface violence is in Dominican life today and how tension grips rich, poor and govt authority alike and influences their actions toward extremism. Part of this represents general spirit of revolt against authority—any authority—which is aftermath of long Trujillo tyranny; and part unfortunately represents those more endemic Dominican characteristics of inordinate suspicion one of another and lack of sense of national purpose (despite homogeneous population) or feeling of individual responsibility to act in national interest—traits which have so often been commented on over the years by observers of the local scene. The difference now is that time is shorter than it was.</p>

                            <item>Given the above factual situation, what should be the U.S. posture? My own conviction after eight years here is that we have less time even than we thought during Washington consultations in March. If we are to influence Dominicans in ways we want to see them go and counter leftist efforts to poison popular mind, we must lose no time in <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0049"/>getting under way with full-scale Alliance for Progress program. Despite rather somber picture drawn above, I do not believe body politic here is as yet deeply infected with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>-Communist venom, notwithstanding intensive efforts mentioned above. There is rather touching trust and faith that the United States can solve all Dominican problems; there is, in fact, over-dependence on us.</item>

                                <p>The time for us to act is now. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_CAE1">Carter</persName> Ide is presently in Washington, and I hope he can be given urgent and sympathetic support in getting approval of program along lines worked out during his recent consultation here. We believe emphasis should be in fields of (1) agriculture (agricultural productivity has simply got to be increased to meet needs of rapidly increasing population and to offset effects of measures to counter balance of payments problem) and (2) education, but with sufficient flexibility to take on desirable projects that may be offered in other fields. There is critical need to put people to work here, and we should have some impact projects of sufficient scope to be impressive and have effect on local consciousness.</p>
                                <p>Support for Self-Help</p>
                            </item>

                            <item>
                                <p>Our program should place stress on encouraging and assisting self-help efforts of Dominican Govt and private entities and to maximum extent feasible should be implemented step by step as needed reforms are instituted. While many activities necessarily have to be carried out in conjunction with govt, we should make strong effort to avoid tying ourselves too directly to any one administration or any one group. To extent we can do so in accord with sound operational and fiscal procedures, we should seek to work with communities and with private professional, business and labor groups. In that connection, one of most hopeful aspects of local scene involves Community Development Associations which are now being organized all over the country and which are anxious to work with us. These associations are being sparked by the excellent Santiago Committee, which is worthy of similar activity in an American city of its size and already has a number of positive successes to its credit. These efforts indicate that at long last at least some Dominican citizens are becoming aware of their private responsibilities for public progress. Labor organizations and agricultural cooperatives also offer possibilities as suitable vehicles for direct cooperation. We should encourage them. In short, we must tie our programs to people and local initiative and act so as to convince the entirety of the Dominican public that the American people and Govt have an abiding interest in their progress toward social betterment and higher standards of living.</p>

                                <p>What are the political effects of all this? We cannot forget—and we should not let Dominicans forget—that the standards of this <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0050"/>hemisphere require Dominican Republic to work its way back to constitutional govt. At the present time, however, except for self-serving declarations of political leaders, most of whom agree only on getting the ins out and wishing themselves in national palace, there is widespread popular apathy. Not one of the various political leaders with whom I have talked gives the impression of having national stature or being capable of giving this country leadership needed. This includes present leadership of the democratic left.</p>

                            <item>Oddly enough, the two individuals most often mentioned and credited with stature of presidential possibilities are outside the country, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> in Puerto Rico and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName> in New York. As for <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, his own political party, whatever its public posture, is by no means united in desiring his return, there is no widespread public demand for it. And quite apart from whether Dominican armed forces would or would not agree to his coming back, there are sound grounds for believing that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> himself much prefers the comfortable martyrdom of Puerto Rican exile to the pains and aches involved in attempting to govern this distressingly ungovernable country. Those who know <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> best hold that he has no intention of attempting a comeback.

                                    <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> may well represent at this time the largest common denominator of support for the Presidency, since he has the large <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> party behind him and enjoys the backing of important right wing elements in the armed forces and the church and at least some popular favor within groups such as the taxi drivers to whom he gave free taxicabs during his previous incumbency. (He also has bitter enemies who threaten his assassination in event of his return.) However, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs proven combination of political charlatanry and economic profligacy, together with his record of close association with the Trujillo dynasty, would scarcely seem to recommend his as in the U.S. interest. In final analysis it is not so much <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs personal qualities that make him undesirable. It is fact that his return would open way for re-imposition throughout country of interlocking Trujillo mechanism of governing. It is still less than three years since Trujillo. Those people are still around and they are anxious for another chance.</p>

                            <item>That brings us to <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Donald Reid Cabral</persName>, leading member of the governing triumvirate and professedly apolitical. I have not the slightest doubt that <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid Cabral</persName> has the smell of politics deep in his nostrils. He has already begun maneuvers to find his way to a longer term, <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0051"/>preferably alone and preferably constitutional if he can find a formula. These intentions are already suspected of him by his peers, and there will be increased rumblings, together with efforts to block him, as his presumed intentions become clearer. It is perhaps worth bearing in mind in that connection that he is not the first interim Latin American leader nor, it can be safely wagered, will he be the last to conclude he is the man to lead his country onward.</item>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is something of a bantam cock in personality, is strong-willed and impulsive and is at times erratic; he is not well organized personally, with the result that plans and promises often outrun performance. There is a great deal of spur-of-the-moment shifting of gears. However, there seems no doubt of his good intentions nor of his strong desire to improve conditions in his country. He does not lack for personal courage and he is personally honest. He greatly admires the United States and its way of life. While lacking a “popular” background (he will always be subject to the charge of belonging to the oligarchy) and not a rabble-rouser, he can be effective in a crowd; he was, for instance, impressive at a large labor gathering on May Day in which I participated. In sum, from standpoint U.S. interests we could do a lot worse in a country like this in which there is such a paucity of possibilities.</p>

                                <p>As an interim executive <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> suffers from the stain of political illegitimacy and he can expect no help from the practicing politicians in removing it or forgetting it. However, if he can prove himself to the people in the months ahead and earn their support for an acceptable formula for return to constitutionality, I see no grounds on which the United States should object. The trick, in light of the political jockeying and plotting which goes on incessantly behind the scenes here, will be for <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> to gain the months in which to prove he can do something for the people and earn their support, i.e. fill todayʼs vacuum of popular support with himself.</p>

According to his political opposition, <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs radio speech of May 15 has had effect of causing parties to intensify their efforts find unity on single national candidate so as to increase pressure for elections. Given nature of party and individual rivalries this would be neatest trick of week, but if such efforts should prosper result might be turn toward <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0052"/>Or an individual might be found whose name has thus far not appeared in speculation. Certain it is that, regardless of extent of political apathy in country at large, party leaders have no intention of giving triumvirate any peace or tranquillity. Giving the matter a purely pragmatic view, however, so long as <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> holds the support of the armed forces he will have his office and his opportunity. At present he has that support, and he works hard to keep it.</p>

                                <p>Given the realities of the military position in the DOM Rep, <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is in fact in the midst of a most discreet operation. He is softly stroking the military in hopes it will purr in response; so far it is docile, although it is an uncertain and dangerous instrument. He is simultaneously engaged in the delicate task of (1) reducing Trujillista influence (still strong, and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>–oriented) and (2) removing from the general military establishment some of the undue privileges it enjoys, while at the same time striving to prevent a split among the several different factions which could easily deteriorate into armed conflict with unforeseeable consequences for the country. It is possible, of course, that he may slip off this tight rope and fall into the military pocket. It is quite probable that it will look that way from time to time, but I believe he is alert to this danger. In my opinion he deserves our sympathetic understanding in his effort to work out a more rational place in Dominican society for the men with the guns. He deserves it the more in view of the constant effort of some political elements to serve their own ends by inciting the military to more active intrusion in the affairs of state.</p>

                            <item>If our own activities meet with success—and we have a staff with good teamwork and high morale which is prepared to work hard at the job—some of this success will perhaps rub off on govt in power (as will failures). There is no way to get away from fact that any positive program our part will be taken by many as evidence our support of whatever regime in power at time. However, to serve our long-range interests in this country, I repeat the view that we should insofar as we can avoid tying our program to any one individual or administration and base it as much as possible on broad cooperation with private groups and community activities. Our approach should remain sufficiently flexible to enable us to cut loose from any particular govt formula that may develop badly. We should never cease to stress publicly that our activities are long-range and our interest the welfare of the whole Dominican people.</item>

Rather it seems to me we are faced with meeting each dayʼs problems as they arise, measuring them against our constant objectives and tackling them on that basis. We shall be misunderstood, and we shall be attacked by those who want revolution immediately and by those who want no changes at all. Our daily fare will probably contain as much failure as success, but with luck we may advance a bit now and then. Our problem is largely one of infusing as much reason as possible into an atmosphere in which reason has been resisted and defied for most of history.</item>

                            <item>With sufficient commitment on our part I believe the problem here is manageable, although I do not underestimate the difficulties and the uncertain prospects. We learned all too recently here that we do not, despite our great influence, have the last word; we are dealing with human material which does not always respond logically or even in its own long-range interests. When the chips are down it is the Dominicans who make their own final decisions—largely on the basis of their own self-generated pressures.</item>

                            <item>There are many larger problems than the Dominican one, and many which would appear to be basically more insoluble. But the Dominican Republic is on our doorstep and, let us have no illusions, the Dominican problem is urgent.</item>

                            <item>We have become increasingly concerned in recent days over behavior of <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid Cabral</persName>.

                            <item>In past two weeks it has become increasingly difficult to have serious conversation with <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>, and his tendency hear only what he wants to hear has grown more marked. I have found this myself and a variety of contacts both local and foreign report similarly. He is apparently listening to no one and brooks no advice, even from old friends and well wishers. He is driving himself to exhaustion with attention to every detail of administration while at same time rushing about over the country in his “vigorous program” and making all manner of promises for grandiose projects which cannot possibly be filled in any reasonable time. Both Nuncio and British Chargé have commented to me on his irascibility in conversation. All elements of Mission are receiving reports similar to above, and we have had several local approaches this week asking us to “talk to Donnie.”</item>

                            <item>Hal Hendrix, for instance, told me yesterday he fed up with <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> and returning to Miami to write story for Scripps-Howard which he says will “cause Donnie to strike me off his list of friends.” Hendrix expressed himself as thoroughly disillusioned with <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> and local situation and seemed particularly upset over evidences of broad extent graft and corruption he found pervading local scene. He did not accuse triumvirate personally of this, but various American and foreign businessmen resident here for many years have approached me and other members of staff in recent days to express their view that graft worse now than under Trujillo. There is marked increase of complaint and triumvirate being held responsible even if not personally involved.</item>

His cocky overconfidence has grown apace. I believe this is due to a variety of factors: his elation over his govtʼs success in handling recent taxi strike and the approving <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> editorial in <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0055"/>connection therewith, on top of his feeling which he has expressed to more than one visiting newsman that he now has both Dominican armed forces and U.S. Govt in his pocket.</item>

                            <item>I believe he has overestimated our recognition of his regime, favorable decisions on several economic matters coincident with first weeks of new U.S. Ambassadorʼs presence in country and support he justifiably received in connection taxi strike. He seems to have taken all this to mean that he has full U.S. support to do what he pleases on political scene (including some highly dubious radio censorship actions, and ominous complaints beginning to emanate from high sources about press criticism of regime actions). He appears, despite cautionary talk from me, to be convinced his promises will be paid for by us (his aid ideas are obviously exaggerated). It is becoming a matter of conjecture among the informed as to how long this can go on unless <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Donald Reid</persName> can be pulled back off this kick.</item>

(Both in National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–9 DOM REP)</note> mutterings within armed forces. These are continuing. Yesterdayʼs and todayʼs papers carried stories of “subversive group” discovered within police (we understand <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> participated personally in grilling of enlisted personnel involved). As of now our attachés do not regard <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs military support so united and secure as <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> apparently thinks.</item>

                            <item>I believe most effective step that can be taken at this time would be for you to have frank and vigorous talk with <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> has strong influence on <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> and, as we know, has steadily encouraged him in his political aspirations. We feel here that <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> often misleads <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> (witness IMF discussions) and that his reporting seriously offsets our efforts here. So long as <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is being fed overoptimistic accounts by <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName>, as we believe, about his (<persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs) high standing in Washington and U.S. Govtʼs readiness to back him all the way, I am afraid our efforts here to put matters in perspective are lightly regarded and taken with resentment.</item>

                            <item>I urge you to see <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> without delay and stress our concern over trend of situation here. You could take as point of departure Deptʼs surprise over <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs statements to press during recent Samana visit that new port works would be built with Alliance, i.e. U.S. money (without slightest mention of project before or after to Embassy) and his comments reported front page yesterdayʼs papers following our June 3 meeting primarily for IMF matters but during which he listed without discussion some of projects he expected U.S. pay for (para 6 <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss>

                            <item>I hope you can talk with <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> over weekend so that his report can reach <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> before our Monday<note n="7" xml:id="d6fn7">June 8.</note> meeting (which I shall attempt postpone until Tuesday). I expect hard knuckled discussion in view <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs exhilarated state and am fully prepared do my part in making him face facts. It should be made clear to <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> that we cannot do business on basis of <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> promising and then expecting us to pick up the check (he devoted table-pounding emphasis in June 3 discussion to what he “deserves” in way of U.S. aid) and that Alliance program is meant to raise living standards rather than serve as political vehicle. It could also be stressed that U.S. does not wish be associated in eyes of public (as we are being more and more tied in with <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> in local opinion) with govt in which graft and corruption so rampant—and growing according to all reports of those who have to do business on local scene. Shaking <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> up would, I hope, have effect of infusing a little more reality into <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>. You will have to douse <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> with ice water for it to come out cold on <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>. I donʼt want to exaggerate in view paucity of alternatives here. However, unless we can get <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> back on path, and quickly, I am afraid all signs point to serious trouble.</item>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> reported that DOM financial delegation has now reached full meeting of minds with IMF and believes stand-by can be signed June 8. (We have not yet been able confirm this with IMF and have no details on what specifics agreement may entail.) In response this good news, <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> emphasized that stand-by only first step on difficult road; that agreement will only prove beneficial if Triumvirate now hews line on fiscal and other reform measures necessary to put DOM economic house in order.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>This led to point that Triumvirateʼs very raison dʼetre is its presumed capacity to take difficult measures for good of nation without undue regard for transitory political considerations. It was recalled that Council of State and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> regimes proved reluctant to grapple with countryʼs real problems because of political pressures but that Triumvirate has publicly recognized that it has no excuses this regard.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>At same time U.S. fully aware of difficulties faced by Triumvirate, particularly severe pressures created by widespread unemployment. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs anxiety to show visible, immediate results in terms of public works projects therefore understandable. Nevertheless, in our <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0058"/>opinion, would be error of first magnitude to pump money into employment-creating projects of this type which did not at same time increase countryʼs capacity to produce. Result would be compounding of current financial problem which has its roots in excess of consumption in relation to production.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Referring to <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs extravagant and misleading promises re U.S. assistance, <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> emphasized that aid of the type he apparently envisages cannot be justified. In addition damage it would do in terms of <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss>ʼs financial situation, building of hospitals for which there are no nurses, schools for which there are no teachers and gaudy bridges for which there is no need would be essentially wasteful. <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> was told in clearest terms that U.S. has no intention embarking on a program of this sort and that <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs statements can only cause mutual embarrassment.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>It was then explained just what U.S. does hope do: assist in raising agricultural production, in improving education, in getting country launched on constructive self-help projects, and, generally, in establishing technical and educational base for genuine development. <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> singled out <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName>ʼs own project for rural education as one which fits within framework.</item>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> reacted most favorably. Said he agreed entirely; that our approach coincided with his thinking and that these representations would strengthen his hand in attempting influence <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>. He expressed desire for interview with Asst. Sec. to go over same ground so as to be able impress <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> even more strongly.</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>Referring to <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs recent statements, <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> observed that former is inclined toward rash indiscretions and is at times victimized by bad advice, particularly from his uncles the Cabrals. <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> reviewed his own efforts over the months to prevail on <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> to lay aside empty words and make his mark with constructive action. As example, <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> asserted he had counseled <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> bring in qualified foreign economist and formulate economic policy on basis this expertʼs advice.</item>
                                <label>8.</label>
                                <item>Throughout <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> emphasized his belief that Triumvirate must adopt practical programs for promoting basic education, increasing agricultural production, encouraging small industries and attracting foreign investment. Said he would continue urge his views (which appear remarkably similar to our own) on <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>.</item>

                        <p>In forthcoming conversations with <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> we will attempt strengthen these convictions (presuming they are genuine) by discreet coaching and re-emphasis of points made today. <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> intends return Santo Domingo next week following conclusion IMF negotiations. Judging from your own estimate of his influence on <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>, he should prove helpful. You may therefore wish follow up our efforts with representations of your own after he arrives.</p>

                        <p>Much heartened by receipt your 667. We must hope <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> will talk in same way to <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> as he does to us. I believe best way to forward that project is for <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> to keep pressure on <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName>. You might go so far in this eveningʼs meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> as to suggest that, since aid discussion scheduled for tomorrow 4 p.m. between triumvirate and our team has been announced to press by <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> as “invitation of formal negotiations on program U.S. aid for DOM Rep,” it would be useful have him to advise <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> of Washington discussions before meeting here.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> took initiative yesterday to have lengthy conversation with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], later joined by other two attachés. I consider this was a most useful encounter, since they got down to brass tacks on graft, corruption in armed forces and elsewhere. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> asked for it and he got it in accord with lines worked out among us beforehand. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> was in sober state of mind and his manner indicated realization his part things not going well lately. I believe our team made some first downs.</p>
                        <p>In view <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs frank admission yesterdayʼs conversation extent of graft in local society and his professed desire to take steps to correct situation as he mentioned some definite plans being readied, I believe it would be useful for <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> to touch on this issue, as discussed paragraphs 3 and 9 my tel 1106. It is admittedly delicate subject and one hard to prove (although attachés did not fail to give <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> some specific cases yesterday), but representation could be made to <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> on grounds that aid program will lose value, as well as moral validity, and will not achieve desired results for either side if its administration is attempted in atmosphere of squandering and corruption.</p>

There is a firmly based mystique here in both govt and private circles of “magic figure” of $50 million. However illogical this figure may be, I have come to conclusion that tangible and substantive evidence now of our long-range commitment to countryʼs future and sympathetic assistance in its very real problems of development, in addition to direct and immediate need of bulwarking insofar as possible a program of fiscal reform so necessary but so politically unpalatable to country, is in our own national interest. Accordingly, I propose we <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0062"/>move urgently on <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program loan for $25 million for announcement concurrently with initiation standby-austerity program, which may be as early as next week. We realize that such dollar funds are not essential for the first stages of the stabilization program, but they will be needed during the next three to ten months if the stabilization develops as projected.</item>

                            <item>The financial program and the need for balance of payments assistance are the economic justification of the loan.

                            <item>What I have in mind is announcement which will offer dramatic evidence of our determination assist Dominican people at a time when they are seriously disturbed over direction of events, i.e., a positive U.S. approach to supplement the very negative bite of austerity measures. We are caught here in a situation which grows increasingly grave, unless we are prepared to move rapidly, we may well see changes before long which will not be in our interests.

                            <item>Nor do we consider that such a course would force the U.S. to do more than we have been thinking of. Due to inherent delays in reestablishment <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Mission here after 6 months lapse and endemic problems of Dominican bureaucracy, there has not yet been sufficient staff or time to work our programs in detail; but we have already identified fields of sound activity and specific programs (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 1065<note n="6" xml:id="d9fn6">Dated May 27. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss>) 9 DOM REP)</note> showed guide lines and work now underway to flesh this out) total of which will easily exceed figure of $25 million. When <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> in July 14 talk proposed announcement of such program together with understanding no pesos would be released except on agreed projects, Ide and I pointed out difficulties and warned that disbursement of any such funds would have to be tied to sound stabilization program and made only in step with performance under it. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> expressed full agreement with this concept. What proposed therefore is course which will offer Dominicans evidence of timely and generous U.S. policy, together with strict implementation in protection our own interests. We would spend no money until satisfied with soundness of detailed programs, but meanwhile, when needed most, we get benefit of dramatic impact of our announced intentions. I am persuaded that we tend become prisoners our own very valid planning process; by announcing each project only when it is finally and completely wrapped up, we lose public <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0063"/>relations effect of totality of our general intentions and get little or no credit for the very fine things we do. And it is not enough to put out tabulations afterwards; I have seen the yawns go up in various countries as our statistics have been issued. Here, it seems to me, we have the opportunity of maximum public effect at no cost to sound procedures. I hope this can be done.</item>

                            <item>Admittedly we would all prefer to have more time to work these things out. Situation, however, is urgent. July 1 deadline on standby was missed and Aug 1 must not be allowed to go same way. Public already aware and concerned over problem and enough dope stories have appeared in press to make current uncertainty and speculation a decidedly negative factor in political as well as economic field. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is being accused more and more of “going way of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>” in sense of promises without performance.</item>

                            <item>As reported in previous messages we consider <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> has approached problems in soberer mood in recent weeks. Other foreign observers have indicated to us similar impressions. His approach to aid matters now parallels our own and he has given up his exaggerated public promises. These changes in him seem to have coincided roughly with resignation of Tavares from triumvirate and <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs own belated awareness in late June of full dimensions local fiscal crisis. While I would not be so foolhardy as to predict a steady course ahead by <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>, he is at present in sounder and more serious mood than any time since my arrival here in March.</item>

                            <item>There seems to be a sensing of this among some local forces as well; or perhaps they are primarily motivated by concern over what would happen if <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> went. At any rate within recent days there has been a certain coalescing around <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> of some influential elements of what might be called the local “establishment.” For the first time in my stay here Bonnelly has begun appearing at social functions and talking at length with <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> publicly. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>, until recently a strong advocate of early elections, now argues that all “sound people” must rally behind <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>, provided he takes action on economic front. Amiama is described as holding similar views. These are at least heartening signs of some influential support for austerity program, and the two leading newspapers have been demanding it for some time.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>In view of Aug 1 IMF deadline, time is of the essence. We need decisions, favorable I hope, on two proposals above in 4A. and B. within weekʼs time in order allow announcement stabilization program and aid loan as standby becomes effective. I realize this amounts to recommendation for strong U.S. support of weak de facto govt which has not always acted responsibly and will probably not always do so in future. We are, however, confronted with Hobsonʼs choice, and weak fabric of this country is burdened, as I have pointed out earlier, not with <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0064"/>economic problems alone nor with political problems alone but with both simultaneously. If military should decide to turn on <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>—and there are some renewed rumblings—we know of no Castello Branco on local scene. It is the Trujillista elements of military who want <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> back and it should be remembered that latterʼs demagogic economic policies while in office contributed considerably to current state of affairs.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>I deplore as much as anyone that in recent years we seem to get involved recurrently in this country with “rescue” operations. It is regrettably, after 33 years of Trujillo, that kind of country, but at least it still offers hope of rescue. This combined program may or may not work. If it does work it will not dispose of all our problems, notably political ones, but we have got to get through the present in order to be able to work on the future. If we do not confront the situation vigorously, there will be increasing possibility of some form of blow-up here in not too distant future. We all know who would have to pick up the pieces in such event. We had better batten the hatches, for the hurricane season is approaching.</item>

The Embassy should also announce that the two governments were reviewing various short–and long-term projects to further improve the economic and social development of the Dominican Republic. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, FN 1–1 DOM REP)</note> It has been designed to overcome problems we see in minor aspects of the proposal you have made. I want to discuss these problems in this message.</p>
                        <p>We feel that any statement made should originate with the Embassy. It could be released here simultaneously as an Embassy statement. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs desire to have the President associated with his effort is understandable but we are not prepared to recommend that the President commit himself. <gloss target="#t_GODR1">GODR</gloss> has not yet demonstrated through performance that we would be justified in tying ourselves to a figure.</p>
                        <p>We cannot at this time justify approval of a $25 million program loan to the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss>. Even though disbursements under such a loan would be tied to sound performance as you suggest, it has been our experience that once an announcement of this kind is made, it is all but impossible to stick with the terms as time passes. Unexpected elements enter the picture and pressures mount for release of funds “committed” to cope with “unanticipated crisis situations”. Additional major element of uncertainty is impact of stand-by implementation on future balance of payments deficit. Knowledge that funds are available for disbursement very often weakens the resolve of prospective recipients to implement the measures to which they have committed themselves. These and other reservations seem particularly pertinent in the Dominican context. It is therefore our feeling that it would be prudent to avoid associating a dollar figure with a statement of our conditional, future intentions. When the Dominicans have pressed us here for an overall dollar figure, we have responded that there are no specific limitations on future <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance. We are prepared to look with sympathy and serious intent at any proposal which contributes to the attainment by the Dominican people of the goals of the Alliance for Progress and which will not be counterproductive to the Dominican austerity program. A similar response could be used by the Embassy when this question is raised by <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> and others, including the press.</p>
                        <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0066"/>
                        <p>As our proposed statement reflects, we hope shortly to add $4 million in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds to the Treasuryʼs $6.25 million for immediate use of the <gloss target="#t_GODR1">GODR</gloss> in dealing with its balance of payments problem. Although no counterpart pesos for the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program will be generated by the $6.25 million from Treasury, the $4 million in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds will generate pesos which can be so applied, while future projects are developed and processed.</p>
                        <p>We believe this method of approaching the overall problem has several distinct advantages. (1) We are substantially forthcoming now for impact purposes. (2) Our future intentions are stated in specific terms but without tying us to a fixed dollar figure. (3) We maintain maximum leverage for the future in dealing with an individual and a government not notably resolute or effective.</p>
                        <p>I believe this response to your recommendations represents the most workable and realistic course of action under the circumstances and hope that it meets with your approval. Please let me know.<note n="4" xml:id="d10fn4">The Embassyʼs response has not been found.</note>

<list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>U.S. has given strong support to <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> since Trujilloʼs death and cooperated closely with govts of both <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> in interests DOM people. We made our opposition to Sept. coup crystal clear, and offered hospitality to leading members of deposed regime.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>We continue hope for earliest possible return to constitutional and representative government. Interim <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> Govt. knows this and when conditions are propitious we will exert our influence in every way possible to encourage such a return. However, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> as realistic men surely recognize that prerequisite conditions for meaningful elections or return to constitutional regime do not presently exist. As patriotic men they wish to see country once again enjoy a democratic order. First order of business in creating necessary climate is overcoming financial crisis. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, along with U.S., therefore have real stake in success of stabilization program.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>Fall of <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> regime at this time could benefit no one except perhaps small clique of power-hungry trujillistas and reactionary military. DOM people would be the victims of this step backward. Neither <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> can hope for advantage from political overturn under these conditions. (In using this line we assume latter is sincere in professed refusal consider coming to power except through democratic methods.)</item>
                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>U.S. has committed resources and prestige to stabilization program, not to further interests of any politician or political group, but because program is necessary to future well-being of DOM people. We are therefore particularly concerned by activities on U.S. soil which endanger program and which many undoubtedly believe we sanction, but which abuse our hospitality. In making this point we refer specifically to activities on U.S. soil. Publications and broadcasts within <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> are internal matter. We are gratified to note that freedom of expression continues exist to large extent in <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> and have assurances from <gloss target="#t_GODR1">GODR</gloss> that it will not interfere with publication of opposition views which do not violate DOM libel laws or are not patently seditious. (FYI—<persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> has given us such assurances. He has also stated that playing of taped broadcasts made abroad by <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> will be permitted in <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> if two men observe libel laws, refrain from open calls to sedition and cease using foreign media and radio stations for agitation. You may wish check this point with <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>.)</item>

                        <p>These are general points only. Approach will vary somewhat considering differing interests and personalities of two men and according to how conversations go but intent will be to make clear to each individual that speeches and broadcasts they have made in U.S. involve the U.S. in internal Dominican politics, which we cannot condone.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing method of dealing with problem through <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> themselves appears most feasible in view complexities involved in attempting to approach stations involved and in view constitutional guaranty of freedom of speech.</p>

                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>Following an exchange of pleasantries, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> said that he particularly wanted to talk about what he regards as the grave general situation in the Dominican Republic. In his view, the <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> regime <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0069"/>completely lacks popular support. As a consequence, there is a continuing state of unrest in the country. The people are uncertain of the future and suspicious of <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs intentions. On one point a real national consensus exists: the government must announce elections. Elections represent the only solution to the problem.</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> if he were suggesting that elections should be held immediately. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> said he realized this would be impossible but saw no reason why they should not be scheduled in three or four months. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> then went over much the same ground as previously with regard to the absolute necessity for an electionsʼ announcement. However, he ended this time by offering the opinion that perhaps eight months to a year would be a good time frame. Finally, in the face of no response from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName>, and after several additional assertions that the announcement of a firm date is the most important thing, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> settled on December, 1965 as possibly the most appropriate time for elections. The elected government would take office in February, 1966, thus giving the <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> regime some 18 months to work on the nationʼs problems.</p>

                                <p>On several occasions <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> sought to elicit an indication that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be prepared to intervene in the problem of elections. He suggested that we would be in the best position to bring pressure on the <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> regime to announce elections. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> painstakingly explained our position, going over it twice in Spanish and once in English so that there could be no misunderstanding: (1) The United States hopes for a return to representative government as soon as feasible and the present Dominican government is fully aware of this position. (2) We cannot, however, become involved in the strictly internal problem of how this return is to be accomplished. The Dominicans themselves must work out the details. (3) Once a reasonable plan has been evolved with the support of the majority of responsible elements in the Dominican Republic we are certain that public opinion here and throughout the hemisphere will strongly approve.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> indicated that he understood this position. He would, under the circumstances, not wait for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> but would himself take the initiative. It was at this point that he brought up the plan (described in <gloss target="#t_D1">Deptel</gloss> 146) to call a meeting in the United States.</p>

                            <item>With regard to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> used the word “obstinate” (terco) on two occasions. He also referred to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> as a “romantic.” In his view, there is no possibility that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would agree to a formula for elections, even if all the other parties were to fall in line. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> inflexibility holds the position that only a return to constitutionality in the form of reinstating the 1963 Congress can be accepted. In all honesty, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> remarked, the position does coincide with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs own personal political interests inasmuch as he could scarcely participate <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0070"/>in elections. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> added, however, that representative leaders of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> can be prevailed upon to join in an agreement on elections.</item>

                            <item>Asked what other parties he would expect to be represented in the proposed meeting of political leaders, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> mentioned Luis Amiamaʼs PLE, Read Vittiniʼs <gloss target="#t_PCD1">PCD</gloss>, Ramón Castilloʼs PPDC and other undesignated “legitimate” parties. He dismissed Juan Isidro Jimenes Grullón [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] and asserted that there would be no reason for <gloss target="#t_UCN1">UCN</gloss> participation inasmuch as whoever came on <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs behalf would also automatically represent that party. In his opinion, the government and the <gloss target="#t_UCN1">UCN</gloss> are one and the same. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> remarked that all the parties he had mentioned (including the <gloss target="#t_UCN1">UCN</gloss> but apparently not the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>) are minuscule and of no real importance as political entities. He had a kind word for Read Vittini as a young man of some substance. Castillo, however, is another [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>].</item>

                            <item>As for his own plans, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> said that he would return and participate in the campaign once there is agreement on an electoral formula. He spoke, in the manner usually employed on these occasions, of his duty to his supporters. Subsequently, however, he commented that as a political figure he must think primarily of his own political interests. Thus, his public pronouncements should not always be taken at face value, bearing in mind the necessity for preserving a political position.</item>

                                    <item>Rumors that San Cristobal group interprets current strike as excuse overthrow triumvirate and install military junta being generally discussed in all military circles as well as by people on the street. Carbuccia, Air Force Chief, states group nothing more than debating society and should mind its own business; Wessin of training center states he would like San Cristobal group make move as excuse to eliminate them once and for all; Rivera of Navy states he will move two destroyers into position to bombard army camp if they get out of hand; Peguero, Police Chief, disdains the probability coup effort. Point is, rumors, whether or not based on fact, have caused split in armed forces unity—a very effective Communist or oppositionist maneuver.</item>

                                    <item>Attachés maintain belief that rumors are just that, and there is no group within army, or military, planning or plotting overthrow of government. San Cristobal group openly discussing requirement for <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> announce schedule of elections on ground that such action would ease political pressure now on triumvirate. Group strongly Balaguerista and are convinced when elections held <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> can win. Unquestionably other factions within armed forces, other than San Cristobal group, are restless and discontented, principally amongst junior officers of all services. Discontent stems from unfair promotion policies, disgust with graft and incompetence of senior officers, and pressures exerted by politicians. Attachés do not, however, find any cohesion among factions, nor any single group, including San Cristobal group, having sufficient strength undertake golpe on its own.</item>

For moment attachés see no sign change of military attitude towards <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> and believe they will follow him through current crisis. San Cristobal group views towards elections, however, may catch on. With the remainder of the military and coupled with the already existing pressures for elections from the politicians, become a serious issue that <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> will have to face and resolve.</item>

                            <item>I welcome idea of approach to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> but believe we would be on sounder ground in talking with them if we avoided taking as open a position on elections as suggested in para 2 reftel. Other points re importance stabilization program and disinterested nature our help could well be made.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>For one thing I believe it is asking too much to expect them, especially <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, to agree that conditions for elections or “return to constitutionality” do not exist. Both men, along with certain other politicians, have been insisting that political “solution” is sine qua non for any successful economic stabilization program, that financial crisis is essentially fault of present regime, and that changing government is first order of business. Although he seems unlikely to return under present conditions, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> was after all the elected President and is not likely accept argument of this type which he would regard as action our part to protect regime which overthrew him. To the extent that underprivileged Dominicans have active political interests now, he may still be the most popular figure.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>As for <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, he probably believes conditions are ripening for him. He may be right. Embassy continues believe him a divisive force here due past association with Trujillo and his record of submissiveness to military and of economic demagogy (his policies contributed <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0073"/>greatly to present fiscal problems); but we must bear in mind that, like him or not, we may have him to deal with again one day. His appeal is considerably broader than merely to Trujillistas, and extends into agricultural, business, labor, and military elements. Presumed intent of reactionary military group, if it were able carry out coup so much discussed here during recent days, would be to take over govt and then piously proclaim early elections in confidence <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would win. Against this background it does not seem likely to me <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would agree with alacrity to suggestion on our part that he postpone indefinitely what he must regard as good prospects.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Given attachment of DOM Rep, along with other countries of this Hemisphere to ideal of elections and constitutional govt, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should in my opinion avoid bad posture of being on public record as opposed to elections. Conversations in that vein with countryʼs two leading public figures, each with his own interests to further, would be public knowledge in short order. On other side of coin I find it equally disadvantageous to make implied commitment to either of these two that at some point we will help them return to country to participate in elections. Our present formula that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of course favors return to constitutional govt in DOM Rep but consider Dominicans themselves must make decision re type and timing of elections, I believe, serves our interests about as well as any we might devise. It preserves our flexibility and does not tie us to any one individual or solution. It is in the nature of the environment of a country like this one that we cannot escape being charged by the outs as favoring the ins, going on record re postponing elections would confirm what is now only an allegation.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Nor do I believe we will meet with any great success in ensuring publication and broadcast rights within DOM Rep for the two Bʼs, as suggested in para 4 <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss>. I frankly do not think <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName>ʼs assurances in this regard are worth much—nor would any I might get from <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> be any more enforceable. Latter is thin-skinned and often tends regard legitimate difference of opinion with his proposals as base political machinations against him personally. He would see sedition much more quickly than we. In short, we could not deliver to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> with respect handling given within this country to their expressions of opinion, and I recommend we not get involved beyond stating our continued support of freedom of expression here.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>A further point on which we should be careful in my opinion is the extent of our commitment to <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>. We should avoid overcommitting <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to him. We should have no illusion that <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is now a popular political figure. He is not. A principal reason for his survival this past week was not so much positive support for him and his policies as fear on the part of responsible elements over what would take his place. While he has thus far shown considerable responsibility as regards <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0074"/>stabilization program, his administration of govt remains erratic and marked by actions which often alienate very elements who should and would like to support him. As reported before, there is instability in his make-up and he is strong-willed. Circumstances could lead him to take authoritarian turn if he considered he had carte blanche from us and full control over local military, many of whom think in such terms anyway (it is my opinion that, while he has thus far done adept job in balancing military, diverse ambitions this group make it an uncertain element and <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is perhaps inclined to overestimate his mastery of them). There could well be actions and decision with which we would not want to be identified. We are giving and should continue to give <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> support to extent he deserves it, but I believe we shall get better results through keeping him on fairly short rein and not tieing ourselves to him irrevocably.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Agitation for some action on political problem is rising again. While apathy and distrust of politicians may rule countryside, political, press, and other elements including some in military are beginning to heat up electoral issue. We can expect more of it as September 25 anniversary of coup approaches. We are already being reminded by some that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> recognition of triumvirate was based on promise of election schedule to begin this fall. Next crisis here may well revolve around the electoral issue. Agitation is not so much for actual elections as for the setting of a date for them. We may find it in our interest before much longer to add our voice to those who are urging that at least a date be set.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>For all these reasons I believe approach to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, which I heartily support, should be based on very legitimate grounds of their abuse of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> hospitality through their indulging in political activity from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> territory. It has long been accepted among Latin Americans that political exiles do not engage in home politics from their place of exile. Current agitation in Brazil over Goulartʼs activities in Uruguay is a case in point; and Mexico would not sit idly by if anti-govt broadcasts were beamed from Laredo or El Paso. However, rather than have approaches made by political level of Dept—with all that local rumor mill here would make of them—it would seem preferable to have matter raised by Justice Dept officials or Dept security officers and treated as straight violation of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> hospitality. If latter not considered feasible, then I would still favor restricted approach along above lines by political officers in order put some restraint on <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>It seems to me we have strong case here in making clear we cannot condone activities from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> soil which involve us in internal Dominican politics. To the extent that we take position with them as regards elections, then it appears to me we involve ourselves in precisely what we wish to avoid.</item>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> at his own initiative. He said he had come simply to “exchange views” on the current situation in the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was of the opinion that things have been going from bad to worse. Although the Triumvirate did announce elections, nothing is being done to create a climate in which elections can be held. The “majority parties” (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>) are prevented from using the radio or staging public manifestations. On the other hand, “extremist” groups such as the Social Christians and the 14th of June do have access to the radio and continue to agitate. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Antonio Imbert</persName> has been going about the country handing out arms for a “campaign of terror” against <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs supporters. A new black list of those who are prohibited from entering the country (including <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>) has been published. Some of the most dubious elements on the list are actually in the country at the moment—a strange state of affairs. There has been a wave of police brutality. Two persons apparently murdered by the police were recently left out in a public park.</p>
                        <p>Discrimination against the <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> has led <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to conclude that the political truce proposed by the Triumvirate is to be completely one sided. While the leftists, the “pocket parties” such as Vanguardia, and the <gloss target="#t_UCN1">UCN</gloss> continue doing business as usual, the responsible opposition is to be repressed. In essence, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> thought that these developments indicated an intention by <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> and his entourage to maintain themselves in power indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHW1">Shlaudeman</persName> remarked that we had not previously heard that the 14th of June enjoyed access to the radio. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> explained that he had meant indirect access through other groups which propagate the 14thʼs line. He mentioned the Social Christians in this regard.</p>
                        <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0076"/>
                        <p>With respect to <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> said we had the impression he was operating on his own account, not the governmentʼs, and that he was giving trouble to everyone concerned. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> also questioned the reports that <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> was handing out quantities of arms. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> insisted that <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and his cohorts had collected large stocks of arms during the time of the Council of State and quoted a communiqué issued by the 14th of June to the effect that <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> had offered weapons to the “revolutionary youth.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> reiterated our hope for a return to representative government through elections and our intention to leave the working out of the details to the Dominicans themselves. He commented that progress made now in solving the countryʼs economic and financial problems would, to a large extent, determine whether a proper climate will exist next summer for an electoral campaign. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> asked if Francisco “Pancho” Aguirre had any connection with the United States Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> assured him that no such connection existed.</p>

I do hope that you and your colleagues will continue to push for clarification of U.S. policy and short term objectives in the D.R.”</note> I thought I ought to do some more specific checking.</p>

He has also talked about going via Haiti. His reasoning on Haiti is hard to see, but it would create tension between the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> and Haiti and probably blowup any chance of an improvement in relations, which the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> is trying to work out. The end result would probably be to strengthen <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> even more.</item>

                        <p>I do not find anyone really confident about the Dominican situation. There are only a few Dominicans qualified to help run the government. When you are that thin, it does not take much to upset everything.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is working on a program which will probably cost $15 million in 1965. Its main thrust is in agriculture—the idea is to put more money in the farmerʼs pocket; cut imports of foodstuffs and save foreign exchange; and possibly improve exports and earn some foreign exchange.</p>
                        <p>The question of Communist strength is a mixed up one, and not as urgent as either of the two factors above. When the Government broke up the guerrilla movement and killed a number of its leaders, it dealt a severe blow to Communist strength. It also deported a number of activists—in fact got rid of two more last week. At the same time, some are coming back. The only explanation at the moment seems to be that they are from “good” families in the Dominican Republic and the Government has not resisted the pressure from these families. Nevertheless, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> raised the issue with the Dominican Government last week. His [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] has put together a list of those that have filtered back, and both the Ambassador and State plan to urge the Government to take necessary precautions.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p rend="center">FOREWORD</p>
                        <p>The following review of events in the Dominican Republic under the governing Triumvirate headed by Donald J. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid Cabral</persName> covers the period of the past eleven months and represents a joint effort on the part of the Political, Economic, Military, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, and USIS elements of the Mission.</p>
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> has clearly been the dominant member of the Triumvirate since his accession to it in the last days of 1963, the group was marked by dissensions and rivalries until the resignation of Manuel Tavares Espaillat at the end of June.<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">Manuel Tavares resigned on June 27 because of strong differences with his fellow Triumvirs over the political direction of the country.</note> From January through June the Government managed to hold things together in a highly fragile situation, but very little positive was accomplished. It is only during the past five months that <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> can be said to have had a free hand in policy. While Ramón Caceres Troncoso, the other member of the now truncated Triumvirate, has special competence in the field of fiscal policy and is generally helpful as a balance wheel, it is clearly Donald <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs administration.</p>
                        <p>It is undeniable that there has been forward motion in the country since June on urgent national problems. The formidable commercial arrears problem has been liquidated, and right on schedule. Commitments to the International Monetary Fund have been effectively met. An austerity program involving new tax measures and other belt-tightening activities has been put into effect to correct the fundamental imbalance in the countryʼs balance of payments situation. It is far from being a perfect program, but in the Dominican context it has required political courage and skill to do what has been done; and the operation goes forward. There have been gingerly but steady steps to <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0079"/>bring the undisciplined military and police establishments under better control and to reduce the graft and corruption so characteristic of influential elements of those forces. Along with these necessary but essentially negative measures there has been positive and increasing activity on the part of the Government in the field of economic development, particularly in the fields of agriculture and education. In the private field considerable initiative is being shown, notwithstanding widespread uncertainty over the future and a distressingly high level of unemployment.</p>
                        <p>Against the background of Dominican life, with so little sense of community obligation on the part of the more privileged group, with general lack of technical and organizational skills and with petty venality underlying the whole structure of society, any motion at all requires strong determination and considerable talent for maneuvering on the part of the head of government. Throughout its history the Dominican Republic has alternated between dictatorship and chaos. Ingrained habits persist today, with a group of political leaders who are with discouragingly few exceptions self-seeking in the extreme and who show little or no interest in offering a positive program to the country, but rather prefer the more exciting pastime of trying to organize revolutions or persuade the military to pull off yet another coup dʼetat. The Dominicansʼ tendency to dramatize their problems being what it is, it is often said that <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> almost alone among current Dominican political figures has learned anything from the political torment of the Trujillo period and these first three years of its aftermath.<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">The following handwritten notation appears in the left margin next to this sentence: “why does one follow the other?”</note> Certainly today, beset by trujillista elements and others on the right on one side, and by <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> followers and those of the more extreme left on the other, <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> emerges as the moderate in the local scene.</p>
                        <p>There is general acceptance of <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs personal honesty, however much criticism there is of corruption at other levels of the Government—a corruption unfortunately all too prevalent in the private sector as well. Of secure economic and social position himself, <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is deeply concerned over the problems of his country and is highly motivated to do something about them. He considers himself something of a latter-day Franklin D. Roosevelt in that he wants to improve the lot of underprivileged Dominicans against the disinterest and often the opposition of his own class. It must be said in that connection that, although democratic in his social outlook, he often tends toward paternalism in his approach to the poor and their problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is a legitimate child of his own society and bears the psychological scars of the Trujillo experience as do so many of his countrymen <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0080"/>. In that connection, few if any have a cleaner record than he as regards the Trujillo years.<note n="4" xml:id="d17fn4">The following handwritten notation appears in the left margin next to this sentence: “questionable.”</note> As is characteristic of Dominicans, he is erratic and impulsive; when things are going well his self-confidence sometimes indulges itself in a form of cockiness which irritates those whom it would be in his interest to cultivate. He is strong-willed and can be high-handed; at times he insists on his own way when compromise would improve the general atmosphere and thus further his own long-range objectives.</p>
                        <p>A man of formidable nervous energy, he drives himself day and night. Better personal organization would make his schedule slightly less strenuous and the course of governing more orderly. While he has gradually assembled around him in the Government a group of able and even dedicated young men, his popular base remains much too narrow. Although young and attractive himself, and one who shared personally the Trujillo oppression, he has not as yet built a bridge to youth in this young-manʼs country.<note n="5" xml:id="d17fn5">The following handwritten notation appears in the left margin next to this sentence: “true.”</note> While an individual of wide-ranging interests, he seems to find little appeal in intellectuals; and conversely he has not much appeal for them. A poor public speaker, he is more effective in small groups than at large public gatherings.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> can be criticized for poor personal organization, for concentrating too many details in his own hands, for acting in a spirit of improvisation rather than careful planning in meeting the needs of the country—and this is a country with such a variety of needs that everything needs to be done at the same time—and for being over-cautious in cleansing the military structure. He is indeed criticized for all these things, and for other things as well.</p>
                        <p>Reidʼs faults and imperfections must, however, be judged against his own society and relative to the performance of others who have sat or aspire to sit in the same seat of responsibility. A judgment on this basis results clearly in his favor. However halting his steps with respect to some of the more unsavory aspects of Dominican life, he is the first post-Trujillo governor to take on, for instance, the all-important but highly delicate task of cutting back to size as primitive a military establishment as exists in this Hemisphere. If he seems to make haste slowly, it is, after all, his own slender neck he is risking in pitting his wit against the brute force of the Trujillo-trained men in uniform.<note n="6" xml:id="d17fn6">The following handwritten notation appears in the left margin next to this sentence: “good point.”</note> And he is doing it. In the financial field he has shown a readiness to face <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0081"/>up to the unpleasant and unpopular task of more taxes and more restrictions in order to restore fiscal balance to the country. This is a primary problem but it was ignored by the bulk of his predecessors and, in fact, heavily contributed to by some such as <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. His economic development program may suffer from lack of planning and coordination, but it is at least underway, and it is well oriented toward Alliance for Progress objectives. In sum, <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>, with faults and slippages which are partly his own and partly inherent in the Dominican scene, is now governing the country more effectively than it has been governed since Trujillo whipped it into order and lashed it into productiveness. Given Dominican history and realities, <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is governing with a minimum of violations to civil liberties. There is full freedom of the press.</p>
                        <p>Reidʼs courage is not in doubt and he has great determination. He is pro-American and pro-Western by strong conviction. He has shown the toughness of mind and the flexibility which are essential to govern in this country which so dislikes to be governed. There has been considerable growth in him in recent months. The governing group he has put together and their vigorous interest in attending to the countryʼs needs in agriculture, education and health are reminiscent of <persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">Figueres</persName> and his associates in Costa Rica<note n="7" xml:id="d17fn7">The following handwritten notation appears in the left margin next to this sentence: “interesting.”</note> (the writer was Costa Rican desk officer in 1948 and closely associated with the <persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">Figueres</persName> revolution). Hopefully, despite formidable economic problems ahead and an always dangerous political instability, the corner has been turned from the confusions and dangers of the immediate post-Trujillo period and the shock of the failure of the <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> experiment.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy study makes the point that <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs major handicap is his political illegitimacy. Had he won an election, he would probably be considered one of the more hopeful leaders in the Caribbean area today. How to make himself constitutional—how to obtain that moral base which looms so importantly in a Latin country, even one like the Dominican Republic which patently gives constitutionality more lip service than loyalty—that is the question. From his present course it seems clear that <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is attempting to play over the heads of the politicians and establish direct rapport with the people, especially the rural population, as a leader who gets things done for the little man.</p>
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> can hardly be said to have wide political popularity, recent events do tend to indicate a considerable acceptance of his administration, in part from general apathy and disillusionment with politics and in part due to the preoccupation of many that any change now would result in something worse. It is too early as yet to gauge the effect of <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs trips around the country to win popular support, <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0082"/>but the professional politicians are howling, and they can be counted on to try means both fair and foul to block him. The coming months should be interesting.</p>

                        <p>The arrival of a new American Ambassador in the D.R. in late March after a six-month vacancy<note n="8" xml:id="d17fn8">Full diplomatic relations between the United States and the Dominican Republic were suspended when President <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> was overthrown on September 25, 1963. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName> left Santo Domingo on September 28, 1963; he was replaced by <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">W. Tapley Bennett, Jr.</persName>, who arrived at post on March 23, 1964.</note> in the post came at a time when the Dominican political outlook was discouraging. The post-coup regime had produced no real progress and, indeed, even among those who had lavishly praised the coup doubts were sprouting. The Triumvirate itself was divided and ineffective. The country seemed politically apathetic, but violence was close to the surface and there was a noticeable political polarization in process. The world price of sugar was falling, and the economic profligacy of previous months and the errors of previous administrations were coming home to roost. Endemic ills such as the lack of national purpose and civic consciousness, over-dependence on the U.S., and the lack of durable institutions all contributed to a bad situation. On top of this, active subversive efforts were being made by several political groupings and the tide of balaguerismo was rising. At the peak of this pyramid of sand sat <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Donald Reid</persName>, a politically ambitious and at times erratic, but basically well-intentioned and determined man. His Government was de facto, had no broad base of popular support, was troubled with graft, and had had to resort to restrictions on public liberties.</p>
                        <p>A decision was required as to what the U.S. posture should be in this situation. That decision favored rebuilding rapidly the U.S. presence in the country, with a heavy emphasis on economic assistance which would get the country over its short-run hurdles while getting underway on long-range development.</p>
                        <p>By June <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> was clearly in the driverʼs seat, with adequate military support to give him some freedom of action. He “kept the lid on” politically—although not always in ways to our liking—and attacked economic and administrative problems vigorously. By the fall the problems were still formidable, but the regime for the first time was showing real signs of moving forward, and without simply turning to the United States for solutions to all problems. Although the <gloss target="#t_GODR1">GODR</gloss>ʼs own pace would necessarily regulate the pace and scope of our assistance, <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0083"/>there was continued reason to help this Government put its house in order and face the triple political, economic, and military threat facing it. A refreshing contrast to the bad leadership endemic in recent Dominican Government was being provided in several instances, most notably in the very important agricultural sector. The military and political problems, not the least of which were Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquín Balaguer</persName> and perhaps to a lesser extent Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>, would bring further and probably frequent crises, and the sugar problem seemed all but insolvable in the short run. At least, however, the country was moving ahead again, and in truth the alternatives to this Government did not seem good.</p>
                        <p>This regime has been subjected to a war of words perhaps even more intense than that experienced by its immediate predecessors, with public commentary ranging from charges that it is a dictatorship reminiscent of Trujillo to earnest claims that this is an essentially democratic, if necessarily firm, regime which for the first time in years is sincerely moving to get this country on its feet. This wide and vocal disparity has been reflected in the U.S. press as well. A balance sheet would include at least the following:</p>

                            <item>In the words of the Governmentʼs own “Information Bulletin” (August–October, 1964 issue): “Undoubtedly the Triumvirate is an unpopular Government. The majority of the Dominican people, without stopping to think of the reasons behind … measures, consider the Triumvirate a Government which has done absolutely nothing to gain popular support and sympathy. And this is the great truth. The Triumvirate acts in favor of the people, even if against the will of that people … There lies the difference between the present Government and others which preceded it.”<note n="9" xml:id="d17fn9">The following handwritten notation appears on the left margin next to this paragraph: “incredible.”</note>

                        <p>Truth and self-serving statements can be found in both lists. Many of the situations complained of are inherent in Dominican life and would be there under whatever Government. Many unpleasant realities in this country derive naturally from more than 30 years of a harsh dictatorship, and will be corrected only with time.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the range of choice for the U.S. has been limited. The alternatives to working with this regime have at no time since September 1963 been inviting. We have moved ahead with support, and <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0086"/>have tailored that support to the willingness of the regime itself to apply itself to the formidable tasks at hand. This approach has produced some forward motion and would seem to offer the best hope for the immediate future.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III. Prognosis</p>
                        <p>At the time this report was being written serious labor troubles, subversive political efforts, and coup rumors were again (one tends to lose track of the number of such sequences in the past few years) stirring up the country. Political peace here is a very relative thing; there is no way to avoid living from day to day.</p>
                        <p>The present regime, although it has made progress in important areas and deserves acknowledgment for doing so in the face of formidable odds, suffers from important faults. The most basic of these is its political illegitimacy. It operates from a much too narrow power base and depends, however necessarily in the realities of the Dominican experience, far too greatly on the military. It suffers from cronyism. And so on. It can be expected that its life will continue to be troubled. Although it is operating with reasonable effectiveness in the light of local circumstances, and seems stronger now than in the past, its strength could change in a matter of hours with the wavering of a few key persons (especially in the military).</p>
                        <p>We cannot be certain that, should <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> survive the coming months politically, he will in fact lead the country to the elections now scheduled for September 1965. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> himself may well not be entirely sure in his own mind what he plans for that—by Dominican political standards—far-off time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is, however, a reality—the reality with which we have to work or sacrifice to a change over which we would certainly not have full control and which well might (e.g., <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>) prove far less in the interests of either the Dominicans or ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Hopefully by moving cautiously ahead with <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>, making our actions at each step of the way dependent on continued indications of his own willingness to move the country toward sound economic development and a feasible return to representative government, our efforts will bear fruit. Perhaps there is greater reason to be optimistic over the basic situation now than at some times in the past, for Dominicans themselves are at last showing some signs of understanding that they must gird themselves for a long pull. They are perhaps beginning to realize that the fruits of progress and democracy are not there for effortlessly plucking off the tree of liberty which for so many years was watered with their blood but kept beyond their reach.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Tom:</p>
                        <p>I hope Washington does not underestimate the military changes which occurred here last week.<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">On January 27 <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> removed a number of key military officers, including Air Force Chief of Staff Miguel Atila Luna Perez, Navy Chief Julio Rib Santamaria, Army Chief Salvador Augusto Montas Guerrero, and Police Chief Belisario Peguero Guerrero. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> himself took over the Minister of Defense. In telegram 766 from Santo Domingo, January 29, <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> reported that these military changes “constituted major step forward in continuing struggle to eliminate or neutralize Trujillo-minded elements in Armed Forces, reduce military contraband and graft, and stabilize military base of support for government which will enable it to get better on with its business, particularly crucial economic program.” (Ibid., Central Files 1964–66, POL 15 DOM REP)</note> It is not exaggerating to say that <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid Cabral</persName> made the shifts at the risk of his very life—in several cases he was dealing with gunmen of the Trujillo era. I myself consider last weekʼs events the most significant step here in cleansing the structure and putting Dominican society on a more rational basis since the departure of the Trujillo family in late 1961.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the politicians and the newspapers which are against <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> have been loath to give him credit. Many of the same people who ten days ago were accusing <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> of being under the domination of the military and in league with the corruption so prevalent in the Police leadership and certain quarters of the Armed Forces now view with pious alarm their sudden finding that the military is now dominated by Reid. They were clamoring for civilian authority to assert itself, but now, seeing that the move has redounded to <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs personal prestige, they see incipient dictatorship.</p>
                        <p>The fact is that the list of names of those retired, reassigned, or shelved reads like an Ian Fleming rogueʼs gallery, and those involved would have long since figured in a police lineup in a more well-ordered country. There are quite naturally smoldering resentments among some of these saurian elements and the situation, as the cables to and fro indicate, is still not without some danger. However, as of now the changes, which were of such a scope as to affect all four services and the police, seem to be being absorbed. Our military people are <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0088"/>for instance very much heartened over reforms already being instituted by the new Chief of the Air Force. They are right in line with what we have been urging for some time. The Minister of Finance has told us that they have already been able to find economies in the military budget which will save $100,000 a month, and that their goal is to get this up to $300,000 a month. That is significant saving in these latitudes, and we shall do our best to see that they are carried through. At the same time, I am counseling that they not move so fast as to provoke a counter-reaction that could not be controlled.</p>
                        <p>In connection with local events, you will recall our conversation in Washington about <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">Not further identified.</note> It seems to me that the time has clearly come to move on him. In line with <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy Crockett</persName>ʼs request, we are sending forward in this same pouch some examples of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> public speeches in Puerto Rico and his more flamboyant statements which are regularly published here. I have no doubt whatever that he is grossly abusing his status as a political asylee on our shores. The pace and tone of his activities has stepped up markedly in recent weeks, and his latest activities (reported in our telegram 781)<note n="4" xml:id="d18fn4">Dated February 2. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 12 DOM REP)</note> of attempting to rouse the Dominican military against <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> seems to me to go far beyond the limits of acceptable activity. After all, this is a Government with which we have normal, even close, relations and whose Chief of State has on numerous occasions complained of the <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> activities.</p>
                        <p>As I wrote to <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy Crockett</persName> not long ago,<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn5">Not further identified.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> followers are continually going back and forth from here to see him—only an hourʼs flight each way—and he is constantly sending instructions and exhortations, both public and private, to his followers here. One of his principal lieutenants told our political section recently that the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> was resolved on violence and disorder for the spring months. We know that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> sent word to the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> in December to go all out in the strike attempted at that time. Of late he has become more and more bold in his activities, and this week two <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>–sympathizing radio stations joined in the effort to rouse up the military, on direct orders from <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> I am told.</p>
                        <p>At the very least, I do not see why he should be allowed to make public speeches in Puerto Rico attacking this Government with which we have friendly relations and with which we are working at forced pace to try to keep a very critical economic situation in balance. The <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Chase</persName> Manhattan manager in Puerto Rico, a top-flight man who used to be in charge here, spoke to me three days ago in perplexity over the <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0089"/>free hand we give <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> to make trouble and to try to tear down something we are attempting to build. We have required other Dominican political leaders who go to and from the United States to register as foreign agents on the basis of activities on their part which are minuscule as compared with those of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>. I do not know that this would actually be much of a sanction for him, although the general feeling seems to be that he does not wish to register.</p>
                        <p>My own feeling is that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is basically anti-American. This feeling is shared by members of the Embassy who were here during the <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> period as President and by some of my Latin American diplomatic colleagues in whose views I have confidence. The pact he has just signed with the violently anti-American Social Christian leadership, reported in <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 781, certainly gives grounds for questioning <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs personal orientation. One can speculate that he may have done this so that the Social Christians can jab and kick at Uncle Sam here in the Dominican Republic day in and day out while <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> sits in his privileged sanctuary in Puerto Rico at no damage to his American reputation while hopefully profiting from his friendsʼ campaign of defamation against us.</p>
                        <p>I hope that you, after looking over the material, will agree that action needs to be taken with respect to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>. While I realize there are some domestic difficulties for us in dealing with him and it is perhaps not feasible to move him out of Puerto Rico, I hope something can be done to put a halt to his political activities on our soil. If he wants to go away to Venezuela or farther, that would be all right with me. That would at least put an end to his calculated program at present of implying that the Embassy at Santo Domingo may be “supporting” <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Donald Reid Cabral</persName>, but that the American Governmentʼs real heart lies with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>. Many Dominicans will continue to buy that assumption as long as he is permitted to operate unchecked from such a close vantage point and, by so doing, suggest subtly that he enjoys American official support.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Tap:</p>
                        <p>We, too, have been impressed with <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs resolute and deft handling of his military people. As you point up in your letter of February 2,<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2">
                                <ref target="#d18">Document 18</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> is gaining experience and growing in the job. It is unfortunate that so many of the more articulate people in the Dominican Republic are disappointed he is making a success at it. This will not inhibit us in working with him so long as he continues to do the right things for his country and his people.</p>
                        <p>The problem of what to do about <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> is a difficult one. I do not think we can come up with a final answer at this time. <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> has briefed me on <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs recent activities and we have examined options open to us for dealing with him. Unfortunately, there is very little room within which to maneuver.</p>
                        <p>From a legal standpoint, we have no evidence that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has violated or conspired to violate any U.S. laws. What he has done is exercise the right of free speech. I can understand why the Dominicans find reason to complain about the way heʼs done it, but there isnʼt any law against it. Nor is there legal basis, or basis in precedent which would support a finding that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs activities have constituted an abuse of his status as a political asylee in the U.S. Iʼm afraid this would be true even if <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> had made statements which could be identified clearly as incitation of Dominicans within the Dominican Republic to rebel against the Dominican government. Although we can agree that this is what he hopes to accomplish, after going over the statements we can attribute to him, we would also have to agree that he has carefully phrased what he has said to avoid anything approaching outright or clear-cut incitation to rebellion.</p>
                        <p>This leaves us with only one way to clamp down on <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. We could make a finding that his activities are prejudicial to the public interest within the meaning of Section 212(a)(27) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.<note n="3" xml:id="d19fn3">
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 414, June 27, 1952. (66 Stat. 184)</note> But given the background and circumstances which <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0091"/>have led to his being out of a job and in the United States, we could expect a hue and cry from liberals in the United States and Latin America at large if we decided to make such a finding. This certainty would have to be weighed against the damage which <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs continued presence in Puerto Rico is likely to cause our interests in the Dominican Republic. There are other considerations to be taken into account as well.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is an unpredictable man, but we do know heʼs a political gambler, sometimes a reckless one. He plays what we might call a forcing game, as the series of crises he deliberately provoked during 1962 and 1963 demonstrate. It would be in character for him, then, to force us into a showdown.</p>
                        <p>Also, as you know, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> likes the underdog role. For years he has looked for ways to appear as the persecuted champion of democracy—just he and the people against the powerful forces of reaction. This is his style and it won the 1962 elections for him. He has also been effective in the pose of defender of national honor, dignity and independence.</p>
                        <p>We think the foregoing suggests that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would seek to extract maximum advantage out of what he would picture as U.S. persecution on behalf of an illegal and unpopular government. His only chance to regain power probably lies in some kind of upheaval within the Dominican Republic. Under the circumstances, why should he hold back? At this point <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> needs an issue. The best new tack available to him might well be to tag the Triumvirate with the U.S.–lackey label—another colonialist regime sold out to big brother. This could be particularly effective at a time of acute economic difficulties and it is not entirely improbable that he has had just this possibility in the back of his mind during recent weeks.</p>
                        <p>The possible effect on <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs own political position is also worth our attention. We gather there is at least an outside possibility that some of his following might, under favorable circumstances, be attracted to a more moderate and responsible candidate in the September elections. The question then arises whether a new martyrʼs role for <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> might not work against this desirable development. We realize that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs removal from Puerto Rico would weaken his grip on day-to-day <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> affairs but that this would result in a similar weakening of his popular appeal and ability to influence basic party policy appears doubtful to us.</p>
                        <p>Finally, let me give you some of our thinking on the larger aspects of the problem. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs claim to an exalted position among the hemisphereʼs democratic leaders has obviously been seriously eroded by events and by his own actions. Similarly, he is no longer quite such an attractive figure to liberals in this country as he once was. Reid, for his <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0092"/>part, has had increasing success in conveying a responsible and progressive image to the U.S. press. These are gains which a move against <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> could jeopardize.</p>
                        <p>In making these observations, I donʼt wish to leave the impression that we do not give considerable weight to the Embassyʼs arguments. We do not feel we should close the matter either way at this time. Our inclination at the moment is to take no action but we will be pleased to have whatever further thoughts you may have on the subject. You can at least be certain that we will give the problem another hard look when <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> comes in for his next extension of stay in April.</p>

                        <p>CAP 65134. Following is State Department report on the situation in the Dominican Republic as of noon today:</p>
                        <p>The Embassy in Santo Domingo has reported that Donald Reid, respectively President and member of the triumvirate which has governed the country since September 1963, resigned this morning and turned power over to General Montas Guerrero, ex-Army Chief of Staff who has been serving as Minister of Interior. General Montas in turn, is forming a three-man military junta. No information is yet available on the identity of the officers who will make up the junta.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> and Caceres, who have been providing the country with responsible and reasonably effective government, resigned in order to prevent further bloodshed. Key units of the army revolted yesterday and, although the other services at first seemed loyal to the triumvirate, it became apparent this morning that the government could only survive at the cost of civil war. The rebellious units moved into Santo Domingo, the capital, some sporadic fighting occurred and the military units loyal to the regime began to waver. Crowds of antigovernment demonstrators were active and there were reliable reports that the rebellious troops were distributing arms to their civilian sympathizers. Under the circumstances, <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> had little choice but to resign.</p>
                        <p>The movement against the triumvirate was initiated yesterday by a mixed group of disgruntled military, students and political agitators. The leaders included at least two prominent members of ex-President <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>ʼs Dominican Revolutionary Party: Jose Francisco Pena, a skilled and eloquent agitator, and Miguel Soto, who directs the partyʼs affiliated labor federation. Both are identified with the partyʼs left wing and both have been suspected of ties to the extreme left. Available information indicates that individuals identified with the pro-Castro 14th of June political movement were also involved, along with representatives of extremist student groups. It does not appear, however, that either the official Communist Party or the Popular Dominican Movement, a party oriented toward the Chinese Communists, was directly involved.</p>
                        <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0095"/>
                        <p>The more radical supporters of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, who have long been agitating for the overthrow of the triumvirate, were joined by some middle-grade and junior officers, noncommissioned officers and enlisted men in the army. The motives prompting this military participation were mixed. There has been mounting evidence during the last year of growing dissatisfaction among younger officers over the armed forcesʼ command structure which seemed to perpetuate incompetent and venal officers in the positions of greatest authority. In addition, sentiment favoring ex-President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName> has been particularly prevalent in the army. Recent Press interviews by <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> in which he indicated his intention to prevent <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> from returning to the Dominican Republic to participate in the elections scheduled for next September undoubtedly increased military disaffection. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> supporters for the past eighteen months have actively been proselytizing young officers and enlisted men, urging them to help overthrow the triumvirate and restore “constitutional government.” These elements combined to create divisions within the armed forces and eventually to undermine the position of the top commanders who supported Reid.</p>
                        <p>With the government now in the hands of a military junta, the key problem is restoring at least a measure of unity within the armed forces. Continuing dissension would open the way for the extremist elements who have attached themselves to the anti-triumvirate movement and would bring the possibility of further bloodshed. If unity is restored, it seems probable that the junta will call early elections. The available evidence indicates that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName> would probably win such elections. He has a history of demagoguery and was closely associated with the Trujillo regime. However, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is firmly anti-Communist and enjoys the support of some of the countryʼs best people. We could cooperate with him, as we have in the past.</p>
                        <p>Failure to resolve the dissension among the military would cause a dangerous situation. However, it seems likely that the quarrels can be patched up on the basis of self-interest in preserving the armed forces as an institution.</p>

                        <p>President: What is the report on the Dominican Republic?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, it isnʼt good this morning. We were hoping last night that the Army would be able to get together but they are split. The Wessin group and the Air Force are in one camp; a large part of the Army that is in Santo Domingo, the capital itself, is supporting the rebel government and the loyalties of the troops outside the capital are still uncertain. They have not gone over to the rebels yet and presumably they will split too. The Wessin forces are separated from the center of town by a river which is commanded by the rebels—the bridge over the river—there is only one. The guns controlling the bridge are being strafed by the Air Force and Wessin has not yet tried to move across the bridge with his main troops. Looting is going on in the city and a lot of chaos. They have got about 1400 Marines on board these ships standing offshore. I just asked if we might alert Defense, we might have to airlift in case things got very bad, some people out of the southern part of the U.S. assuming the Marines could get control of.</p>
                        <p>President: Southern part of the U.S.?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, by air.</p>
                        <p>President: Repeat the statement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Weʼve alerted Defense against the possibility of having to airlift some additional people down in case the 1400 are needed and are not enough. I do not think that there is anything that we can do right now except wait it out. I do not know how it will go. They are not likely to do too much shooting—at least they never have in the past. Either the troops on one side or the other are likely to cave. We heard last night late that they were moving over to Wessinʼs side and it apparently stiffened during the night and early this morning.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, he was asked to come up on consultation by the Bureau<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">See <ref target="#d20fn2">footnote 2, Document 20</ref>.</note> which was worried about the deteriorating situation but they did not expect it to come so soon.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Last night about 9 oʼclock we got a statement from both sides. The Navy is absent in all this but both of the combatant sides would permit an orderly evacuation as far as they were able to do so. As far as they were concerned. They could not speak for the other side. And early this morning they have assembled some 400 or more Americans, mostly tourists in the Hotel Ambassador, and they are ready for evacuation. We did not want to try to get them out at night because of all the Communists running around at night. We thought it was too dangerous. Early this morning we hear reports that the Navy, which has gone back with the Wessin Air Force group, is threatening to deliver an ultimatum—not to start shooting but to deliver an ultimatum—somewhere between 7 and 9, our time, this morning to bombard the city in a very intensive way. They could get maybe as many as 30 planes in the air and if the Navy turned their guns on, it could be a pretty messy thing. So I have just talked to the Secretary—what I think we should do, if you agree, is to tell our Navy to come into the port of Haina, this is about 7 miles from the center of town—this is where the Embassy wants them to come in because they are not supposed to be shooting—get in touch immediately with the Dominican Navy and since land lines are out we cannot communicate this morning with the Air Force people or the Wessin people—and find out whether they can communicate over the Naval radio (Dominican Naval Radio) with <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0099"/>those bases and tell them what we are doing and that we insist on a cease fire until we can get these Americans out and if they canʼt get in touch any other way, to send them a helicopter if this is necessary, to the San Isidro Air Base. We already have the word of the Commander [<hi rend="italic">Colonel Elias Wessin y Wessin</hi>] and make sure that this cease fire and this ultimatum and bombardment doesnʼt start until we are through evacuating, then use this time to try to get a ‘junta’ set up of some kind which will stabilize the situation. Does that make sense?</p>
                        <p>President: Yes. Yes. Why would they want to be bombarding the city until we got our people out, they agreed itʼs all right to take them?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well I think they are desperate. The Navy and the Air Force and Wessinʼs force are cut off from the city and they cannot get in and they do not have the strength to get in. They cannot get across this bridge and this is about all they can do. They strafe and bomb. It looks like to me a measure of desperation, and designed I think to break down the morale of the rebels and regain control ultimately in the city. This is what the design would be. Must be a pretty bitter feeling between the two branches of the Armed Forces by this time.</p>
                        <p>President: This is awful, isnʼt it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Yes, it is awful.</p>
                        <p>President: How much did we know about all this, Tom?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, we knew that it is a graft-ridden place and this guy [Donald] <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> [Cabral] has done a very courageous job in firing unnecessary people trying to balance his budget and doing all these unpopular things like taking taxes from the rich; eliminating graft in the military forces, and that sort of thing. They had duty free entry privileges, and brought in scotch and selling it twice for what they paid for it. They just tried to establish a little order out of chaos down there. It pinches everyoneʼs toes who were used to all these unusual privileges. The price of sugar dropped and we knew they were going to have a drought; we knew that things were not going well, that is why Tap <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> was up here to tell us that we had about 2 or 3 weeks to try to do something about it.<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> left Santo Domingo on April 23 for consultations in Washington; see <ref target="#d20fn2">footnote 2, Document 20</ref>.</note> We have put in a good deal of money but money does not do everything we hope it will sometimes. They had 30 years of a very strong rule and they just do not know how to manage their own affairs now that they have the responsibility themselves. It is a complex thing.</p>
                        <p>President: Does it mean, do you think, that this is another <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> government?</p>
                        <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0100"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Not yet. No. It is hard to tell what comes out of one of these messes and who comes out on top, but we do not think that this fellow <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> understands the Communist danger. We do not think he is a Communist but what we are afraid of is that if he gets back in, he will have so many of them around him; and they are so much smarter than he is, that before you know it, theyʼd begin to take over.</p>
                        <p>President: What is it that they see in him, why do you have this <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is a kind of literary man. He writes books but he is the most impractical fellow in the world—sort of an idealist floating around on Cloud 9 type—he is a handsome man and a good orator and the people just do not have the maturity to distinguish between words and deeds. He makes a lot of promises to them and so forth. That is the way he got elected by being a good orator.</p>
                        <p>President: What should I say about him in this press conference?<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">Reference is to a news conference on April 27 at 4 p.m. in the East Room at the White House during which the President summarized the situation in the Dominican Republic.

                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: That the situation is fluid; that we are evacuating Americans. Thereʼs some kind of bakerʼs convention there; a lot of tourists there and we are getting them out. We are going to ask the Embassy if we should get the wives and families of our official people out and that we have been promised a cease-fire so that this can be accomplished and we are in touch with both sides hoping to do what we can to stop the bloodshed.</p>

                        <p>President: Now letʼs go back over what weʼre doing again.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: We will tell the Navy we have this OK from both sides to get in touch immediately with the Navy at the Port of Haina and make sure everything is safe and that they are expected and unless some trouble develops, to let us know immediately, otherwise go on in as fast as they can, and get in touch with the Embassy. We will tell the Embassy the same thing and establish communication as best they can with the Air Force and the Wessin Forces across the river either by land line or by naval/military radio or if necessary by helicopter and tell them that we are starting to evacuate and to hold off on any shooting.</p>
                        <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0101"/>
                        <p>President: Is it likely that we might start moving our people out and theyʼll start shooting?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: I think there is certain risk in this kind of situation that somebody will shoot. As long as you have all these Communists and everything else around, and there is a chance for misunderstanding, I think there is always a certain risk. That is why we did not want to do it in the middle of the night. Communications are very poor but certainly with these threats of bombardment.</p>
                        <p>President: Where do you get those reports threats? Who tells us that? Gossip?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: No, no. These are reports that the Embassy has whether they are listening to them over the radio or something, I just donʼt know, I suspect it is just a radio threat. They said theyʼre going to announce it between 7 and 9, and give them a little time to think about it and then presumably start. That would put them up around 10 or 11. But I think the sooner we get started this morning the better.</p>
                        <p>President: How long does it take to get our people out?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, this we donʼt know. The Port of Haina is about 7 miles. I presume the Embassy can get enough cars to get these 400 or more people down to Haina and then presumably theyʼll have to be lifted either on helicopter or on these boats which would take several hours. But once they get to Haina, theyʼre 7 miles away from the center of town.</p>
                        <p>President: I would get them out as quick as I could.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>1128. Joint State/Defense message. Molina Urena, appeared at Embassy shortly before 4 pm, accompanied by gaggle of some 15 or 20 whom he introduced as his principal political and military advisers. <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0104"/>(FonMin Lovaton reportedly had already taken refuge in foreign embassy and collapse some other leading military already reported.) Cols. Hernándo Ramirez and <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> were with him. Following security practice I have instituted, I required all weapons to be checked at entrance.</p>
                        <p>Molina Urena, nervous and dejected, was trying hard to carry himself as constitutional President and failing miserably. While all emoted democratic principles and some sought breathe fire, it was clear they realized forces arrayed against them were superior and they said they prepared negotiate settlement.</p>
                        <p>In a meeting lasting almost one hour, various members of group asserted their people still prepared resist, but they felt their action necessary in interest preventing further bloodshed. I made clear our emphatic view senseless shedding of blood must end, at same time reminding them that it was their action on Saturday<note n="2" xml:id="d26fn2">April 24.</note> which initiated this fratricide and called forth counter-reaction. I recalled to them <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had loyally supported <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> to end of his government and beyond and had made clear its emphatic disapproval of his overthrow. That had happened, however, more than eighteen months ago. Latest effort to restore <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> was obviously unsuccessful and at some point one had to start anew. I made clear to them we were talking in similar terms to both sides and, while meeting was going on, word was brought in that navy-air force bombardment had ceased. I suggested it was high time they approach other side for talks.</p>
                        <p>Both in full group and in private conversation with Molina and one or two civilian cohorts, I underlined and reiterated there was no question Communists had taken advantage of their legitimate movement, having been tolerated and even encouraged by <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>. I noted that in spite of fact <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> democratic party, they had in effect given Communists free rein, especially through military distribution of arms to civilians in large numbers, their tolerance of widespread looting, and physical mistreatment of innocent persons. I said there was much talk of democracy on their part, but this did not impress me as road to get there.</p>
                        <p>At one point I told Molina Urena, with whom I have always had good personal relations, I was sorry for him as regards the way all this had turned out, but that he could not deny serious Communist infiltration and influence in recent events. His answers and those his colleagues were specious and unconvincing, although I found little give in their position and no willingness admit such was case. I recounted incidents to him on local TV over weekend of Castro-type “barbudos” spouting pure Castroism. He said I was trying to talk details. I replied <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0105"/>to him I wanted to make clear my government considers this kind of detail of great importance.</p>
                        <p>During meeting message came re danger posed for American citizens in La Romana through action rebel forces in handing out arms to civilians. I called this to groupʼs attention as example of just what we were talking about. They indicated concern and offered use marine helicopter to go to La Romana and stop it. This has however, been worked out through Police Chief Despradel.</p>
                        <p>As regards their request that we dissuade Wessin from crossing bridge and get air force to call off bombing, I reminded them Embassy staff had been successful four times yesterday in getting air force to hold back and had thought early this morning truce had been worked out. They had, in fact, tried to take advantage of each situation. Then I came down strongly on disgraceful incident at Hotel Embajador where American lives were wantonly placed in peril this morning.<note n="3" xml:id="d26fn3">At about 7 a.m. on April 28 a shooting incident occurred in the evacuation area at the Hotel Ambassador when rebel patrols entered the grounds on a false rumor that one of their opponents, Rafel <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> Aybar, an anti-<persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> journalist, was among the evacuees. The patrol departed after firing several hundred shots. No evacuees were reported injured.</note> Was this an example of democracy in action?</p>
                        <p>During meeting, Martinez Francisco called back (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 1118)<note n="4" xml:id="d26fn4">In telegram 1118 from Santo Domingo April 27, 1820Z, <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> reported that he had just spoken to Captain Mario Pena Taveras, leading member of the revolt, and Martinez Francisco, Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> recounted that he had told them in part that the “<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> wants cease-fire to give opportunity to form government which can effectively govern country.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–9 DOM REP)</note> asking to speak to Molina and saying he was going to make strong effort with him to give up. They had long talk by phone, contents of which not discussed with us.</p>
                        <p>I declined courteously proposal made by Molina that I attend negotiations along with <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> of DipCorps and representative of church. I said I had no authority to participate, and that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> view was accord should be reached by Dominicans talking to Dominicans. I said we looked forward to early elections, hoped they would be entirely free, and that perhaps they could be supervised by <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> if Dominicans wanted it that way.</p>
                        <p>Meeting finally dragged to close with Molina leaving accompanied by small group, and several others, principally military, lingering as though they trying to avoid going out again into cruel world. There was some evidence navy-air force group ready to talk with them and I urged them to get together. We have not yet heard results.</p>

                        <p>1146. Joint State/Defense message. It is our combined judgment that communications equipment is most critical lack in current situation. Air force, navy, Wessin and Montas forces are at separate points and hours go by without direct contact.<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">The request for 50 portable radio communications sets came from General De Los Santos, Dominican Air Force Chief of Staff, who wanted them for use by military forces and police in mopping up operations. (Telegram 1136 from Santo Domingo, April 28) In this telegram <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> strongly recommended that the sets be made available from stocks in Puerto Rico and that they be flown to San Isidro that morning.

                        </p>
                        <p>Attachés feel this the critical point and could well mean difference in results of present confrontation. Superiority of combined forces does not necessarily avail if it is separate, as here, in distinct pockets, with inadequate communications between them, and with each ground element facing leftist forces with heavy psychological propaganda of “peopleʼs struggle for liberation.” Equally serious, in attachésʼ opinion, is effect on morale of air force and others if we seem to deny them this item of equipment which, after all, has civilian as well as military uses. They are not asking for offensive weapons, merely means to talk.</p>
                        <p>While I regret as much as anyone that, once again, we have to rely on military solution for political crisis engendered by confused democratic left, all valid elements of which now either in asylum or hiding, as much from extremists who have come to dominate rebel situation, as well as from opposing military forces. However, plain fact of situation is that while leftist propaganda naturally will try to fuzz situation as fight between military and people, issue here now is fight between Castro-type elements and those who oppose it. We should be clear as to situation.</p>
                        <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0107"/>
                        <p>I do not wish to be over-dramatic, but if we deny simple communications equipment and opposition to leftist takeover here loses for lack of heart or otherwise, we may very well be asking in near future for landing of Marines to protect U.S. citizens and possibly for other purposes. Which would Washington prefer?</p>

                        <p>1149. Joint State-Defense message. Col. Benoit, member of junta,<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">At noon on April 28, Radio San Isidro announced the formation of a military junta comprised of three Colonels representing three service branches: Colonel Pedro Bartolome Benoit of the air force; Colonel Enrique Apolinar Casado Saladin of the army, and Captain Manuel Olgo Santana Carrasco of the navy. The junta announced that its principal purpose was to prepare the nation for free and democratic elections.</note> just telephoned Embassy to ask that U.S. land 1200 Marines “to help restore peace to this country.” Benoit did not elaborate simple request and he was given no encouragement. I do not believe situation justifies such action at this time and agree with Navy Attaché that Marines should not be used in any event for street clearing operations. Preponderant military forces are on side of Joint Chiefs of Operations, although they are separated geographically and, I repeat, without adequate communications between them. Psychological advantage still rests with rebels. Logically the juntaʼs forces should bring situation under control, but situation not really very logical and severe test of nerves now in process. In view conditions described my talk with <persName corresp="#p_VJH1">Vaughn</persName> this <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0108"/>morning, Deptʼs 657<note n="3" xml:id="d28fn3">The morning of April 28 <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> telephoned <persName corresp="#p_VJH1">Vaughn</persName> at approximately 10 a.m. to convince him of the need for communication sets. <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> telephoned <persName corresp="#p_VJH1">Vaughn</persName> again at approximately 11:45 a.m. repeating his request for the walkie-talkies, which the Department deemed unnecessary at this time. In telegram 657 to Santo Domingo, April 28, the Department summarized its position and stated that it did not wish to intervene unless the outcome of the struggle in Santo Domingo was in doubt. The Department wrote that it appeared as though the anti-rebel forces were winning, and that it would be only a matter of time until they dominated the situation. (Office of the Historian, Research Project No. 939, “The Response of the Department of State to the Dominican Crisis of April-May 1965,” p. 16) Later the same day during a telephone conversation among <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, the President approved the transfer of the walkie-talkies and instructed <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> to inform <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">General Earle G.

Further, we learned Wessin has not advanced this morning beyond bridgehead this side Ozama River and, all in all, not making very aggressive showing. Junta army organization confused and Air Force carrying burden. In short, attachés at this stage consider outcome still in doubt.</p>
                        <p>Department may wish do some contingency planning in case situation should break apart and deteriorate rapidly to extent we should need Marines in a hurry to protect American citizens.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that he thought the consensus here is that we have got to go with the judgment of those on the spot. The military commanders would have to decide on the best place.</p>
                        <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0110"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> could telephone the Ambassador and make it the Ambassador Hotel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he thought we should make a statement saying we are there to evacuate the 2,000 Americans and any other nationals who want to leave. Second, call on both sides to send representatives to wherever we land—the Ambassador Hotel or wherever—to negotiate terms of a cease fire and agree on the way we restore law and order and a democratic government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> asked if we wanted to take on the role of peace maker. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said there is a possibility that the mere landing of Marines will serve to strengthen the will of the Wessin side. The first thing is to go in and say we are there to evacuate. The second thing is to let them come and negotiate.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we were not going to announce anything until they have landed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that was correct. The President said we did not want them waiting there to shoot at <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> when we landed, like they did to the Belgians in the Congo.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> asked who was holding the Hotel Ambassador now, and added that he assumed it was the friendlies.<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">The Constitutionalist forces.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said we could not be sure because the Ambassador is saying that the loyal troops cannot guarantee the route from the Hotel to Haina. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said in any event the recommendation was clear: we give the order and then we begin to draft the statements.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would tell the commanders to take off in the helicopters and he would tell the riders to get their statements prepared so when they do land we can say they are there to evacuate and to bring these citizens of ours out and then he would follow up with the riders. He would have the airplanes over the islands immediately—he would have the helicopters off and we would have people drafting their statements explaining we were there to evacuate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said one thing they wanted is a clear message to <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> asking him to get the request rephrased in these terms and not in terms of the communist threat.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he had not recognized the new Junta. He said there are political problems and we may want to call in both sides.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said if we could get the Junta to inform <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> that they cannot guarantee to protect the Americans.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we could say that help is on the way in response to his request to evacuate the Americans. We have been informed that the Junta can no longer do it.</p>
                        <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0111"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that what the President wanted was a clear statement that they could no longer protect the American lives. The President said that this has already been said but he would say help was needed to protect the lives of the Americans and not refer to the communist angle. The existing government says that it wants <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> know it can in no way be responsible for American lives, it has reached a point where these lives are in danger, and therefore help is urgently requested. He added that in the meantime they will be on their way.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that he thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> should consider giving an alternative to the Hotel Ambassador if, as a matter of fact, they cannot get in without serious losses. He said he thought the military commander should have some discretion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said that the military [illegible—and the?] military commander—and the Ambassador—should be in touch about that before they land. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> agreed but said that we do not tell them anything until we are there. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said except to coordinate with the friend-lies who are holding the area. Mr. Man said if we told them it would leak all over town. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that we would not tell them until they are actually coming in.</p>

                        <p>Critic 5. Joint State/Defense message.</p>
                        <p>Regret report situation deteriorating rapidly. San Isidro pilots who have been principal element in junta forces tired and discouraged. Army leadership disorganized although Montas just named Commander in Chief armed forces, in effort mobilize army effort. Police Chief Despradel informs his mopping up operations have met such violent resistance he can no longer continue and that his maximum capability now is defense of few key installations. Wessin still expresses confidence, but obviously weary and speaking of need for more men. <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0112"/>Rivera Caminero worried and discouraged. De Los Santos and Montas still full of fight.</p>
                        <p>Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> just returned from San Isidro where most above officers now gathered found general atmosphere dejected and emotional, with number of officers weeping. Belisario Peguero there also in hysterical mood urging “retreat.”</p>
                        <p>Benoit of junta sent formal request U.S. supply troops, told <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief that without help they would “have to quit.” In view this report and recent messages through [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], Country Team unanimously of opinion that, now that we have request from military junta for assistance,<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2">See <ref target="#d29">Document 29</ref>.</note> time has come to land the Marines.</p>
                        <p>American lives are in danger. We suggest, subject conditions at moment, Marines establish beach head in Hotel Embajador vicinity centering on polo field which can be used by helicopters for landing. We would also be glad have detachment take possession Embassy grounds. If Washington wishes, they can be landed for purpose protect evacuation American citizens. We have just been told by police chief, for instance, that he cannot provide protection route Haina Naval Base which has been used until now for evacuations.</p>
                        <p>I recommend immediate landing.</p>

                        <p>The President began the meeting at 7:30 p.m., EDT, calling on the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reviewed developments of the past several days in the Dominican Republic. He explained that the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> moved to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Donald Reid Cabral</persName>, successfully ousted him quickly. However, some elements of the Army were determined not to allow ex-President <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> to return to power. By Tuesday afternoon, a consolidation of the situation had apparently been accomplished and several of the military leaders declared a junta. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> recited the findings of a recent poll among the Dominican people regarding their preferences for President in a popular election.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> explained that it appeared, as of the previous day, that the armed forces and police would be able to establish order. However, during the afternoon, there had been a deterioration. A number of civilians in the city of Santo Domingo had been armed by Rebels, including some <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>-trained Communist supporters. Law and order had broken down as a result. Approximately 1,100 Americans were taken out of Santo Domingo on Tuesday<note n="2" xml:id="d35fn2">April 27.</note> and approximately 1,300 remained. <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0117"/>The Ambassador had been informed by the junta that American lives were in danger and that further protection was needed for them because the military and police could not guarantee protection.</p>
                        <p>The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency: Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> reported that there had been positive identification of three ringleaders of the Rebels as <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>-trained agents.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Defense: Because of the danger in the Dominican Republic situation, the President had instructed the Department of Defense to place troops in position to take the necessary measures for protection of the lives of American citizens. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> reviewed the deployment of units of the fleet, including the aircraft carrier U.S.S. <hi rend="italic">Boxer</hi>, with its complement of Marines and helicopters. He reported that approximately 2,000 Marines were in position to be ashore within a time span of one to ten hours. He reported also that two divisions of paratroopers were on alert at Ft. Bragg, N.C. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said that all forces had been put in position and placed on alert to meet contingencies in the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>The President: The President reported that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> had advised Washington that authorities in Santo Domingo were no longer able to provide protection for American lives.<note n="3" xml:id="d35fn3">See <ref target="#d32">Document 32</ref>.</note> The President reviewed the fact that we had repeatedly asked for a cease-fire by both sides. Since activities were continuing there, however, he had on the advice of the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense asked that helicopters and other essential supporting equipment be in position to act as necessary.</p>
                        <p>The President reported that it would shortly be announced—within the hour—that the United States has sent Marine units ashore to protect and escort American citizens to safety. This action, he explained, was being taken on the basis of unanimous decisions of our country team in the Dominican, the recommendation of the Ambassador, and on the recommendation of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The President reported that shortly several hundred of our military forces would be landing in Santo Domingo.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>: The Senator asked if there were any way in which the Organization of American States could help.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that there was concern within the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> both for the safety of the nationals of the member states present in the Dominican capital and for the implications of the developing situation in the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0118"/>
                        <p>The President: At this point, the President read to those present the messages received in Washington from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> on the scene in Santo Domingo, D.R.</p>
                        <p>Senator Dirksen: The Senator related a telephone call he had received the previous night from Miami, reporting that the Dominican Vice Consul there was advising persons that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> was making a concerted effort to take over the Dominican Republic. Senator Dirksen commented that without regard to the reliability of the information he had received, it was necessary to take into account the factor of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President: He observed that there was no alternative to the actions being taken by the United States in view of the unanimous recommendations received from all responsible officials in regard to the advisable course for this government to pursue.</p>
                        <p>Senator Dirksen: He observed that, speaking for himself, if this proliferates, it seems imperative that the United States go to the heart of the matter and lay it out at them. Speak our piece, he said, and demand respect for it. He expressed his hope that actions taken would be vigorous and adequate and said “I will stand up for you.”</p>
                        <p>Speaker McCormack: It seems obvious that this situation is not consistent with our national interest. He asked the question, Can we afford another <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> situation of this sort?</p>
                        <p>The President: He reviewed the various influences contributing to escalation of the situation in Santo Domingo and observed that we canʼt waste one moment in taking action. He asked the Congressional leadership if there was support or criticism for any of these actions.</p>
                        <p>Senator Smathers: He asked whether it was the plan to put the Marines in and take them out immediately—or allow them to remain there?</p>
                        <p>The President: We havenʼt crossed that bridge yet.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State: This is not a 24–hour operation.</p>
                        <p>Representative Arends: How many civilians are there?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State: 1,300 or, maybe 1,000<note n="4" xml:id="d35fn4">See Appendix material for corrected figures. [Footnote in the source text. According to the appendix 2,865 Americans were estimated to be in the Dominican Republic as of April 27; of these 1,115 were evacuated April 27–29.]</note>—all of whom do not want to leave.</p>
                        <p>The President: At this point, the President read to those present a preliminary draft of the statement he planned to deliver on television network broadcast shortly.<note n="5" xml:id="d35fn5">See <ref target="#d33">Document 33</ref>. For the final statement read by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at 8:40 p.m. from the Theater of the White House, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.

                        <p>Senator Mansfield: Suggested that mention be made of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Stevenson: Concurred in Senator Mansfieldʼs suggestion.</p>
                        <p>The President: The President agreed with the suggestion and directed that appropriate language be included. He again asked if there were comments, criticisms or objections to the statement or action. None were expressed.</p>
                        <p>Adjourn: The meeting adjourned at 7:57 p.m. Senator Mansfield, Ambassador Stevenson, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> and others reviewed the statement, making the changes directed by the President.<note n="6" xml:id="d35fn6">At 8:10 p.m. on April 28 President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> held a telephone conversation in which they discussed the draft statement on the Dominican Republic. During this conversation President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked about the sentence: “I assure the Dominican people that in this hour of trial the United States remains fully pledged to support peace and freedom in their country.” <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he “saw no trouble with this. The very fact that we have gone in there is going to do it. If we are going to be hanged, letʼs be hanged for a wolf instead of a lamb. We are for peace and freedom, why donʼt we say it.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, Papers of <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Thomas C.

                        <p>1155. Joint State/Defense message. In view of rapid deteriorating situation here I have just asked Boxer to provide helicopter evacuation of Americans assembling in Embajador Hotel, including company for security purposes in view of sniping going around Embassy building, I have also requested Pathfinder Platoon to land on Embassy grounds for protection of chancery. I hope this action will give some heart to <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0120"/>loyal forces. Breakdown of all government authority and possibility that remaining forces available to it may soon tire or become physically incapable of maintaining their present position, I recommend serious thought be given in Washington to armed intervention which would go beyond the mere protection of Americans and seek to establish order in this strife-ridden country. All indications point to the fact that if present efforts of forces loyal to the government fail, power will be assumed by groups clearly identified with the Communist Party. If the situation described above comes to pass, my own recommendation and that of country team is that we should intervene to prevent another Cuba from arising out of the ashes of this uncontrollable situation.</p>
                        <p>Pending this decision we recommend that additional military units be dispatched to this area since present forces available are considered inadequate to perform the mission I have suggested as our last resort.</p>

                        <p>At 8:31 p.m. on April 28, 1965, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Thomas Mann</persName> held a telephone conversation during which the President instructed <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> to divide up a list of all Latin American Ambassadors with <persName corresp="#p_VJH1">Vaughn</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SRM1">Sayre</persName> and call the ambassadors to explain the reasons for the U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic. The President told him to stress the fact that the United States repeatedly asked for a cease-fire. The President also instructed <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> to send a telegram to all U.S. Ambassadors asking them to reach the highest authority of their respective countries to explain the actions of the United States.

                        <p>The President said he had been talking with <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">Reference is to a April 28, 10:20 p.m., telephone call from <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName> to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, which lasted approximately 9 minutes. (Ibid., Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Thomas Mann</persName>, Tape F65.11, Side A, PNO 4)</note> According to him, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> was saying that our Embassy was directing the thing for the other side and that we were responsible for it and everything and that we had furnished them with equipment and he didnʼt know what else. The President said he did not tell him anything about what we had done. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> said that he wanted to go back but he would not go back until after elections, if we could get them to agree, cease fire, etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName> said he would be standing by to do anything we wanted him to. The President said he thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> should have this information.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he thought we would know tomorrow. He said it seems that we have two or three possibilities. He said that the consensus was that the presence of the Marines would calm everyone down. He added that this would have been true before the commies came but what we donʼt know is what difference the commies will make. He said if it all quiets down the anti-communist forces will get control and we can guide it. If, on the other hand, we have to fight or go in and clean up it is possible that we will be in trouble, in terms of international organizations. He said we had been giving thought to which one of the various routes we should take if we go get in trouble. He explained about the Rio Treaty<note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3">The Rio Treaty, or Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, signed at Rio de Janeiro, September 2, 1947. (4 Bevans 559)</note> and a confrontation between two countries vs the situation if someone else invokes it. He said we therefore had to balance off the advantage of taking the initiative against the advantage of winning the battle. He said we do not know if they will attack <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in the UN but they could. He said we are losing a little bit by not taking the initiative in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> because we could say that they had already “seized” but if we take the initiative we lose a lot of our freedom of action.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that as far as <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is concerned, he did not see that he would help <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> a bit. He said he is against us, he is criticizing us, saying we were supporting the other side which is not true. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> added that he thought <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> had been heated up ever since he was thrown out and he thought we would have to play it by ear. The President said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> should have time to think about it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he would like to think about it over night and then see what has happened in the morning.</p>
                        <p>The President asked how many they thought they would evacuate tonight. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he did not know whether they would be able to carry on in the dark. He said he assumed that since the number is up to 4,000 now it is going on during the dark and he would say they have evacuated 700 to a thousand. He said we were not sure.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that the real trouble would come when we are finished with the evacuation—when we have to find a reason to stay on and he thought we would probably have to say that there are 2,000 Americans in the country—outside of Santo Domingo, and begin to stall a bit some time tomorrow. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said we would have a lot of decisions to make tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> what he thought would happen between the two competing forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he did not know what had happened between noon yesterday and noon today because when he talked to the Ambassador last night around 10:30 or 11:00,<note n="4" xml:id="d38fn4">Not further identified.</note> the Ambassador thought it would be all over within five hours. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said the only thing he could figure was that the troops themselves must have become fed up with the shooting at Dominicans and just sort of refused to carry out orders—maybe there have even been mass defections.</p>
                        <p>The President said that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> claimed he had 17,000 troops in the Army that would back him up, and that would be ready to fight. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that the figures he had seen were closer to 7 or 8,000. He said AP had an item saying 10,000—and this was composed of all the rag-tags, scum, riff-raff and commies, everybody they could fool. He said he would not be surprised if he had 2,000 but he would be surprised if he had 10.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what the population was and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he would guess around 4 million.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he was a little worried. He said the Ambassador had asked that the Marines be landed and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> felt that perhaps the anti-communist troops were not as weak as the Ambassador thought. However, the Ambassador had said they were necessary and <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0123"/>we had no alternative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said it was one of those situations where you have to rely on the people in the field. He said it was not only the Ambassadorʼs recommendation—the Country Team recommended it and that includes the three military attachés, political section chief, economic section chief, agriculture, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> mentioned that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] were ahead of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on this all the way. They were sending in memos predicting doom if we did not send in the Marines. The President said he did not know that. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said it was true, even when things appeared to be going pretty good.</p>
                        <p>The President asked about the Ambassadorʼs background and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he was a Georgia boy, in the service twenty years, fine record, solid, level-headed, believes as the President believes.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> who did the talking on the back-grounder. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had led off but he supposed that he himself did most of the talking. He said there were no hard questions. It was the White House group. He said we would have had a hard time if some of the leftwing Latin correspondents had been there. He said it was easy and we made all the points. We told them we did not know all the details because the fighting was still going on and had been violent. We painted a picture of the thousand people being loaded on the boat and how the commies had come before this to the hotel, separated the men and women, sent the women back into the hotel and then lined the men up (we took a change on that because we were going by reports we had received and these people were now in Puerto Rico). Without mentioning the commie side we said that the insurgent movement was more anti-government than it was pro-anything.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> told the President that all of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs people went into asylum today—they thought it was all over. The President asked who kept the fire going and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he thought it was the commies. He said he thought they had been building up strong points in the poorer sections of town. He said however that we do not know because no one can circulate around without getting shot. He told the President that we had informed the press about the Embassy Residence being sprayed with machine-gun bullets. He added that we had not gone into detail about the notes we had been sending but that we had stressed the safety angle and stressed that this was an evacuation. We said we were not in there to help or hurt any particular group but were there to evacuate Americans and printed a pretty clear picture of what actually went on. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> told the President they had given them a good background.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had better not plan on going home tomorrow. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he did not think he should. He said tomorrow will be the day. The decisions that will be made tomorrow will be much more important than the ones he made today.</p>

                        <p>President: Whatʼs the news this morning?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>: Well, the news is about the same as it was last night. We have about 500 Marines ashore. The rebels have heavy weapons and are holed up and barricading themselves in the center of the city. And the police force are relatively ineffective against these people because they canʼt deal with these heavier weapons. They found a tank which was promptly knocked out by a bazooka. There was no report of any contact or any fighting by our Marines. Thatʼs in Santo Domingo.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is a situation report on Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p>President: Back to the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> thing. Do we have any evaluation of the relative strengths of what really happened yesterday that turned this around?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>: Yes, we do. We have identified 8 hard-core, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>-trained guerrillas that are—they came in, they pushed aside the <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> people and took command of the forces. The <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> people well, they might be slightly pink, but were not the kind of terrorists that the Castroites were. Now they took over the situation rapidly. They raided the police station, took their arms, took their uniforms, and are sort of in command of the city in spots. The regular army, their tank units and so forth just sat on their bitty box over there and havenʼt done a darned thing about moving in. I think heʼs afraid of the gasoline bombs and the bazookas in the hands of the rebels. The army officers are holed up inside the city in one or two places and seem to have lost their nerve against the hard-core and hard-nosed guerrillas. I think they lined up a bunch of people and shot them and this sort of terrorized the other folks. In my opinion this is a real struggle mounted by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>.</p>
                        <p>President: What do you think we ought to do about it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>: I think itʼs clear we have got to take more positive action to clean these people out. Otherwise itʼs liable to drag on and on, and eventually these other folks, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> types, will get the top hand and then weʼll have a mess on our hands. Then we will restore order and turn things back over to the Junta. We had a member of the junta who begged <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to do this.</p>
                        <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0125"/>
                        <p>President: That will put <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in pretty much trouble internationally with all the international organizations, <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and United Nations, wonʼt it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>: It could sir, and I notice the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> is meeting this morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">At a special session of the Council of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> convened at 10:30 a.m. to discuss the Dominican Republic crisis Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> explained that the landing of U.S. Marines was to protect U.S. citizens and to secure their evacuation. Ambassadors from Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, and Costa Rica expressed distress at the turn of events in the Dominican Republic and indicated their concern over U.S. unilateral action. The Council requested the convocation of a meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> for May 1 and called on the Apostolic Nuncio, <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> of the Diplomatic Corps in Santo Domingo, Monsignor Emmanuel Clarizio to help arrange a cease-fire.</note> But there is no question in my mind that this is the start of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs expansion.</p>
                        <p>President: How many <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> terrorists are there?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>: Well, we have positively identified 8 of them. And I sent a list over to the White House about 6 oʼclock. It should be in the situation room—who they are, what they are doing and what their training has been.<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">A list of the eight alleged “Cuban-trained Dominican extremists” was presented in a Central Intelligence Agency memorandum, OCI No. 1208/65, April 29. The memorandum states: “While there is no evidence that the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime is directly involved in the current insurrection, it is nevertheless clear that Cuban-trained Dominican extremists are taking part. It can be demonstrated that at least 45 extremists had returned to the Dominican Republic since last October after receiving training in Cuba and/or elsewhere in the Communist bloc. All or most of these people can be presumed to be active in the current fighting which has a number of aspects reminiscent of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs revolutionary tactics.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, NSC Histories, Dominican Crisis 1965, Chron 4/24–9/21, Background Documents)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>President: What has been our problem with intelligence down there? Have we known this thing was in this shape?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>: From my review of the material I think we have been pretty much on top of this. Forces are being pre-positioned and all that and ready to move in was part of the deal. I think there are some deficiencies in our ability to get a regular broadcast-sized radio aboard ship. We probably should have some aboard ship so we can reassure the population and all that sort of thing. The local radio station went off the air and the only thing they heard was from Puerto Rico. It looks to me like we ought to equip ourselves with regular household radio transmitters so the house radio could broadcast information directly to the people if we so wished.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: There is no real news. Itʼs perfectly clear that the rebels have dug in down in the city with in-town guerrilla techniques—bazookas and mortars. There is going to be a very tough fight unless they are starved out. We donʼt know very much about the tactical situation. Our own people are all right. <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> doesnʼt want more than the 400 he has got at the moment. We are backed up with good strong forces that are available at intervals of up to about 8 hours now for more battalions from outside the area. We have got another 1,000 men right offshore if we want them, and 2,000 more 8 hours away and another 2,000 at one day intervals from there on. We are not going to need that force unless Buzz <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> is very much surprised. But the political front is the one that is hotting up. There will be a meeting in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> this morning. Leoni has pitched in pretty hard with the clear implication that we are against dictatorships on both sides. If there is this kind of violence by Castro-types in the city, I think we can expect very good support in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> because it is just what about two thirds of those governments are afraid of. The <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> people have taken out after <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> pretty hard on the radio and the Soviets are beginning to do so, although they havenʼt yet zeroed in very hard.</p>
                        <p>We have a problem with a request for asylum from <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> and Caceres, who are two of the triumvirs who have been thrown out. We are trying to get them taken care of either by the Papal Nuncio or by some other Embassy so we wonʼt be in the particular position of protecting unpopular people but they would get stabbed in the back by the Commies if they were caught so we have a certain obligation there. We will simply be dependent upon information from there as the day goes forward. My guess is that we now have a sufficient force on the ground. We will have to wait and see if the Dominicans can handle it for themselves with this moral support. But weʼll have to keep a sharp eye to <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0127"/>be ready to take stronger action if it looks as if the Communists were beginning to win. Our own people of course have only perimeter defense and evacuation orders. They have taken 2 or 3 hundred people out as of last night. That still means, if my figures are right, 800 odd Americans who arenʼt ready to leave or who havenʼt asked to leave or who are not in an area where they can be removed. We have enclaves at the Embassy, Hotel Ambassador, polo field. The Task Force Commander is sending a senior officer ashore, probably has him there now, to be in touch both with the military authorities, the friendly ones and with the Embassy. Our situation in terms of our own position is strong, but the situation on the other side is simply indeterminate. That at least is the way it reads to me after talking to people around town this morning.</p>
                        <p>President: Do the rebels have much strength? I thought the General [Wessin y Wessin] had done pretty well with his tanks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: But one of his tanks got knocked out, and they arenʼt in a hurry to go through the town as I understand it now. I think that weʼre in a situation where the rebels are pretty well into pockets. But if the police lose their courage or if the rebels extend their holdings in the city, you could have yourself a very tough cleaning up operation. And it wouldnʼt be a happy decision to have to ask the Marines to do that, but I donʼt think it will come to that in the course of the day. Iʼll be surprised if it does.</p>
                        <p>President: We want to be very, very careful not to sit here and let them augment their forces. Where are these Castroites coming from? The inside?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: This is all inside as I understand it so far. And Iʼm quite sure I think we ought to make sure the Navy is watching. But I will be very surprised if the Cubans try anything in the way of an invasion. We certainly ought to watch for it because itʼs not a surprise we want to have get away on us.</p>
                        <p>President: I sure donʼt want to wake up a few hours later and say weʼre awaiting developments and find out <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs in charge. Now who are we depending on to avoid this? <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> and the Agency; we have a double check. Now the Agency was extremely slow in informing <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> yesterday and we climbed up and down their back. Itʼs not <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>ʼs fault but some of his technical people were protecting their goddamn codewords and it took one of their very important messages 5 hours to get here. <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>, fortunately, was not interrupted; it was very, very good work by Bromley Smith who was feeding that stuff into <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> yesterday afternoon that allowed <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to take those decisions so the troops were in before nightfall. It would have been damn hard to have put them in if we hadnʼt done it that fast. So we just made it yesterday and weʼve got all those wires who have been skinned and bruised during the night.</p>

                        <p>President: They tell me they have been expecting this and anticipating it and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has been telling <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> about it every day. Is that true?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: Iʼll have to do a check, but Iʼll have to say that there was nothing in it that gave me any sense of alarm.</p>
                        <p>President: Letʼs do that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: The first I knew of it was when <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> came up here.<note n="2" xml:id="d40fn2">See <ref target="#d23fn2">footnote 2, Document 23</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>President: Theyʼre already saying I told you so.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: You can count on it. Thereʼs always some bastard who wants to play that game. Iʼll have Bromley do a re-check on that.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is a short discussion about <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> and the Presidentʼs schedule later that day. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> tells the President that he is expected in New York for lunch but offers to stay in Washington if that is what the President prefers. <persName>Johnson</persName> decides that <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> should go to New York as planned.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: I really think weʼve got the contingencies taped here so that it is a matter of picking off the order. The only tough part is how to be sure which is the right order. But we canʼt be absolutely sure. Weʼll never be sure that they wouldnʼt have won without the United States. We only know that we could not take that chance. That will be the same shape of the decision from now on out.</p>
                        <p>President: I donʼt think we could have been wrong yesterday, I think we will be wrong when we donʼt do enough, or we go in and do too much. We havenʼt done anything now but evacuate. But if we become a party to the fact …</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: Our problem is to have our force operate as potential and not as operational. Thatʼs the exact shape of the problem. And, therefore, there ought to be plenty on the scene and visible so the moral effect will be decisive.</p>
                        <p>President: Why did he [<persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>] just want 400?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: I guess he feels thatʼs enough at the moment. I honestly havenʼt seen the detail of his report.<note n="3" xml:id="d40fn3">Not further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>President: It looks like to me that thatʼs the only weakness thing; I can well understand why he doesnʼt want them buzzing around. I would certainly raise the question if you are going to have any moral effect, if you are trying to dig out our own people, and if youʼre trying to locate them in the hinterland.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: … if you want it perfectly clear whoʼs strong …,</p>
                        <p>President: … and if you want excellent intelligence, I donʼt see why you keep them on a carrier where they canʼt see anything.</p>
                        <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0129"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: The politics of 400 and of 1,500 are identical it seems to me.</p>
                        <p>President: I would let them get my intelligence. Iʼd let them know this and that. You might get some of them killed, thatʼs the only thing. I would think we would likely know more about whatʼs happening, likely to be a greater deterrent; seems to me everything would be in favor of having more people aboard because we could get our people out better, and round them up better.</p>

                        <p>To summarize: Junta ground forces have not moved toward rebels because of tired unfed troops, lack of adequate communications, and interservice bickering. It looks that way as result weakness inefficiency and indecisiveness of local military leadership as indicated in fact they failed today to take any significant action to close out the situation. Wessin has done little or nothing for last three days but now pleads weariness mechanical troubles with tanks many of his people shot up and troops exhausted. Other commanders take same position and Montas shows complete disorganization as supreme chief of forces. De los Santos has been steadfast but reluctant do any more bombing except in direct support of troops and no action of that type “little or no” has been forthcoming. Army Attaché returned short while ago from San Isidro. His report about same as that of Air Attaché who spent last night there and returned early this morning. Army Attaché found everyone there dead on feet and arguing among themselves as to how job should be done. This is repeat of yesterday (snipers are busy at <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> again and lights have just gone out). Army Attaché gave those present briefing on classic tactics for securing urban areas they appeared interested and heartened by his briefing and as he was leaving they were actively discussing the points he had made. Whether this means they will do more than talk is somewhat problematical in view of inactivity of yesterday and today despite superiority of forces. At this stage their troops have flagging morale and attachés do not doubt they will be defecting in some numbers tonight. Inaction and indecision has been characteristic of most military commanders on junta side during this crisis. There has been also some San Cristobal political activity going on and with Marine landing yesterday I frankly think they have some feeling—at least some people like Montas Peguero and perhaps Wessin that they can sit back now and let <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> do an efficient job for them. We should resist getting drawn in this way to maximum extent possible which would not cause operation to fail. In sending Air Attaché to San Isidro a few minutes ago to talk with leadership I instructed him to tell them, in connection with our landings this afternoon, that we do not intend to do their job for them. We can discuss more of that later. When they asked Air Attaché to come to San Isidro just now De Los Santos asked him to set down behind hangars at distance from headquarters this might imply further deterioration in relations between De Los Santos on one hand and Montas group on other. We probably wonʼt know more bout this until Fishburn returns. Naval Attaché returned short while ago from meeting with Navy Chief Rivera. He was with <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0132"/>Imbert Luna and Col Casado (in charge 200 men in National Palace). Morale of these officers much higher and they attempting clean up attack toward east with or without approval Montas. Officers complaining their forces are not adequately equipped to fight tanks and automatic weapons. They appear eager to fight and if given proper equipment and means of communication.</p>

                        <p>Believe safety zone of kind described would not be desirable as announced policy because area involved comprises residential area inhabited mostly by upper classes, this would discriminate against Dominican residents of poorer districts. Same purpose could be achieved by representing our advance as logical move stemming from presence our forces in western outskirts of city in cooperative effort with <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0133"/>Dominican forces proceeding from other directions. Regardless of how mission publicly represented, believe it would not be possible to establish completely secure area of size contemplated with forces presently available.</p>

However, must emphasize that this western section of city is infested with roving bands and snipers. Marines have just killed fifth of latter on perimeter Embassy grounds. As for negotiation political settlement, bitterness of struggle has hardened both sides against negotiation. We should bear in mind that we are dealing with mad dogs now as regards leftist forces. We should avoid any settlement which would give this group status or foothold in arrangements looking toward legitimate government.</item>

                        <p>On April 30, 1965, from 8:30 to 10:45 a.m., a meeting on the Dominican Republic took place in the White House Cabinet Room. Until 9:40 a.m., when President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> entered the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">General Wheeler</persName>, Bromley Smith, <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName>, Moyers, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName>, Dick Goodwin, <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> discussed the April 29 <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> meeting (see <ref target="#d45fn2">footnote 2, Document 45</ref>); U.S. efforts to send an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> contingent to the Dominican Republic; and the possibility of sending <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName> to the Dominican Republic. <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName>ʼs handwritten notes of the remainder of the meeting follow:</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName>: Has doubts about the Communists in charge—<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has no doubts. Rebels are not all of the same stripe. With [American] troops in the country it is difficult to talk with the rebels.</p>
                        <p>“LBJ: I am not willing to let this island go to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> is a phantom—they are taking a siesta while this is on fire. How can we send troops 10,000 miles away and let <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> take over right under our nose. Letʼs just analyze—we have resisted Communists all over the world: Vietnam, Lebanon, and Greece. What are we doing under our doorstep. We know the rebel leaders are Communist, and we are sitting here waiting on <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. We know <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> will hate us. We got rid of the dictator and we will now get a real dictator.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We can move through the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and achieve what you want. <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName> can communicate on two levels 1) with rebels, and 2) with groups who can oppose rebels.</p>
                        <p>“LBJ: (to <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>) Why donʼt you first find out what we need to take that island. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, why donʼt you determine what it takes to make this take on the right color.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: We have no international cover. We have no real legitimacy.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Danger of rebel troops and uprising in the countryside.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Danger of junta renouncing <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> because they sense anti-Communist sentiment.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: One to two divisions can clean up the island. We can have one division in 30 hours.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: We ought to wait a day. By that time we can have some legitimate cover.</p>
                        <p>“LBJ: 2 dangers: 1) wind up with [illegible] support with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> government, 2) or <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>-dominated in a short time. We have done little in the past several days.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: We have done a great deal. We are talking about a division going in and we couldnʼt do that several days ago.</p>

                        <p>“LBJ: I think enough leaders are there to make it <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. Not all Cubans were Communist. I am ashamed of the little we have done.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: But we have done considerable; we have put men ashore without real angry response.</p>
                        <p>“LBJ: I want <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> to get ready so that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> cannot take over.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Before we move, open press corps—show evidence of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> takeover—evidence irrefutable. Until we act, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> will be in command of the island—China Reds. Call on Latin American countries to join <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in support to crush Communist threat. Call on Dominican Republic citizens to organize their own government. Must have some government to get behind. Asked <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to come in to save their island from communism.</p>
                        <p>“LBJ: I want <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to feverishly try to cloak this with legitimacy. We cannot stand with our hand in our pocket and let <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> win. Military get ducks in a row. Diplomats see if we can do anything to get observers in here or troops from other Latin American countries. We are willing to do whatever is necessary to put the pistols down. We will have one of 3 dictators: 1) U.S., 2) Moderate dictator, 3) <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> dictator.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: Here are some thoughts that may or may not be helpful to you. One thing is clear: a <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> victory in the D.R. would [be] the worst domestic political disaster we could possibly suffer. But in order to quash <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> in D.R. we need above all else to get hemispheric public opinion on our side. We can do it this way: Before we move call an open press conference. 1. Show indisputable evidence that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>-Communists are in control in the D.R. (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> ought to prepare full dossiers) Vital that this [be] proven without a doubt. If can be linked to Chinese reds all the better. 2. Call on D.R. citizens to rise up (if at all possible, a group of responsible D.R. Citizens should cry out for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to save them from <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>). 3. Call on Latin-American countries to join with us—(if we can announce 2–3 or 4 countries who are with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> all the better). 4. Give the choice: stand by [and] do nothing, let <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> take over or with the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and local entreaties move in to quell the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> people and save this island from black darkness. We must lay the public opinion base—a clear choice: freedom versus <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>; citizens cry out for help versus <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> reds.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, Office of the President File, <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName> Meeting Notes)</p>

                        <p>According to a history of this crisis prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, after the April 30, 1965, meeting on the Dominican Republic (see <ref target="#d42">Document 42</ref>): “<persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">General Wheeler</persName> reviewed Admiral Mastersonʼs (Commander of Joint Task Force 122, directly under <gloss target="#t_CINCLANT1">CINCLANT</gloss>) plan and concluded that assigned forces, particularly the ground elements, were too weak for the task. He alerted the MEB and the airborne divisions and, (the entire 82nd Airborne Division with the 101st Airborne Division ready in reserve) with <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>ʼs approval, moved some amphibious shipping from Virginia to North Carolina, near the Marine base at Camp Lejeune. The JCS decided that Lt. <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">Gen.

                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion during which <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName> reported that he had just spoken to <persName corresp="#p_BJ2">Jaime Benitez</persName> who had in turn spoken to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> himself had been talking to <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName>, the rebel leader. <persName corresp="#p_BJ2">Benitez</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> had just captured Fort Ozama and 21 tanks. <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> that he would announce “a military victory” from San Juan and also call for a cease-fire. At this point in the conversation, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> excused himself for a moment to try to get <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> on the line, but <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> had just left his office.]</p>
                        <p>President: I had tried to explain to [<persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>] that I hoped for some prospect of internationalizing this thing: a. To get the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> to meet again today. They just adjourned until tomorrow and said they decided to sleep today. And try to get some of the sympathetic liberal forces in the hemisphere to send an observer or send a military contingent. Weʼve been doing all this for a week; they donʼt do it. Theyʼre killing our people and as you say they have captured tanks now; theyʼre taking over the police marching them down the street and they got a hundred of them as hostages. Our <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> says this is a completely led, operated, dominated—theyʼve got men on the inside of it; itʼs a <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> operation. It started out as a <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> operation but heʼs been moved completely out of the picture. They shoved them out and completely took over.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: Mr. President this may very well be true. I donʼt doubt it. I have a very simple point which is that our first objective is to make it clear that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is calling for a cease fire.</p>
                        <p>President: Well if we can do that before they take everything theyʼve got and set up their government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: It [the cease-fire] should be happening right now.</p>
                        <p>President: Thatʼs good. I want you to tell [<persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>] this.</p>
                        <p>[At this point <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName> tells President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_BJ2">Benitez</persName> had told him that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> had contacted <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> and wanted him to accept a cease-fire.]</p>
                        <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0139"/>
                        <p>President: The difficulty, though, is if <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is their [the rebelsʼ] captive. Where are the American interests, what do we do?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: I think the first thing we should do, Mr. President, is to show that this is a <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>-Communist operation. The most dramatic way of doing this is to have <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> call for a cease-fire and let those damn guys continue fighting.</p>
                        <p>President: Not going to be anything to fight though, <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe</persName>, because they [rebels] will have it [the Dominican Republic.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: This is right now.</p>
                        <p>President: Yes, as I say, if they got the tanks and if the people are capitulating, and if they got all the police, will there be anybody left to fight? It looks like they will have it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: Mr. President, if <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> calls for a cease-fire and Wessin agrees to it, theyʼll continue fighting, the Communists [will] continue fighting.</p>
                        <p>President: They wonʼt; theyʼll just take charge and start running the government, I think.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: I donʼt see how they could do that [inaudible].</p>
                        <p>President: Weʼre not stopping them from running the government. Since last Saturday,<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">April 24.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> lasted for a few hours, then <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> started operating; they got 45 more in there last night—trained, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>-trained, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>-operated people. Weʼre doing nothing to them. They started firing, they came in here last night and said to me at 7 oʼclock that weʼve got 900 men, the most elite force in Santo Domingo holed up here in prison.<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">Presumably President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> is referring to an April 29 meeting on the Dominican Republic held in the White House Cabinet Room from 7:30 to 9:10 p.m. In addition to the President, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">General Wheeler</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VJH1">Vaughn</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>, and Moyers attended the meeting. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, Presidentʼs Daily Diary) No other record of this meeting has been found.</note> Now, what do we do about it? I said letʼs protect them. “No, we canʼt do that,” because that would be partiality. I said, well letʼs get them out and evacuate them and get them to another part of the island. Oh, we canʼt do that because that would be sending our Navy in and the Ambassador says that would be showing partiality. And then I said, letʼs get the Dominican Navy to evacuate them from the Communists. They said all right, weʼll do that. [At] 2:30 they called me and said they couldnʼt get the Dominican Navy because it was in machine gun fire and the Dominican Navy didnʼt want anything to do with it.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4">Not further identified.</note> So, I get up this morning and they take 900 of the people who are not Communists, the best police we have got on the island, and the Communists <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0140"/>have taken them. So they had added 900 to their strength of 1900 and marched them down the streets of Santo Domingo with guns to their backs and theyʼre taking a hundred of them and saying “weʼre going to kill you” unless these people quit and give up. They havenʼt eaten in three days and are about ready to give up. The question is what does the United States do? Weʼve done this now for a week—nothing; weʼve done nothing because we donʼt want to be partial. But they are firing consistently every hour on our Embassy and when we can locate a sniper we shoot at them and we kill four or five. But the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> spent all night denouncing us. We finally got a cease fire out of them.</p>
                        <p>Hereʼs what I think we ought to do: I think we ought to get the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to give <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> name, address, chapter and verse—I donʼt mean to surface all that, but I mean to show that we got proof so that a lawyer like you [could] say that this is a case of Cuba doing this job; thatʼs number one. Number two, we ought to have our military forces in sufficient quantity, an adequate number appropriate ready to take that island. If we can get any other forces to join <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> well and good. Before we act weʼll try that, but to take that island so that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> doesnʼt take it. Next thing, we ought to try to get a cease-fire. Next, we ought to try to get the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> to send a team in today instead of sleeping through the day. Next, I think we ought to invite the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, any of their countries, or anybody else for that matter who wants to prevent bloodshed and to preserve peace to go in and join with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to be sure itʼs not just a United States operation. But if all this fails Iʼm not going to sit here and say I think down the road I can work it out after a Communist government sets up and starts issuing orders.</p>

                        <p>695. Following are high points of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy towards current crisis:
<list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Last night <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Council called for a cease-fire.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">By request of the United States, the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Council of Ministers met on April 29 in Washington from 10 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. and adopted two resolutions. The second called for an immediate cease-fire and the establishment of “an international neutral zone of refuge” in the Santo Domingo area. This resolution was introduced by the United States and was adopted by a vote of 16 to 0, with 4 abstentions (Chile, Mexico, Uruguay, and Venezuela). (<hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy Current Documents, 1965</hi>, pp. 958–959) The first resolution adopted called, in part, for a “Meeting of the Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> May 1, 1965” and “to approve as the agenda for this Meeting the serious situation created by the armed strife in the Dominican Republic.” This resolution, introduced by Chile, was adopted by a vote of 18 to 1 (Uruguay), with 1 abstention (Dominican Republic). (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, May 17, 1965, p. 739)</note> You should therefore use your influence to persuade Junta forces that no useful purpose will be served by rash or ill-advised military action. This does not mean of course that they should not defend themselves against attack. Their most important immediate risk is to preserve their existence as organized Dominican force as base for earliest possible effective expansion.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Junta should understand that crisis is entering a political phase and they should make every effort to capitalize on their position as the only existing organized authority in the Dominican Republic. They should use this position in order to ensure that <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> action will not result in ascendency of communist groups to political power in the Dominican Republic. Our tactics will be designed to support Junta in the achievement of this objective.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>We are seriously concerned with change in Junta attitude regarding role of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military forces. It may be that Junta believes that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intends to attack and eliminate rebel forces in the city. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> immediate objective is to establish safety zone referred to in last nightʼs <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Council resolution. In so far as <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military forces in San Isidro are concerned, immediate objective is to secure their position there and Ozama bridges leading to it. Strictly FYI: Subject to later developments, second phase of plan would be to establish a defensive line around rebel held portion of city so as to contain them there and give Junta forces opportunity to rest and re-group and to establish its authority over balance of city and countryside. End strictly FYI.</item>

                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>You should point out to Junta leaders that <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> last night made an “urgent appeal” to “permit the immediate establishment of international neutral zone of refuge encompassing the geographic area of the City of Santo Domingo immediately surrounding the Embassies of foreign governments”. Point out to Junta that our hope is that the establishment of such a zone by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces will not be opposed by rebel forces and that such a zone will considerably reduce the perimeter which the Junta itself is obliged to defend. Junta cooperation to this end is essential.</item>

                                <item>You should solicit assistance Diplomatic Corps to carry out last nightʼs appeal of COAS for cease-fire and for establishment of safety zone.</item>

                        <p>On April 30, 1965, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> held several telephone conversations with his top advisers between 5 and 7 p.m. on a proposed statement to the press regarding Communist involvement in the Dominican crisis. In the first of these conversations with Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> at 5:05 p.m., <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed his strong belief that the President of the United States should not be the person to “point a finger to the Communistsʼ participation in this.” <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> thought President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> would have “a pretty tough job proving that the Inter-American system was being menaced by powers outside the republic and were trying to gain control.” President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> responded, “We all know they are. What is wrong with my saying it?” <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said, “The rest of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> can say things like that and we donʼt have to prove it, but you have got a handful of people there but you donʼt know that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> is trying to do anything. You would have a hard time proving to any group that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> has done more than train these people, and we have trained a lot of people and he has trained a lot of people. I think it puts your own status and prestige too much on the line. The rest of the statement I think is excellent, but to say you as President [have] personal knowledge that powers outside the hemisphere are trying to subvert this government or those people, I donʼt think you are in a very strong position to say that.”</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked if the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> could document <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs involvement and <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that he didnʼt think so. He thought the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> might show certain people were trained in Cuba, but not that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> was directing the training. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">Robert McNamara</persName>, Tape F65.14, Side A, PNO 6)</p>
                        <p>At 5:40 p.m. <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> resumed their telephone conversation about the press statement. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> opened the conversation by saying, with a sense of urgency, “I have this feeling if we donʼt take over that island within the next 24 hours <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0145"/>or before the last man folds, we never will. I may be wrong, but if I am wrong I want you to tell me.” <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> responded by again expressing his objections to a statement that includes a sentence “people trained outside [the Dominican Republic] are seeking to gain control.” Bill Moyers, who was in the Presidentʼs office at the time of this conversation, added that he thought such a sentence was unnecessary and to include it “would raise the prestige and status of the Cubans because it declares publicly that “we believe the Communists are behind this.” (Ibid., Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">Robert McNamara</persName>, Tape F65.14, Side A, PNO 7)</p>
                        <p>By 6 p.m. when President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> talked to <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> on the telephone, the final draft of the press statement was still not approved by the Presidentʼs top advisers. During their conversation <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> promised the President that he would have a statement before the close of business that evening. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> fearing that would be too late responded:
<quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I think while we were talking yesterday we ought to have been acting. I think we ought to have been doing yesterday what we did today. I think we finally got some people doing something today. I think theyʼre going to have that island in another 24 hours. I think weʼve got no basis for any action. I think this statement is a predicate and kind of puts your hand up your dress. Morse has just made his speech; he compliments <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> but he said our only basis of action is to keep the Communists from taking over. We wonʼt even admit that thereʼs anybody down there, that there is any conspiracy. We have run under the table and hid and told them nothing … I know that when we go all day in a hot situation like this without saying anything, and wait until late in the evening until they [the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>] act, I know that we are going to look like we are just a bunch of interveners and not peacemakers at all.”</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> replied that he still felt the President could get his point across by “hinting to these things … by sticking to our existing position.” The conversation ended with the President saying he really wanted to deliver a statement and hoped his advisers would soon reach agreement on a draft. (Ibid., Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, Tape F65.14, Side A, PNO 10)</p>
                        <p>At 6:25 p.m. <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> placed a telephone call to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. Again they debated the contents of what would become the fourth paragraph in the final version of the statement. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had voiced his objections to the Presidentʼs statement saying “there are disturbing signs” in the Dominican Republic because to do so would be to “take on the liberals” and “the Communists.” <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed and advocated that the President deliver a statement without reference to the line in question, even if it was “just a handout to the press.” But President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> did not completely agree. He said: “What worries me, Bob, is that Iʼm not being <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0146"/>quite honest with them. I think we do know and every citizen of this country knows that there are disturbing signs there, and there are people trained outside in there, and I think if I donʼt say so it looks like Iʼm concealing it and trying to cover up.” <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said that with or without the sentence in question he thought any statement would be worthwhile. The conversation ended with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> undecided about whether he should deliver the statement. (Ibid., Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">Robert McNamara</persName>, Tape F65.14, Side B, PNO 2)</p>
                        <p>At 6:30 p.m. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> telephoned <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to seek his approval on the latest version of the statement. This version replaced the word “powers” with the word “people” in the sentence “powers trained outside the Dominican Republic are seeking to gain control of the rebel movement,” a veiled reference to Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he agreed with this change because “it separates the <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> people from the Communists.” <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> who were in <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>ʼs office at the time of this telephone call concurred. (Ibid., Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>, Tape F65.14, Side B, PNO 3)</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> held one last telephone conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> at 6:35 p.m. before he decided to deliver his statement at 7:07 p.m. in the Theater at the White House. The text of the statement is in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>
                            </hi>, Book I, pages 465–466. During this conversation <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> told the President he still felt that the latest version of the statement might commit the President to a “civil war against Communists that arenʼt in charge.” <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said that although the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had identified eight Communist-trained rebels, “nobody has yet said that anyone of these Communists is actually in command of a column.” <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said he “wasnʼt sure that these Communists were that much in control of this messy movement,” and he “wouldnʼt this evening point the finger that hard at the Communists.” After <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> and the President “doctored down” the language by removing the words “disturbing” and “dangerous elements” from the fourth paragraph, the President asked one last question: did <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> think delivering the statement would “handicap” them. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said, “no, not too much.” With that response the President ended the conversation.

Mann</persName>, Telephone Conversations with LBJ, Jan. 14, 1964–April 30, 1965)</note> and he talked to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. His general conclusion is that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is essentially out of control and probably that <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Colonel Camano</persName> is also out of control. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is bitter and lays all of the responsibility to our failure to communicate, to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>ʼs vindictiveness, our failure to respond to <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Colonel Camano</persName>ʼs complaints of firing by our troops, and to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName>ʼs failure to communicate effectively between the Commanding General and <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Colonel Camano</persName>.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe</persName> told him that all this was irrelevant and that the essential point now is that the rebels are still firing in a time of cease-fire and that no one could answer for the consequences if this firing did not stop. <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe</persName> does not think we can expect much from this and suggested a desperate effort by <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">John Martin</persName> to re-establish contact in the city and press for observance of the cease-fire.

On the political side we cleared the revised instructions to <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> and reinforced existing efforts for longer-range planning.<note n="10" xml:id="d49fn10">Not found.</note> But after considerable discussion we agreed with <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> that the situation on the ground is decisive and we will have to play the political moves by ear, and day-by-day. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> went off to see Betancourt, and I strongly urged him to give Betancourt encouragement and keep the Betancourt plan<note n="11" xml:id="d49fn11">Two telegrams, 010729Z and 810239Z, both dated May 1, from the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to the Director of the National Security Agency reported that <persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">José Figueres</persName>, former President of Costa Rica, and Romulo Betancourt, former President of Venezuela, discussed the previous day the possibility of introducing a motion to the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Council on May 1 calling for the establishment of a four-nation (Venezuela, Costa Rica, Colombia, United States) military and governmental command in the Dominican Republic.

                        <p>The rebel forces continue to dominate the military situation and are apparently using the tenuous cease fire to strengthen their positions. <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0150"/>Numbering between two and five thousand, they are concentrated in the southeastern area of the city. The rebels appear to be well armed, adequately supplied and determined to continue the fight.</p>

                        <p>The loyalist forces are completely inadequate even to police the cease fire. Most of the troops under Brigadier General Wessin y Wessin, numbering about 1,250 men, have withdrawn to the east side of the Duarte Bridge for their own safety. Brigadier General Salvador Montas Guerrero with about 200 men has apparently abandoned the National Palace leaving the entire southeastern area under rebel control. Army Chief Rivera Cuesta is commanding about 400 troops in the northwestern part of the city and 1,200 naval combat troops are deployed around the fair grounds. Approximately 2,400 police are defending their headquarters and the police radio station. There are no other loyalist troops in the city.</p>

                        <p>As of 0430 EDT <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military forces in the Dominican Republic totalled 7,874—including 2,955 Marines and 4,919 Army troops. Marine casualties are two killed and 20 wounded; Army casualties are one killed, another probably killed and 16 wounded. A large gap still remains between the 82nd Airborne and the Marine phase line in the western part of the city. Many of the Army casualties occurred early last night when a patrol was sent from the Army beachhead at the Duarte Bridge to the Marine phase line.</p>

                        <p>Various reports show that the interior generally remains calm and this may indicate a lack of sympathy for the rebel cause. The longer the present situation exists, however, the greater is the chance that the countryside will grow more restive. A report via ham radio last night from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Consul in Santiago, the countryʼs second largest city, stated that while all communications are out, conditions in the consular district are generally good, with Dominican military and police units in effective control. The highway to Santiago remains closed since rebels reportedly overran a police post at Villa Altagracia yesterday.</p>

                        <p>Neither the rebels nor the loyalists now appear to have the ability or the means to form an effective instrument of national political control. The rebels, aside from their insistence that the “constitutionalist forces” take over the government, are believed to be thoroughly divided over how this should properly be done and who should play what role. This fragmentation serves only the purposes of the Communists and extremists who now dominate the rebel movement. <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0151"/>

Most informed Latin American officials at the moment probably have little or no sympathy for the Communists and extremists whom they have learned are dominating the Dominican rebel forces. By the same token, however, neither do they have any sympathy for the military forces such as General Wessin and other officers leading the loyalist forces. Any sudden change for the better in the loyalistsʼ fortunes would be viewed with deep suspicion by most other Latin American countries.</p>

                            <item>The rebels probably have two immediate goals: (1) to use the present lull to consolidate their positions in the capital and to stimulate provincial areas to declare for them; and (2) to insure themselves a “large piece” of whatever arrangement the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> authorities are finally able to put together.</item>

                            <item>As the present situation becomes more fixed, we believe the status of the rebel forces will receive increasing if grudging support from other Latin Americans. Certainly the international repugnance to any effort to “clean out” the rebel area will grow as each day passes. This could, of course, be reversed if the rebels should become aggressive and persistently violate the truce.</item>

                                    <p>One object of the information operation should be to make it clear that we are not tied closely to Wessin. This is hurting <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> with the Dominican people.</p>

                                        <hi rend="italic">The Military Situation</hi>—It was reported that the President wanted to get two more battalions of troops into the Dominican Republic as soon as possible. In this regard, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the troops in question would be in the Dominican Republic by May 3.</p>
                                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> gave the details on three possible plans to isolate the rebels. <hi rend="italic">Plan A</hi> would be the tightest perimeter and would close most of the rebels off in the southeast corner of the city. This would take two <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0153"/>divisions to set up, 7 days to complete, and involve heavy casualties. <hi rend="italic">Plan B</hi>, which would start a little north of the bridge and move west-southwest, would give the rebels more room. It would take one division to set up, 24 hours to complete, and involve medium casualties. <hi rend="italic">Plan C</hi>, which would give the rebels all of Santo Domingo, would take 3 to 5 days to complete and one division and one brigade to hold. It would involve the fewest casualties.</p>
                                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">General Wheeler</persName> recommended <hi rend="italic">Plan B</hi>, and after considerable discussion, the group agreed. Among other things, the heavy casualties made <hi rend="italic">Plan A</hi> unacceptable. Among other things, <hi rend="italic">Plan C</hi> would give the rebels the whole city; they could credibly declare a provisional government. Among other things, <hi rend="italic">Plan B</hi> was quick, militarily the soundest, and, in fact, could be accomplished by less than a division. It would close in most of the rebels; if there was a subsequent problem, <hi rend="italic">Plan C</hi> could be added on to <hi rend="italic">Plan B</hi>.</p>

The group agreed that we should try to get the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Commission to recommend the establishment of a “line of communications.” This recommendation could be a part of a series of such recommendations as the following: (a) a request for a cease-fire; (b) a call for all civilians to turn in their arms; (c) a request for the provision of relief.</item>

<list>
                                        <label>(a)</label>
                                        <item>It might be desirable to get a team of such people as Betancourt and <persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">Figueres</persName> to go to the Dominican Republic and to act as advisors to whatever government is put together.</item>

                                        <item>As a start towards establishing some order, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> mentioned the desirability of establishing three councils of the provinces.

                                            <p>The group discussed the problem of how we move away from the Junta. It was generally agreed that, while we need a civilian government and while we are not enamored by Wessin, we may not yet want to go too far in leaning away from the Junta; it would probably break completely whatever authority the Junta still has.</p>
                                            <p>The group agreed that we ought to guard against giving the rebels any political stature at this time.</p>

                                            <p>In discussing possible Dominican leaders, the name of Tony Imbert came up. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that, even though he is no jewel, he might be one of the best of a sorry lot. While he has played footsie with the Communists, <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> is not a Communist, is tough, and could never be accused of being a Trujillo man; in this latter regard, he was the man who pulled the trigger on Trujillo.</p>
                                            <p>The possibility of using <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was discussed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FJF1">Fitzgerald</persName> made the point that if <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> were used as an interim provisional leader, he would be out of the running as a long-term leader in the future; this would be too bad. The group decided, however, that the situation is so critical that options involving <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> should be explored further.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Press Handling</hi>—Mr. Greenfield urged that we more openly discuss the Communist angle of the Dominican situation; our evacuation fig leaf is just not all that credible. Most of the group, however, believed that, on May 3 at least, we should speak relatively softly on this angle and concentrate attention on the relief aspects of the Dominican operation.</item>

                        <p>This line of communication must be maintained for protection of zone and to maintain access to airfield so as to make possible evacuation of persons of all nationalities. Also overland communication between San Isidro and safety zone is necessary for elementary military reasons.</p>

                                <item>Tacit or if possible expressed recognition that maintenance of essential line of communication is not violation of cease fire and is not aggressive in design.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>Hopefully this announcement would prevent forces between the bridge and the safety zone from misinterpreting maintenance of communication line as offensive against them and hence reduce bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>We leave exact hour of announcement to you and <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName> inasmuch as we do not yet know the exact hour of departure of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces from Duarte Bridge. Repeat it is important that announcement be coordinated closely with departure so as not to give excessive advance opportunity to hostile forces to group along communication line.</p>
                        <p>Strictly FYI. Line of communication will be essentially the one scouted yesterday by 82nd Airborne patrol. Establishment of other possible perimeters have been considered and discarded. We understand that Defense wishes that movement be made in daylight hours. If we receive Commission approval in time to proceed this afternoon, this will be done. Otherwise it is planned that movement will take place tomorrow morning. Would therefore appreciate early estimate on when we may expect word from you regarding <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Commissionʼs reaction.</p>
                        <p>We will maintain line of communication irrespective of attitude of Commission. But we think that cooperation of Commission gives <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> political base and hopefully reduces dimensions of fighting. It would be good if you could get agreement from Commission on all three points but any one of three would be better than none.</p>
                        <p>Defense is issuing necessary instructions along these general lines to <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>. End strictly FYI.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">The Military Situation</hi>—The group agreed that, with the line of communications established and many troops in place, the military situation was in relatively good shape. <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">General Wheeler</persName> said that we will probably not have to go beyond the 14,000- or 15,000-troop level.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">According to a JCS history of this intervention, on May 2 the JCS approved the deployment of an additional Marine battalion and the remaining five battalions of the 82nd Airborne Division. When these units arrived in Santo Domingo May 3–4, U.S. strength ashore stood at 12 maneuver battalions, approximately 21,000 men. Because Cuban MiG–17s, 19s, and 21s could cover U.S. air transport routes and even reach Santo Domingo, the JCS on May 6 decided to supplement the F–100s at Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico, with faster F–104s.

                                    <hi rend="italic">Latin American Reaction</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that the Latin Americans are going to give <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> a lot of trouble and went on to make the following points with respect to the Latin American mentality on this sort of operation. <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, over the years, we and the Latin Americans, in a number of documents and in a variety of forums, have expressed a general belief in the principle of non-intervention. At the same time, the Latin Americans, for many years, have recognized the necessity for collective defense against attacks on the Hemisphere. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, the basic problem is that Latin American theology does not reflect the fact that aggression does not have to be armed military attack; it can also come in the form of subversion. Thus, with unpleasant memories of Marines in mind and not really accepting the idea of subversion as aggression which must be resisted collectively, the Latin Americans tend to adhere to the traditional line on intervention and think that we are engaged again in gunboat diplomacy. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, there are, of course, some sophisticated Latin Americans who know what the score is. Privately, they say “good show” but, publicly, they give <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> no support. The problem here is that secret support does <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> no damn good. <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, the sophisticated Latin Americans, who wish <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> well, probably did not like to see <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> dilute our evacuation fig leaf and switch emphasis to the anti-Communist argument.</p>
                                <p>It was noted that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had seen and the President would be seeing Betancourt in an effort to gain support for the U.S. position in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d55fn4">See <ref target="#d56">Document 56</ref> and <ref target="#d56fn5">footnote 5</ref> thereto.</note> It was also noted that one point we are trying to make to <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0160"/>the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> is that the Communists, in trying to subvert the Dominican Republic, are the ones who are intervening.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Information Program</hi>—Mr. Greenfield said that we must do something about proving the Communist intervention in the Dominican Republic; he noted that the press, with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> in mind, can accept the argument that a few organized Communists can make a big difference in a small country. All we have to do is prove that there really are some hard-core Communists in the Dominican Republic who are trying to subvert the country in an organized meaningful way.</p>
                                <p>The group agreed that this is a serious problem and that a task force should be set up to deal with it.<note n="5" xml:id="d55fn5">According to an attached list of actions to be taken, <persName corresp="#p_WAR1">Adams</persName> (State), Califano, and <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName> among others would be members of this task force, whose job was to build “as full and well documented a case as can be developed to support charge that the communists have taken over the revolution in the Dominican Republic.”</note> In searching about for new ideas, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> suggested that we interrogate rebels as they come out of the zone<note n="6" xml:id="d55fn6">The international neutral zone of safety set up in Santo Domingo on May 1.</note> while <persName corresp="#p_FD1">Des FitzGerald</persName> mentioned that he thinks he can find some still pictures of rebels wearing Fidel <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> caps.</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> was getting pictures of the evacuation every day. These are real human interest items. Mr. Greenfield said that he would be very interested in getting copies.</p>

As a general point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> emphasized that the President has a continuing and real interest in this dimension of the Dominican problem and that we should attempt to keep him fully informed on our activities in this area.</item>

He says that he would put his weight behind implementing the plan at anytime we give the go ahead and can assure him that non-rebel military forces would cooperate. Presumably he had counted on the elder General <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0162"/>

                            <p>The plan would go like this:

                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> wants this formula to bring the country back to constitutionality in a way that would cool the passions and emotions of many who are now in the forefront of the action. All forces would be calmed and reassured, according to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> feels that following this procedure would also head off a confrontation between the U.S. and the Dominican people who are seriously concerned over our present role, having been misled to believe that we are supporting the forces of military repression.</p>
                            <p>The elder <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> is apparently in regular contact with his son. Davidson reports that they spoke by telephone twice on the evening of May 2 from Davidsonʼs residence. Young <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> told his father that he is fighting for principles and ideals. He wants to return to constitutionality—free elections—an opportunity for the people to oust corrupt leaders and vote for the candidate of their choice. Young <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> reports, according to Davidson through the old General, that there is greater and growing anti-U.S. feelings among the young and idealistic men who make up the rebel forces. Young <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> tells his father he has 50,000 followers who will fight the U.S. Marines to the end.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> has avoided speaking directly with Davidson since <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> arrived in Washington but is committed to call him “sometime later today.”</p>

At the time of this meeting, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was considering a proposal first suggested by <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName> for a committee of “Wise Men” to act as trustees or overseers of the effort to bring about a resolution in the Dominican Republic. <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName> dictated this idea to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>ʼs secretary on May 1 at 11:15 a.m. <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName> said: “This is a very secret and confidential message. If the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> does not move, it seems to me you might consider the following after careful checking with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and everybody else, the designation of Betancourt, <persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">Figueres</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MML1">Marín</persName> as an interim committee, might be attempted. This is my own idea, not communicated or checked with anyone.” (Ibid., Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName>, Tape F65.16, Side A, PNO 3) The proposal was later abandoned in part because of opposition from some Latin American governments and from the existing five-nation Special Committee of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>; see <ref target="#d52fn2">footnote 2, Document 52</ref>.</note>

                        <p>The President outlined chronologically the events that preceded the sending of Marines to the Dominican Republic: increased chaos on Saturday,<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">April 24.</note> convening of the O.A.S. Peace Committee on Tuesday,<note n="3" xml:id="d56fn3">At 4 p.m. on April 27 the Inter-American Peace Committee, representatives from Colombia, Argentina, Dominican Republic and the United States, convened to hear Dominican Republic Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJ3">Bonilla</persName> give a report on the revoltʼs origins and developments.</note> meeting of the O.A.S. Council on Wednesday,<note n="4" xml:id="d56fn4">On April 28 at 10:30 a.m. a regular meeting of the Council of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> was held to discuss the Dominican Republic situation.</note> rapid deterioration of the situation on Wednesday afternoon, and decision to send the Marines late that same afternoon. He said that the failure of the O.A.S. to take any steps left the U.S. with no choice but to send in troops, in view of the announcement by the local authorities that they could no longer guarantee the safety of Americans residing in the Dominican Republic. He said that any President of a Latin American Republic would have made the same decision if his nationals were in danger.</p>
                        <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0164"/>
                        <p>The President also said that within hours of the landing of the Marines the U.S. had names, addresses, and other information concerning Communists and Castroites who were in the rebel ranks. The primary reason for the decision to send troops, a decision that had to be taken immediately, was to protect the lives of Americans and other foreign nationals who were in danger.</p>
                        <p>The mission of the American forces was to guarantee the safety of foreign nationals, including American, to keep bloodshed at a minimum, and to provide medical and food supplies to everybody in the Dominican capital.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Betancourt said that no matter how urgent the decision to send Marines had been, time should have been taken to call in the Latin American representatives to the O.A.S., even if just to announce to them the need for sending troops. This would have reduced the reaction of Latin American Presidents and Congresses, who have accused the U.S. of unilateral action.<note n="5" xml:id="d56fn5">During a meeting at 10:10 a.m. on May 3 Betancourt told the Secretary that “the United States had committed a serious error; it should have called a meeting of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, be it midnight or dawn, to inform the Latin American Ambassadors that Marines were on their way and why they were being sent … to avoid Latin America being faced with a fait accompli.” (Memorandum of conversation, May 3; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–9 DOM REP) <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> informed President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> of Betancourtʼs position during a telephone conversation that began at 11:15 a.m. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>, Tape F65.18, Side A, PNO 7)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Betancourt said that he had been pleased to hear Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> state that the U.S. was not thinking in terms of Wessin y Wessin or of any other Dominican military figure that had been equally rejected by the people as a basis for a government.<note n="6" xml:id="d56fn6">During <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>ʼs meeting with Betancourt (see <ref target="#d56fn5">footnote 5</ref> above), the Secretary admitted “privately” that he thought, “no members of the present Junta, or Wessin y Wessin, could form a government, since they had no popular support.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–9 DOM REP)</note> He said that he, together with <persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">José Figueres</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MML1">Luis Muñoz Marín</persName>, would use their good offices to convince <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> not to run for office again. He felt that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, as he had said before, was a good man and an anti-communist democrat, but was naive, and did not have the ability necessary to govern his country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Betancourt said that this Dominican experience should serve to illustrate the dangers of de facto governments in Latin America, and that what had happened on this island could also happen in Ecuador, Honduras, or Guatemala. He said that it was important that the inter-American conference that was to meet in Rio pass a vigorous resolution to have existing de facto governments call for elections, and to discourage those who might be thinking of a coup dʼetat.</p>
                        <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0165"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that it was obvious that the O.A.S. did not move rapidly, and that there were occasions, such as the one in the Dominican Republic, when action had to be taken promptly, in view of the danger to the lives of so many people, as well as the menace of the extremists in the rebel ranks. Mr. Betancourt, after listening to the explanation by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> of chronology of events leading to sending of troops to Dominican Republic, agreed that he would have done same thing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Betancourt agreed that a communist victory in the Dominican Republic was unacceptable. He said that the events on that island should serve as a warning, to illustrate the fact that the people of Latin America wanted freedom and elected governments. He also said that whatever solution was reached in the O.A.S. required only 14 votes, and that the U.S. should not devote too much effort to obtain the votes of the so-called large countries, such as Mexico and Argentina. If the U.S. had a solution, it could get it approved with the support of Colombia, Venezuela, and Costa Rica, and that no effort should be made to obtain unanimity.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked Mr. Betancourt what possible solution could be found for the Dominican problem, be it a provisional or a trusteeship government. Mr. Betancourt replied that both were possibilities, and that he had considered the idea of a trusteeship government, to include the representatives of Costa Rica (<persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">José Figueres</persName>), Colombia (Alberto Lleras Camargo), Venezuela (Rómulo Betancourt), with the possible addition of former Governor <persName corresp="#p_MML1">Luis Muñoz Marín</persName>.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked whether Mr. Betancourt could suggest some responsible persons in the Dominican Republic who might be approached in the search for a viable solution. Mr. Betancourt replied that he did not know enough about the Dominican Republic, because of the isolation surrounding the island during the Trujillo era.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that any comments to the press speak of the fact that he and Mr. Betancourt had known each other for a long time, that they had discussed Latin America in the twentieth century and the Alliance for Progress. Mr. Betancourt agreed, and said that he would prefer to draft a written press release, which he would send to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> before he gave it to the press.<note n="7" xml:id="d56fn7">Not further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Betancourt said that he wished to emphasize the information he had received from the Venezuelan consul in Santo Domingo, whom he regarded as a reliable observer, to the effect that communists <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0166"/>were by no means in control of the rebel forces in the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Betancourt said that he would be available to the President at any time he was called to make a contribution to good inter-American relations. The President said that he would surely call on him, and that he would be glad to see Mr. Betancourt any time he so desired.</p>

Dominican developments since last sitrep (Depcirctel 2097).<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">Circular telegram 2097, May 1, informed embassies that the Papal Nuncio, Emanuele Clarizio, had successfully mediated a cease-fire to begin at 11:45 a.m. April 30 Santo Domingo time. (Ibid.) At 2 a.m. on April 30, the Council of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> adopted a resolution calling for a cease-fire in Santo Domingo and an international neutral zone of safety in the neighborhood of the foreign embassies.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Rebel group has formed government headed by <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Col. Francisco Caamano</persName>. We anticipate group will shortly seek recognition from other American Republics. We believe rebels are heavily infiltrated by Dominican Communists. Rebel group holds only small sector (about one square mile) of Santo Domingo and has no control elsewhere in country. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> opposes recognition of <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> “government” since it meets none of criteria for recognition.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> partisans appear to have lost control of movement to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>-Communist elements. There is increasing evidence that Cuban trained guerrilla leaders are now playing a major role in the rebel camp.</p>
                        <p>Our Embassy reports the continuing lack of any effective government in the Dominican Republic and notes the incapacity of the present military Junta to govern. Country outside Santo Domingo remains peaceful however.</p>
                        <p>Military situation remains quiet. U.S. troops have established corridor through city to provide access to neutral zone from airfield several miles east of city proper. Army and Marines are assisting in <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0167"/>distribution of food to populace and have set up field hospitals to care for wounded civilians. U.S. Forces in D.R. now total 17,000.</p>
                        <p>Evacuation of U.S. and other foreign non-combatants is continuing. U.S. is assisting any foreign nationals who wish to leave Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>In U.N. Security Council, USSR and Cuba attacked and we defended our actions in the Dominican Republic. The <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Commission which has been in Santo Domingo since May 2 devoted most of yesterday to attempting to obtain concurrence of <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and Junta commands to the “Act of Santo Domingo.” Act includes (1) ratification of April 30 cease-fire, (2) establishment of Santo Domingo Security Zone,(3) guarantees of protection and security for all persons in said zone,(4) full cooperation with such international agencies as the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> may designate for food and medical supply distribution in the Dominican Republic, (5) guarantees for the evacuation of Embassy asylees, (6) respecting of Diplomatic Missions and any asylees who are in them, and (7) recognition of the full competence of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Commission for the purpose of complying with the provisions of the Act.</p>
                        <p>In the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, the U.S. Government has introduced a resolution calling for the creation of an inter-American force to maintain order in the Dominican Republic. As of 1800 hrs, May 4, support for the resolution stood as follows.</p>
                        <p>Ten L.A., in addition to the Dominicans, have indicated support. They are Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Paraguay.</p>
                        <p>Seven have indicated some opposition. They are Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Colombia.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss> has unanimously adopted a resolution urging all member countries to provide relief supplies and trained personnel for the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>In disaster relief activities, the American Red Cross has begun a program of direct assistance to the Dominican Red Cross.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Third <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Resolution</hi>—The group discussed the desirability of getting a third <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> resolution which primarily would permit a reconstituted <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Commission (a) to advise the Dominicans on the running of their government and (b) to eventually bring about elections. Among others, the following points were made during the discussion. <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, the group agreed that we should try to get <persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">Figueres</persName>, Betancourt, Lleras Camargo and <persName corresp="#p_MML1">Munoz Marin</persName> to constitute the new Commission.<note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">The proposed commission members were: <persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">José Figueres</persName>, former President of Costa Rica; Rómulo Betancourt, former President of Venezuela; Lleras Camargo, former President of Colombia; and <persName corresp="#p_MML1">Luis Muñoz Marin</persName>, former Governor of Puerto Rico. According to Tab 1 this third <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> resolution should: 1) broaden the powers of the Commission to advise the provisional government, 2) authorize <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> supervision of elections, 3) grant the Commission an effective role in rounding up and exiling communist elements from the Dominican Republic, and 4) give the Commission greater influence in the composition of the eventual Dominican Republic Government.

                                <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, the group felt that while we probably would be able to get the resolution we want, there will probably be some opposition. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> said that the Venezuelans may argue that this sort of <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> intervention will bring about a situation even more amenable to the communists. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> thought that the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> was a couple jumps away from sending a Commission down to the Dominican <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0169"/>Republic to really govern. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, the group felt that even a relatively weak resolution, gotten quickly, would be helpful. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> noted that the main thing is to get the Wise Men into the Dominican Republic. He added that, in getting rid of the <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> Government, it would be nice to have people like the Wise Men tell <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> that this is the right thing to do. <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> thought that we should do some contingency planning in the event we canʼt get an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> resolution. Even if we canʼt get a resolution, it would be good to get the Wise Men to the Dominican Republic.<note n="4" xml:id="d58fn4">

We cannot remain in association much longer with Wessin … the rebels are gaining power, position and prestige every passing day.” (Ibid., Recording of telephone conversation between <persName>Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>, Tape F65.20, Side B, PNO 2)</note>

                                <hi rend="italic">Unified Military Command</hi>—Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> said that there are variety of countries which seem to be ready to provide contingents for the Dominican Republic crisis—Costa Rica (police), Venezuela (destroyers), Brazil (1000 troops), Argentina and Colombia.<note n="5" xml:id="d58fn5">During a May 5 Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> the Ministers considered the establishment of an inter-American military force in the Dominican Republic. At 2 a.m. on May 6 the Ministers approved a U.S.-initiated resolution requesting that American states make military and police contingents available to form an Inter-American Armed Force (IAAF) which would operate under the authority of an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Unified Command (UC). This resolution was adopted by a vote of 15–5 (Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay), with 1 abstention (Venezuela). Subsequently, on June 2 the Meeting of Consultation adopted a resolution naming the force the “Inter-American Peace Force.” According to their own history of this intervention, the JCS had suggested that Latin military contributions consist of small, lightly equipped companies trained in riot control and guerrilla tactics, and that Argentinean and Brazilian battalions be infantry units. Tactical air contributions were not sought but naval contingents were. The JCS asked that these be coastal patrol vessels limited to 1–2 ships per country. The JCS also recommended that the Latin units rely on their own transportation, be as self sufficient as possible, and be capable of receiving and distributing bulk supplies from U.S. sources. (<hi rend="italic">JCS and National Policy: 1965–1968</hi>, p. 468)</note> The group agreed that the unified command should probably be run largely from the Dominican Republic. In this regard, we can send some lawyers down to the island to help Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> run the U.S. part of the show. The operation will be coordinated with Bill Saunders, the Assistant Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>.</item>

As an excuse, we can say that the effectiveness of the cease fire makes this possible; later on we can say that we are withdrawing because it is clear that the Latin Americans are coming in. The Secretary went on to say that we have 13 battalions in the Dominican Republic and we might think seriously of withdrawing 2 battalions, one at a time, over the next 72 hours.</p>

Mr. Greenfield noted that we will be in a much stronger position if we go to the altar willingly rather than reluctantly.

While the group saw certain advantages in bringing the Peace Corps back to the U.S., they also saw a number of disadvantages—e.g., Peace Corps people would hold their interviews in the U.S., which would also hurt; it would be a blow for the Peace Corps people all over the world if we quashed their right to speak freely.

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>It seems clear now as it did in the last days of April that a modest number of hard-core Communist leaders in Santo Domingo managed by superior training and tactics to win for themselves a position of considerable influence in the revolt within the first few days. Their influence within the movement grew day by day, and following the collapse of Molinaʼs government on 27 April there appeared to be no organization within the rebel camp capable of denying them full control of the rebellion within a very few days.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, the rebel cause, enjoying as it did the backing of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and the continued support of several thousand military personnel, seemed likely to prosper in the face of the ineffective and dispirited countermeasures of the loyalists military.</p>
                        <p>Thus the prospect at the time of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intervention clearly was one in which a movement increasingly under the influence of Castroites and other Communists was threatening to gain the ascendancy in the Dominican Republic.</p>

                                <p>Rebels Today: Virtually impossible assess rebel situation with confidence. Nuncio and <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> and others believe <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> realizes defeat inevitable and wants out but is virtual prisoner of hard-core Communists.</p>
                                <p>On other hand, sources equally reliable and in some ways better informed say that rebels are confident of victory. Is not impossible both views contain truth and change hour to hour.</p>
                                <p>I have opened several lines to <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and one to <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> and am helping with quiet effort to arrange <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>ʼs surrender or at least <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0178"/>negotiation with <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>. Am dubious, as of this hour, but intend pursue vigorously.</p>
                                <p>Unquestionably, rebels hold propaganda initiative principally through Radio Santo Domingo, and importance of this cannot be overstated. Rebels are organizing large (1200–1500 people yesterday) demonstrations center of town, with speakers emphasizing not <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> but anti-Americanism, plus pro-constitutionality, anti-Wessin, and pro-<persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>. Rebels, well led, are succeeding in linking in minds of uninformed masses “constitutionality” with food and jobs. In short, rebels are working to consolidate political position as champion of masses against <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military—San Isidro military-upperclass and middle-class government. And unquestionably, they are ahead of GRN in this propaganda political war.</p>

                                <p>GRN Today: I spent four days helping form GRN, running through scores of names and pressuring dozens of men to join it. Finding it impossible obtain truly broad-spectrum political group, took what we have. Needless to say, Ambassador concurred throughout. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>, though suspected of dictatorial ambitions, is symbol of DOM fight for freedom, since he assassinated Trujillo, and will not double-cross <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> on truly basic issues. Benoit seems unusually reasonable, intelligent DOM REP military man. Postigo was close personal friend <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and has irreproachable reputation as civic leader. His personal sacrifice in joining GRN is enormous. Grisolia, though former <gloss target="#t_UCN1">UCN</gloss> senator, is stable, reasonable, and cannot be bought. Zeller, though briefly in <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> government, is virtually unknown engineer. Basic advantage of GRN: it provides an entity to counter rebelsʼ “constitutional government” and it divorces <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> from odious San Isidro old general group. Basic weakness GRN: it is attackable—and is under attack by rebels, who call it “Junta civico militar”—as simply another reactionary business-class “civico” government with military strong-man overlay.</p>
                                <p>To counter all this, Ambassador and I helped arrange, and attachés helped carry out, deportation today of old generals and tomorrow or tonight that of General Wessin y Wessin<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> reported in telegram 1575 from Santo Domingo, May 10, that he and <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName> had met with Wessin the afternoon of May 10. During this meeting Wessin said he would agree to step down now that his pre-conditions had been met—the resignation of seven generals and a Navy Commodore as specified in a May 9 letter he gave <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>. (Ibid.) On May 9 Wessin gave <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> a letter promising his retirement if other generals whom he specifically named would do the same.</note> who, rightly or wrongly, has become symbol of military opposition to constitutionality and aspirations of masses. (We have no desire to destroy DOM armed forces but to restructure it, and we have told <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> he cannot put his stooges in and must deport one his closest friends among military. He has done <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0179"/>latter today.) Believe removal Wessin will on balance strengthen GRNʼs political position. Later on, we can urge, and I believe GRN will carry out, reforms that will benefit people and strengthen GRN.</p>

                                <p>However, the basic political problem remains: the present revolt against the <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> government was, at the outset, almost surely an attempt by <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> leaders and others to reverse the coup against <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> of September 25, 1963. At the time of that coup, the people did not protest. The ideas of social and economic justice which <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> promulgated, however, mobilized latent and legitimate revolutionary aspirations of DOM people, particularly among young, they will not down. They are now being mobilized once more by rebels. GRN might meet this problem by instituting reforms and by divorcing self from discredited politicians and generals. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> can provide strong hand needed now. All this is good program temporarily.</p>
                                <p>Looking to future, however, we should consider these alternatives: (Note—all these possibilities assume no rebel surrender.)

                                <p>My previous experience with commitment to fixed election date or even totally free elections themselves convinces me that such commitment is dangerous in present circumstances. My previous experience with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> makes me equally unenthusiastic about them. Since alternative 3 has never been tried in hemisphere to my knowledge, I find it harder to assess but tentatively suggest that while it would help take <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> off the hook, even high-level <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> commission might find it impossible to form either a broad-based political coalition <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0180"/>or an independent government here, given difficulties and deficiencies, so well known to me, in DOM people, and now so harshly exacerbated by recent events. More plainly, I doubt it would work.</p>
                                <p>Recent holocaust has disrupted if not destroyed old parties and political figures. I would hope new leaders and political groupings might emerge. I therefore recommend we adopt for short run (week or two) alternative 4 above to see if something or somebody turns up. In present unstable situation I suggest we should not get locked into any policy more firm than that. But we should spend that time seeking means of adding non-Communist revolutionary elements to GRN.</p>
                                <p>Of course, if <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> surrenders, I recommend we recognize GRN quickly, first getting whatever commitments from it that we want.</p>

Embassy should put its full resources to exploration of possibility of establishing coalition regime in which <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and possibly one other non-communist member of his group (acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and his group) could be added.<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">In telegram 1626 from Santo Domingo, May 12, <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> reported that negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName>ʼs forces to form a “broadened collective government” had “produced little reason for immediate optimism,” but that moderate <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> member <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Antonio Guzman</persName> had offered to be the “middle man in an effort to form a broad-based Junta.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Dominican Republic, Miscellaneous Reports on the Dominican Situation [2 of 2])</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Purpose of this would be to split <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and hopefully <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> partisans in rebel zone away from extremists. This would be a further step toward establishment of a provisional government which hopefully could gradually consolidate its control over entire country with broad popular support.</p>
                        <p>We recognize this is delicate operation from <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs point of view, but assume from your messages that idea of coalition not unacceptable to him.</p>
                        <p>From <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>ʼs point of view our guess is that more can be gained by appealing to his patriotism and to need for avoiding bloodletting than by any other tactic. However, if additional inducements from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> already known to you would in your opinion be productive this could be mentioned also. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>ʼs group may be waiting for arrival of “Wise Men” (Betancourt, <persName corresp="#p_MML1">Munoz-Marin</persName>/et al). You may inform him that after several days effort we have not been successful in obtaining <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> agreement to this. All of this is a matter for your own on-the-spot discretion.</p>
                        <p>In any case we should work for provisional coalition government which could, after establishing control over entire national territory, return the country to normalcy and eventually, under <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> supervision, guide country to a non-communist constitutional government.</p>
                        <p>One of the issues which apparently has great appeal to Dominicans at this time is constitutionalism. We do not have any clear opinion <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0182"/>about what concessions it would be prudent to make such as proposal 1962 or 1963 constitutions be adopted. This would, of course, be without <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> or his designee as president. A preliminary investigation here suggests that all previous constitutions contain provisions for suspension of constitutional guarantees under circumstances similar to those which exist now. Clearly this would be necessary at this time. We would like your opinion on this possible bargaining position with <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and such others which may occur to you as compatible with our objectives, i.e., prevention of commie takeover and later elections and constitutional regime.</p>
                        <p>You should take this line with <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Committee. We will broach this line of thought to those <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Committee members still in Washington before their departure tomorrow afternoon.</p>

                        <p>President: Now, Bob, are we, are our military people, the brains that we have, meeting and planning and thinking of every step that might be needed to take so we got adequate contingencies? Letʼs assume that <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe</persName> goes out of business tonight and we know that they are building each day and increasing each day and getting stronger each day, and letʼs assume then that our people are fired upon, or weʼre attacked, or weʼre involved some way or we have to get the radio station. How we do it, and what we do, and whether we can go to get an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> flag if we had to have it? Or do we just sit there and let events take place?

                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: I believe we are, Mr. President. We have laid out the plans. They are in considerable detail. The problem is that every one of them is bloody—and very bloody.</p>
                        <p>President: Yeah.</p>

                        <p>President: Yeah. Well, I think the time is going to come before very long when we have to kind of make up our choice to either let <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> have it, or take it. Itʼs—weʼre hoping that he doesnʼt have that much influence, but I rather believe he does.</p>

President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> explained that this meeting did not take place yesterday but would later today.]</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Well, weʼre prepared militarily, Mr. President, every way, I believe, we can be.</p>
                        <p>President: Well, now suppose they—the <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> forces and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and them say there is nothing we can do that we could accept. Then suppose that <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">Palmer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> and our other people, <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>, say we got to have the radio station. Have we thought about what we do and how we do it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Yes. Cy—I donʼt believe heʼs come back yet; he went to the 10 oʼclock meeting this morning<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">Presumably a reference to a meeting of the Dominican Republic Task Force chaired by <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> each morning at the White House. No record of this meeting has been found.</note> and he and I agreed that we should set up a special group that does nothing but work on that radio station. Itʼs, at the moment, a split somewhat between <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and Defense. But this is a small project that we ought to be able to, I think, take over ourselves, and that was my suggestion to Cy and heʼs going to work with the group on it this morning. President: Now, another thing I wanted to call to your attention. I donʼt think there would be any question that you will have some extensive grilling on what warnings you had from the services and from the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>President: And I see from the columns in the <hi rend="italic">New York Post</hi> yesterday, and others, that they are after the invisible government and they are after the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and they want to kind of make a goat out of it like they did with the Bay of Pigs thing. I donʼt know what the facts are, do you?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Well, I know that we had enough warning as far as our military requirements were concerned Mr. President, because, based on, not so much the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> warnings, but just the events that took <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0184"/>place down there, you issued the orders to alert our forces in ample time for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to have them ready to move quickly and close promptly when you wanted them to and you got that.</p>
                        <p>President: Preceding that; preceding the Saturday<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">April 24.</note> take-over, did anybody ever tell you or did you ever envision that this was a very explosive thing?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p>President: That might blow?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: The answer is definitely no, Mr. President. And one of the reasons is that I rely primarily upon the Presidentʼs Intelligence Digest, the daily summary which you go, for my information. I have other sources as well that I dig into. But I use that as the primary checklist. And when I see something dangerous in there, then I go and get more detail on it through the other sources. But that, the Presidentʼs Daily—and checklist—Intelligence Digest, did not carry anything relating to the situation until either the 17th or the 24th, and then it was just an innocuous little item.<note n="4" xml:id="d64fn4">[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</note> So the fact of the matter is that we were not properly alerted through that means for the general political problem. But I differentiate here between the alert required to take effective action politically and the alert required to take action militarily. We got ample warning in what we needed for our effective military action, but we got it not from the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> source, but from the pressure of events down there as reported in the press. And that was why on the Saturday preceding the Wednesday<note n="5" xml:id="d64fn5">April 28.</note>—I donʼt recall the exact circumstances—but I know we talked to you about it and you said, “Go ahead and put whatever you think is required on alert.” We did it on Saturday and Sunday. And the result was, when we had to move Wednesday, we moved within a matter of—we closed within four hours after you issued the order. So militarily we werenʼt handicapped. Politically, frankly, I think we were very seriously handicapped by lack of notice.</p>
                        <p>President: Well, now, donʼt you think thatʼs something that you and <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> and I ought to talk about pretty soon—what did happen there, and letʼs get it brought up to date and letʼs see what <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> knew, if he knew anything before Saturday. Because we are going to have to tell them what we know, if anything.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>President: I have refused to make anybody a goat. And I have said that we held back to the last moment. <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> said, “I will not recommend troops at this point, although they are firing on the Embassy.” <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0185"/>But within a couple of hours, he said, “I got to have them to preserve life,” and we did it.

                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Well, either on the phone, or about 7 when you had the Congressional leaders there.<note n="8" xml:id="d64fn8">See <ref target="#d35">Document 35</ref>.</note>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: And I think he did it at that meeting.</p>
                        <p>President: Uh, huh. So the important thing is for me to see if I talked to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> before that meeting.</p>

                        <p>President: Mac says it doesnʼt say anything except that thereʼs some problems.</p>

                        <p>President: Now, if we donʼt have a political solution to this thing and we canʼt get any agreement from <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName>ʼs people, how long can we wait until he gets that powerful and he gets that sentiment up and he gets where he gets aid from <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and maybe from foreign sources before we clean up that city?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Well, Mr. President, I think weʼve got to get a political situation.</p>
                        <p>President: Well.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: I canʼt answer your question how long we can wait; but we can wait another 24 or 48 hours.</p>
                        <p>President: Oh, yeah, we know we got to do that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: And in that period, we just have to move ahead. Itʼs not reducing our military capability to take over those rebels by waiting 24, 48, 72 hours.</p>
                        <p>President: I believe everyday you lose it. I believe you lose—I donʼt think you lose any of your capab—any of your strength, but I think they get a good deal stronger.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Well, maybe.</p>
                        <p>President: They are going back to work now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Well, I think they get stronger politically, Mr. President, but militarily, they arenʼt getting much stronger, and therefore.</p>
                        <p>President: Well, do we know that? Do we know they arenʼt shipping them stuff?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Well, we have a pretty fair check. I canʼt say that they are not getting any guns, but I can say they are not getting many. And I donʼt believe that the relative military balance is shifting very much day by day. Itʼs moving a little bit in there.</p>
                        <p>President: Should we move down there and suggest to them again—the suggestion somebody made yesterday—to try and buy up their arms?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: No, I think that is unimportant at this point.</p>
                        <p>President: All right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: But I do think we ought to keep pushing on buying <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> and keep pushing on <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. We just have to get a political situation here.</p>
                        <p>President: Well, if they are controlled by the Castroites, they are not going to give it to you.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: I donʼt think they are. How the hell can 58 people control them when theyʼve got several hundred. I just donʼt believe the story that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> are controlled by the Castroites. I donʼt mean to say they arenʼt influenced, Mr. President, not at all. But I donʼt believe that 58 people—or 200 people for that matter—can militarily control, physically control, this other bunch.</p>

                        <p>At 4:05 p.m. on May 12, 1965, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> telephoned <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> and recounted the chronology of meetings on the Dominican Republic leading up to the decision to land U.S. Marines. <persName>Johnson</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> if he had been informed of the intensifying problem in the Dominican Republic prior to his swearing-in as the new <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Director and <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> replied, “yes.” The President asked if <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, and others were surprised by the Dominican crisis and <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> responded, “No, sir.” The President asked, “They knew this?” <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> replied, “Yes, sir. They were alerting the entire intelligence community by established means of this.” President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said, “Now if this was that explosive, and if they knew it, we have got to set up a better means of notifying me.” <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> said, “I agree.” President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said there needed to be “a better means of interpreting to me or preparing me for [them] because quite frankly I donʼt want to blame anybody, I want to take the blame, Iʼm big enough and broad enough and man enough to take anything, but I sure do want to know it.” <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> said he agreed and would work to find a solution to this problem. Toward the end of the conversation President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> for a complete chronology of intelligence on the Dominican Republic prior to U.S. intervention. <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> replied that such a document (see <ref target="#d64fn4">footnote 4, Document 64</ref>) had just been delivered to <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName>. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said he would review it.

                        <p>In a May 12 memorandum to the President received at 6:05 p.m., <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> recounted that he had met earlier in the day with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Deputy Director of Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> Cline who was informed of the Presidentʼs <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0188"/>dissatisfaction with the current system of getting information to him. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> and Cline agreed to try a new method. The President would receive “all really good” intelligence by a faster ticker which would be delivered to him via his secretaryʼs office. In addition, twice a day the President would receive a more general assessment, once in his evening checklist and again in a morning summary ready at 7:30 a.m. in the Situation Room.

                                    <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> telephoned <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName> on May 13 at 6:30 p.m. to finalize plans for the transportation of the two Dominican military officers from Puerto Rico to Santo Domingo, and discuss arrangements once they arrived. (Ibid., Recording of telephone conversation between <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName>, Tape F65.24, Side A, PNO 3)</note> From these conversations, it emerged that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> was sending a Colonel <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Colonel Caamano</persName>, hopefully leading to his accepting <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs solution to the political problem. The President was clearly doubtful that <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Colonel Caamano</persName> would agree to quit. Nevertheless, if <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Colonel Caamano</persName> does agree, then <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would talk with <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> in an effort to persuade him to assume the presidency, after proper support from the Dominican Congress.

                            <p>Concerning active Communists and Trujillistas, it is agreed that they present the problem for democratic government in the Dominican Republic and that effective measures must be taken by the <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0193"/>constitutional government to protect the Dominican people from their subversive activities. These measures will involve their separation from the Dominican community. They may take the form of their internment in some isolated area under Dominican jurisdiction or their departure from the island, identification of such persons to be effective promptly by mutual consultation, and prompt action will follow as aforesaid.</p>

                        <p rend="center">THE SITUATION IN THE INTERIOR OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</p>
                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>The calm which has generally prevailed in the Dominican countryside may be misleading. Under the surface there is a good deal of popular support for the <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> movement and there is little positive support for the <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> Government of National Reconstruction. At the same time, lack of food or its high cost and the general economic dislocation are stimulating discontent.</p>
                        <p>This situation is made to order for radical agitations, and it is clear that both pro-<persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and Communist elements in the rebel movement are attempting to exploit it, particularly through inflammatory broadcasts over Radio Santo Domingo. Disturbances have already occurred in some localities, most significantly in the relatively conservative city of Santiago on 13 May. The chances of growing unrest, confusion, and rebel gains in the interior are almost certain to increase if the political stalemate is prolonged in Santo Domingo.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Developments in the provinces of the Dominican Republic have normally been dominated by what is going on in the capital city. Santo Domingo is not only the political, military, and financial center of the country; it is also the hub of the countryʼs commercial, transportation, and communication systems. It is the Dominican industrial center. All major industries, except for chocolate manufacturing and mining, are <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0194"/>based in the capital.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">In the city are food processing plants, the countryʼs only cement plant, the largest flour mill, a shipyard, a foundry, a brewery, a distillery, and plants producing nails, vegetable oils, textiles, batteries, fertilizers, asbestos products, shoes, soap, and explosives. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Even more important is the fact that Santo Domingo is the location of the countryʼs major wholesale houses, which provide domestic and imported goods to local merchants all over the country. Well over ten percent of the Dominican population lives in the capital.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Political and military decisions reached in the capital have historically been accepted in the countryside. Most Dominicans want to be on the winning side. During the crucial days of the insurrection prior to the landing of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military forces, it was apparent that the bulk of the populace in the interior was simply waiting for an outcome in the capital before joining forces with the winner. There is little doubt that if the rebel forces in the capital had won, most of the military commands throughout the provinces, as well as the provincial and local government bodies, would have swung to the rebel side. A few ranking military officers would have recognized that a rebel victory signified the end of their careers, and these officers might have tried to resist, but it is more likely that they would have run away. The conservative business class in the Cibao area would have been opposed to the rebellion, but its reaction probably would have been ineffectual and passive.</item>

                            <item>What actually happened after the landing of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces was that the wavering and waiting Dominican military commands in the interior suddenly stiffened and became “loyalist.” They evidently believed that the coming of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops had significantly reduced the chances of a rebel victory. It must be assumed, however, that “loyalist” control in the interior at present is only as secure as it is in the capital. If the situation in the capital should shift toward some other group, those now exercising control in the countryside would probably follow suit.</item>

                            <item>There is one element in the present political-psychological situation which could cause some shift from the traditional pattern. This new element is that <hi rend="italic">potential</hi> rebel strength—in the interior as well as in the capital—is probably much greater than is apparent on the surface. There is little doubt that the <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> government does represent to many people throughout the country the forces of “constitutionalism” and of general revulsion against the old “establishment.” In this sense, there are elements of a genuine popular revolution in the <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> movement.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>In addition, <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> personally has shown some of the qualities of a charismatic leader. The <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> Government of National <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0195"/>Reconstruction, on the other hand, has as yet no base of public support and, where it is respected, it is respected as the source of authority and police control. The <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> government is, rightly or wrongly, regarded by many Dominicans as the defender of the discredited military establishment and of the conservative economic oligarchy.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>The issue of Communism in the <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> government is not well understood by most Dominicans. Reports from a number of interior towns during the course of the insurrection reveal that the young people throughout the countryside were the ones most ready to commit themselves to the rebel cause. Groups of young men left their home towns on the first two days of the insurrection and traveled toward Santo Domingo to fight for the rebels. Many of these youths subsequently drifted back home during the first week of May. They remain an as yet unorganized but potential source of active rebel support in many towns throughout the country. There were 200 such young men in the town of Santiago Rodriguez alone who left for the capital.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Given the degree of Communist influence which is believed to exist in the rebel movement, the potential for Communist exploitation of the existing pro-rebel sentiment in the countryside and for Communist organizational efforts must be regarded as considerable.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>There are reports, from clandestine sources in or close to extremist groups, of Communist preparations to organize guerrilla warfare in the interior. Communists are stockpiling weapons and planning to exploit popular sentiments, using the customary nationalistic and reformist slogans to enlist the militant non-Communist revolutionaries. These reports must be taken seriously.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>The Communists have a fertile field. It is quite possible, over the coming months, that they may succeed in developing a broadly-supported paramilitary capability at certain points in the interior. Such an effort would threaten to complete the job of stealing the revolution from its former moderate leaders. The result might become effective pressure from the countryside on the city—a reversal of the traditional pattern, but the identical pattern which did, in fact, occur in Cuba in 1958 and 1959.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>At the same time, discontent has been stimulated by the economic disruption throughout the country caused by the rebel control of most important portions of the capital city. Santo Domingo is now unable to supply the goods needed to maintain the local economies. This condition is exacerbating the already chronic unemployment problem in many towns and cities. Small industries have been forced to close down because they have received no raw materials from Santo Domingo. The commercial banking system, headquartered in the capital is inoperative throughout the country and there is little money to pay the workers who do have jobs. The traditionally passive <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0196"/>campesinos are bringing some locally produced foods into the towns and cities, but it is not enough.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>Worse yet—because of its serious social and political implications—is the fact that local Dominican merchants—who seem to have even less social awareness than the usual Latin Americans in this class, have raised their prices to levels at which the poor in some areas cannot obtain food even though supplies exist in local stores and warehouses. That this is an explosive problem is demonstrated by the food riots that have taken place this week in almost every location where charitable organizations have set up free food distribution centers. The extremists are being handed a perfect issue with which to rouse public hatred against the middle class.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>Against this background, the propaganda which the rebel government has been able to broadcast throughout the country over the transmitters of Radio Santo Domingo, at least through 12 May, can only serve to arouse more public discontent and more support for the rebel cause.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>A possible foretaste of things to come occurred in Santiago on 12 May when Communist and other pro-rebel elements tried to organize a demonstration in a city park. In this case, the local military authorities reacted vigorously in breaking up the small groups which attempted to demonstrate, and one demonstrator was shot when he threw rocks at the police. On the same day members of the medical and law associations in Santiago were canvassing for signatures for a petition against the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military intervention.</item>
                            <label>14.</label>
                            <item>It is apparent that the longer the political stalemate continues in Santo Domingo, the greater the chances of disturbances and pro-rebel gains in the interior. Also, as the impasse is prolonged, more of the relatively moderate rebels or rebel sympathizers are likely to adopt increasingly extremist attitudes.</item>
                            <label>15.</label>
                            <item>The one possible development which could significantly undercut extremist potential in the countryside, as well as in the capital city, would be the establishment in Santo Domingo of a government which is more representative of popular aspirations for revolutionary change, less burdened by the ineffective and outmoded traditional Dominican military establishment, not beholden to the old economic oligarchy, and not perverted by Communist influence. The formation of such a government is complicated by the short supply of qualified leaders who can fill the bill.</item>

                            <item>This meeting consisted of a two and a half hour discussion of a variety of matters affecting United States Government policy toward the Dominican Republic.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>At the start, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> indicated that he had heard from Mr. Davidson and that the approach to <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> had gone a hundred percent.<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">Fortas telephoned President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at 2:45 p.m. on May 14 to inform him that “the entire plan has been accepted.” They also discussed the next step in the plan, which was to locate <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>. (Ibid., Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName>, Tape F65.25, Side A, PNO 1 and 2)</note> In other words, <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> had accepted the proposition conveyed to him by the two Colonels representing <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> also noted that the search was on to locate <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>. At about 1930, another call came from Mr. Davidson to the President in which Mr. Davidson stated that <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> had agreed to serve as president of a provisional government.<note n="3" xml:id="d69fn3">Fortas telephoned President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at 7:29 p.m. on May 14 to tell him <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> had agreed to accept the position. <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName> suggested that a “professional,” such as <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> be sent to San Juan to meet with <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked what <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> would do, and furthermore, why was it necessary for him to go to San Juan since <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName> was as “good of a man as Iʼve got” down there. <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName> thought it was essential for someone else to “talk to the future number one man, … to do a belly-to-belly understanding of everything.” <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName> reasoned, “it would be better to have someone who will have a continuing role establish the relationship” since as an intermediary he would be leaving the scene eventually. (Ibid., Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName>, Tape F65.25, Side A, PNO 4, and Side B, PNO 1)</note> It was further indicated that <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> was proceeding to San Juan for the purpose of meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. At this juncture, there ensued <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0198"/>considerable discussion of which United States Government official should proceed to San Juan, to meet with <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>, and to reenforce on the part of the United States how <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> was to handle the problem of Communists in the Dominican Republic. The President finally decided, after considering <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, to have <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> fly to San Isidro first for conversations with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>, then proceed to San Juan, probably on 15 May, for the desired talk with <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>. It was further agreed that <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy Crockett</persName> would go to New York for a private and unofficial conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in order to insure that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would play ball if and when he received a telephone call from <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. It was emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was not to let on that the United States Government had approached him since <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has indicated that he is very touchy on the point of having this matter handled by himself only.</item>

                            <item>One part of the meeting dealt with the deteriorating economic situation in the Dominican Republic. There was considerable discussion of this problem, and it was finally decided to send <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SAM1">Solomon</persName>, and a team of twenty-odd economy experts to Santo Domingo in an effort to get the economy of the country moving again.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The President was most anxious to have Davidson persuade <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> that Radio Santo Domingo should stop its inflammatory broadcasts. He indicated that we were prepared to have the Loyalists cease their incendiary statements if Radio Santo Domingo would do the same.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> was asked to organize sabotage teams from the Special Forces to take out the radio transmitters of Radio Santo Domingo if this eventuality appeared necessary.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>There was a lengthy discussion of actions to be taken if the Davidson mission were to fail. There was acrimonious argument about a <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> proposal to pull United States troops across the bridge to San Isidro and permit the city of Santo Domingo to become a political and economic whole. There was opposition to this suggestion from others present. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> advocated having United States troops clean out the northern section of Santo Domingo. There was also reluctance to accept this recommendation. In addition, the role of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in the present and future of the Dominican Republic was canvassed in depth.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The problem in the countryside was much discussed, but it soon became related to what one should do about Santo Domingo since that city is the political and economic heart of the country.</item>

                            <item>During the meeting, the President spoke on the telephone with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">J. Edgar Hoover</persName>.

                        <p>I have not been in direct contact with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> except on irregular occasions. In order to arrange a secret meeting, it was therefore necessary to work through my intermediary of the last few months, Washington lobbyist Irving Davidson.<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">A pseudonym used by <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName>.</note> There was no other way of going about this, particularly in the time frame called for by my action assignment, since I do not have Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs home address nor know how he can be reached except through Davidson.</p>
                        <p>On May 14 I called Davidson at home at 8:30 p.m. and told him that I wanted to arrange a secret meeting with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> for that same evening. Davidson reminded me that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is always surrounded by people like Enrique Garcia and other hangers-on. If a truly secret meeting was to be carried out, we would have to make some unusual arrangements. After some discussion, Davidson and I agreed on the following plan:

                                <item>Davidson would contact <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in New York by telephone and tell <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> that a mutual friend (of Davidsonʼs and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs) wished to come to New York to see <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> that evening;</item>
                                <label>2)</label>
                                <item>That the nature of the discussion to be undertaken would be such that it would be necessary for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to meet with Davidson and the mutual friend at some place other than <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs headquarters;</item>
                                <label>3)</label>
                                <item>To this end Davidson would suggest to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> that he wait for Davidson and “the mutual friend” in the lobby of the Regency Hotel at 11:45 p.m. May 14;</item>
                                <label>4)</label>
                                <item>If <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was willing to go ahead on this basis and would not insist on the “mutual friend” being identified, the deal was on;</item>
                                <label>5)</label>
                                <item>Davidson and <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> would take the 10:00 p.m. Eastern Airlines shuttle to New York to arrive at the Regency Hotel no later than 11:30.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Davidson called back very shortly to inform me that he had been able to make arrangements with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in strict accordance with the terms on which agreement had been reached, as outlined above.</p>
                        <p>Davidson was not sure, but gathered from a comment <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> made during their conversation, that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> probably thought the <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0201"/>“mutual friend” who was coming was General Gleason. In any event, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> did not question the arrangement but readily agreed to it.</p>
                        <p>I met Davidson just in time to catch the 10:00 p.m. Eastern shuttle to New York and we worked out a scenario for the meeting during the course of the flight. We both agreed that the talk should be informal and leisurely, in keeping with all of the earlier meetings I have had with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. We also agreed that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> should be suitably impressed by the surroundings in which the meeting would take place. To this end we arranged for a rather elaborate suite of rooms at the Regency.</p>
                        <p>Davidson and I made it to the Regency before <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> turned up and I went immediately to the suite we had reserved (room 1061). Davidson waited in the lobby for <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to make sure that he had, in fact, come to the meeting alone before bringing him up to see me. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and Davidson joined me at about midnight.</p>
                        <p>After an exchange of the traditional formalities which the proprieties require in meeting with a Latin American and particularly one who has been a president of a country, I opened the conversation by apologizing to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> for having asked him to come to me. I told him that I regretted very much the necessity of arranging the meeting in this manner since it would have been much more proper and respectful on my part to come to see him at his own headquarters. I asked that he forgive this impropriety and that he understand that I suggested we meet in this manner only because I felt it would be dangerous for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> for me to come to his headquarters at this time and in the current circumstances.</p>
                        <p>To prepare the way for getting into the substantive stage of our conversation, I asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> if he would be kind enough to: a) give me his views on the current situation as it has evolved in the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> over recent weeks and b) outline to me any program which he felt might offer promise of contributing to the solution of the current political impasse there. I told him that I and the people with whom I work have a great deal of respect for him as a statesman and that we felt it would be very much to our advantage to have his thoughts on these and any other points he might like to cover. I stressed at this point and on various other occasions during the course of the conversation the importance which I attached to our meeting and the substance of our discussion being held in complete confidence between only the two of us. He not only agreed, but said that he, too, felt this would be in everyoneʼs interest.</p>
                        <p>As Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is an intellectual and a gentleman, productive talks with him must be carried out with dignity and tact. The introductory exercise which I have just described took the better part of 45 minutes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> opened his presentation by recalling his announcement earlier this week to the effect that he and his people would cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> in every way in order to restore tranquility in <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0202"/>the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss>. He said that the first indispensable step must be formation of some sort of national coalition which can command respect and qualify for recognition. While Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and his group would be willing to work with <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and/or <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> to this end, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was afraid that neither <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> could organize a government which would command support in the country as a whole.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> that while we wished to avoid making judgments on any political figures or groupings in the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss>, except the communists with whom we could not work under any circumstances, I felt his assessment of both the <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> group and the <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> group was quite close to our own. At the same time, I pointed out that Dominican figures of prestige who possess real leadership potential have been extremely reluctant to take any active part in Dominican politics. I asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> if he thought there was any realistic prospect for bringing men of stature, good faith, and high motivation together in this hour of great trial for his country.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> felt that prospects for achieving this were probably better now than at any time in the past. He pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> stands on the edge of a precipice and faces the dire prospect of ceasing to be an independent nation. Unless Dominicans can find some way of working together in governing their own country, they will be governed by someone else, such as the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MML1">Muñoz Marin</persName>, Betancourt, or perhaps even as a UN trusteeship. He therefore felt that the point has been reached when it would be impossible for Dominicans of stature to refuse a call to serve their country.</p>
                        <p>I responded that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs views were most heartwarming to me. I asked him if he had any particular people in mind who might be willing to come forward in the circumstances he has just described.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> said there were many, ticking off a list of perhaps a half-dozen names, none of which were very inspiring as far as I am concerned. I consequently made no comment on the names but sought to turn the discussion in another direction.</p>
                        <p>I told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> that I was sure he understood the great price the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had paid in reaching its decision to land <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces on Dominican soil. I “guessed” that it was probably the hardest decision with which this country has ever been faced in its dealings with Latin America. I told him that one of our primary objectives is to help promote, by all means at our disposal, the creation of a stable and prosperous Dominican Republic so that we may withdraw our forces at the very earliest possible date.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> interrupted at this point to say that while he, too, was heart-sick over the fact of his countryʼs occupation, he nonetheless recognized that there had been no alternative to the landing of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops under the circumstances. He felt that it would be a mistake for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0203"/>to withdraw its forces prematurely as the communists would surely gain control of the country if we did. Further, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> felt that the time has now come for a complete restructuring of the Dominican armed forces. Once this has been accomplished, then the time will have come for a gradual withdrawal of foreign forces.</p>
                        <p>In response to my query, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> outlined his views on the most desirable form that a restructured Dominican armed force might take. His ideas were so close to those we have developed in the <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> Committee meetings that I have wondered at one stage whether someone might not have already briefed him about what we have in mind. Consequently, I reacted to his proposal only to the extent of nodding my head affirmatively as he outlined it. At the end of his presentation I told him that it seemed to me this was something for Dominicans themselves to work out but I was sure the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> could count on the full cooperation and support of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> if, in fact, events should evolve in the way he had just outlined.</p>
                        <p>At this point, I got down to the business of carrying out the remainder of my assignment. I told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> that:

                                <item>I sincerely regretted finding myself in the position of asking so much of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> while I was limited by my instructions to tell him so little;</item>

                                <item>Without naming any names, I said I was sure he would understand how difficult it was to deal with some of the individuals who must be involved in any meaningful solution. I again underscored the delicacy of this entire operation from that standpoint.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>At this point, I asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> if he felt we had understood each other, despite the elliptical nature of our conversation. If not, did he have any questions to ask?</p>
                        <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0204"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> said that he felt there was a clear understanding between us and that he had no doubts as to the meaning of my various comments and suggestions nor, for that matter, my failure to react to some of his comments and suggestions. He said that the really serious problem from his standpoint was a basic one for which he saw no solution. He protested that he is a man without ambition and that he is beginning to feel the weight of his years (salt to taste).</p>
                        <p>I took this up immediately by repeating my earlier statements, emphasizing the Dominican Republicʼs great need at this time for the help and support of its leading statesmen. I said that for my own part, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> headed that list. I was confident he would not fail his country in this hour of need despite the heavy price I realized he would have to pay in again taking up an active role in Dominican politics.</p>
                        <p>I really think Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> swallowed this one hook, line and sinker. At least tears came into his eyes.</p>

                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> opened the meeting by thanking the Dominican officers for their courtesy in attending. It was necessary, if inconvenient, to assemble at San Isidro in order to avoid publicity and potentially damaging speculation in the press.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> explained that he had been sent to the Dominican Republic by the President of the United States and was speaking for the President. A solution to the Dominican conflict must be found quickly. It was particularly urgent to get the Dominican economy going again. In this context, the Dominican officers were surely aware that basic Communist tactics aimed at bringing the economy of a target country to a standstill so as to promote general chaos and suffering.</p>
                        <p>If order could not be restored rapidly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> continued, fighting might break out in the provinces. The United States would then <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0209"/>probably have to use force to a much greater degree and a full-scale occupation could result. Faced with this problem, the United States Government had been giving careful and continuing study to various means of ending the fighting. It was recognized that the use of force to clear the rebels from Santo Domingo might ultimately be necessary. However, the United States Government was not prepared to consider this alternative except as a last resort. The rebel forces included many well-intentioned youngsters who had been tricked by the extremists. The Communists were now in the background while these innocents played an increasingly important role. The shedding of their blood would be a tragedy.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said, the United States Government had come to the conclusion that the Dominican people were tired of government by oligarchy, unjustified privileges for the few and general corruption. They wanted equality, reforms and constitutionality. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, for himself and for all of his government, had made United States support for these aspirations absolutely clear. At the same time, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> commented, the Dominican officers should have no misapprehensions regarding the anti-Communist commitment of the United States Government. He personally could speak with full authority and excellent credentials on this point, having been subjected to incessant attack by <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and all his supporters.</p>
                        <p>Rivera Caminero spoke at this juncture, first summarizing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>ʼs remarks as he understood them and then expressing doubts as to the validity of the argument against using military action to end the rebellion. It was his opinion that such action offered the most rapid and practical way to a solution.</p>
                        <p>In responding, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> pointed out that the creation of martyrs was a basic element of Marxist-Leninist tactics in any conflict situation. He further explained that complicated international problems made it essential to search for a peaceful solution. Obtaining a bare two-thirds vote in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> for the concept of an Inter-American force had been a difficult struggle. The intervention had been attacked heavily in the United Nations, and the United States and its allies were hard put there to defend the right of the hemisphere to deal with its own affairs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> then turned to specifics. In view of these various considerations, the United States Government had decided that the best solution lay with the formation of a government of national unity. Unofficial contacts with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> had led to a concrete proposal for such a government to be headed by <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Antonio Guzman</persName>. No firm agreement had yet been reached, but it now appeared close. The patriotic support of the Armed Forces would be needed and the United States Government expected that support to be forthcoming in the best interests of the Dominican Republic and the hemisphere.</p>
                        <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0210"/>
                        <p>There were to be no reprisals or vengeance, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> continued. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would have the responsibility of controlling <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> and the rebels. The Communists were to be eliminated from the political life of the nation—this being a firm condition for United States support of the proposal. For their part, the Armed Forces would accept and support the new government in return for the recognition of the principle of the integrity of the Armed Forces. The right of the military to exist as an integral institution with a voice in the future of the nation was to be clearly established with the formation of the new government. As added insurance, it had been agreed that a man specifically acceptable to the Armed Forces would be chosen for a Cabinet or sub-Cabinet position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> emphasized that under this formula the Armed Forces would be in a solid position to defend the security of the nation. The United States would assist in this task, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> already having made clear his determination to prevent the Dominican Republic from falling to communism whatever the cost. The United States would also be prepared to help the Armed Forces to reform and modernize. The Dominican Navy obviously needed patrol boats, not overage destroyers; the Army required mobile units with modern arms, not masses of untrained men; in general, it was time for the Dominican Armed Forces to reorient toward professionalism and the modern age. Perhaps training under Inter-American auspices could be arranged.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the question of the proposed new government, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> described <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Antonio Guzman</persName> as a moderate, honorable and stable man who could give the country responsible leadership. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> had promised to participate, perhaps not personally, but at least through one or more representatives in the Cabinet. This would give the new government balance and help insure its commitment to national unity.</p>
                        <p>General De Los Santos asked if the proposal meant reinstatement of the Constitution of 1963. Commodore Rivera described that Constitution as “atheistic” and said any new government that might be formed should write its own constitution.</p>
                        <p>In reply, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> observed that politics is always the art of the possible. The 1963 Constitution was obviously not ideal but its acceptance seemed to offer the only way to pacify and unite the country. In any case, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> continued, it was difficult to believe that this question had very great importance. Various methods would be available to change the Constitution if that proved necessary. The Dominican officers should turn their attention to fundamental issues. The proposal dealt satisfactorily with these: the Armed Forces would be preserved; the country would have a moderate president and a balanced Cabinet; the way would be open to maintain the Inter-American force <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0211"/>until peace could be assured; a beginning would be made on the crucial task of economic development; and the means would be at hand to deal intelligently with the Communist threat.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> also pointed out that what was actually under discussion was a provisional government of approximately 17 months duration. Under the 1963 Constitution, elections would then be held. The <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> would supervise these elections, making certain they were truly free. There were strong indications that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> could expect to do very well indeed in honest elections.</p>
                        <p>In addition, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> emphasized, the Dominican officers must realize that national unity was essential. He well understood the profound hatreds caused by the conflict, knowledge of his own familyʼs experiences in the American Civil War having prepared him for such understanding. He also understood, however, that the country could only go forward if hatreds were laid aside. As part of the process of creating national unity, the Armed Forces would have to accept the reincorporation of the rebel officers and men. In the end, this would be the least painful course they could adopt. Finally, the reunited Armed Forces would have to change their ways. The goal must be a respected, honorable institution enjoying the support of the people and dedicated to the role of guardians of the nation. When this goal was achieved, the Armed Forces could count on the support of the United States, not before.</p>
                        <p>Commodore Rivera said he could not accept <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> back because <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> had sacked his house. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> observed that vengeance should be avoided and the law applied in cases of this kind. He also stressed that <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> would not be in the new government. In response to a question from De Los Santos regarding the political composition of the government, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that it was not yet known in detail which specific parties and men would participate. The important thing was to have a broad government of national unity. General De Los Santos remarked that the Communists always call for governments of national unity. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> again explained that the establishment of the government was conditioned on the removal of the Communists from the political arena.</p>
                        <p>He also reiterated the absolute commitment of the United States to prevent a Communist takeover in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican officers should attempt to understand that their best guarantee in this regard was provided by the determination of the United States to protect its own national interests. A Communist victory in the Dominican Republic would have doubled the potential capacity of the Soviets to kill North Americans. It was not a question of ideology but of security against Sino-Soviet aggression.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the problem of the leadership of the Armed Forces under the new government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> mentioned that <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0212"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> had suggested a <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Colonel</persName>
                            <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> The former went on to remark that it was none of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs business who headed the Armed Forces, while the latter expressed the opinion that the Armed Forces should select their own chief. The Dominican officers all agreed with this point of view. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> replied that Corominas had only been a suggestion and observed that there could be no objection to the Armed Forces coming up with their own man, always providing he was apolitical, respected, honorable and professional.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> then returned to his thesis that the Dominican officers should concern themselves with fundamentals. The proposal he was advancing offered the Dominican Republic a chance to return to security and peace. The integrity of the Armed Forces would be preserved and the Communist threat would be eliminated. It would be well to think back to the immediate past—to how the country arrived at this crossroads. The revolt created a vacuum; Communists—armed Communists—filled that vacuum. For a time they were the only real organized force. In order to meet this danger, the United States had taken and was continuing to take great risks. It would be a disgrace for the Armed Forces and Dominicans in general if the United States was forced to extend its intervention. The Dominican officers understandably found it difficult to make concessions but under the circumstances they must.</p>
                        <p>General De Los Santos asserted that the 1963 Constitution could not be accepted because its reinstatement would force all decent Dominicans as good Catholics to emigrate. Commodore Rivera added that to accept the 1963 Constitution was to accept the government of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>, an impossibility. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> suggested that acceptance could be provisional. If persecution of Catholics resulted, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and his supporters would be put on the defensive and corrective action could be taken. He once more pointed out that elections would be coming in 17 months and that there was reason to believe the majority would not vote for <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. The latter claimed to be the voice of the people. Why not let him try to prove it? In addition, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> had made the 1963 Constitution a symbol. Why not accept this symbol—only a symbol—in order to end the fighting?</p>
                        <p>At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> repeated his explanation of the international difficulties posed by the Dominican crisis. He described in detail the difficult situation in the United Nations where the United States had to counter attempts by the Soviet Union to mix in the Dominican affair. The Dominican officers should bear in mind these important factors, realizing that the fight against communism is not just a narrow, national struggle.</p>
                        <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0213"/>
                        <p>General Martinez Arana responded with the observation that he had nothing personal against <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> but [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>, in his opinion, was an honorable man and might be acceptable if he were not under the influence of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> observed that the United States would have considerable influence with the new government and, again, that elections would be coming, with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs chances to win distinctly poor. It was important to separate <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> from the Communists. The establishment of a new government under <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Antonio Guzman</persName> would accomplish that purpose. General De Los Santos objected that the Communists would somehow get into and exploit the elections. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> assured him this would not be possible, emphasizing again that the United States had just as much interest in preventing such a development as did the Dominican military.</p>
                        <p>He further urged De Los Santos and the others to think in flexible terms. Why could not they be as clever as the Communists in protecting their long-term interests? Here was an opportunity to take the initiative for once. Nothing would be frozen. On the contrary, acceptance of the proposal would bring a great opportunity to work for truly basic solutions to the countryʼs problems.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> asked, what were the alternatives? The Dominican Armed Forces did not have the capacity to restore order by themselves. The general situation was increasingly serious. Every hour lost was crucial to the future of the country. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> at this point added his personal plea. Obviously, given the vilification to which he had been subjected by the rebels, the proposal was difficult for him, just as it was for the Dominican officers. Nevertheless, he recognized as they should that peace must be restored and a beginning made on the task of reunifying the country.</p>
                        <p>General De los Santos said he still could not understand why it was necessary to accept the 1963 Constitution. To do so would put the Armed Forces in an “undignified position.” The Armed Forces had deposed <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. Giving in now on the question of the Constitution would leave them “naked” and logically lead to the dismemberment of the Armed Forces. Commodore Rivera added his opinion that to accept the 1963 Constitution would be the equivalent of declaring the cause for which he and his comrades had fought to be unjust—that the rebels had been right. Also, it was well known that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> was an enemy of the Armed Forces and that the Communists were behind the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>. It was the opinion of Commodore Rivera that the best political party was the Union Civica Nacional.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> responded that he still held the view that the constitutional question meant very little. The real cause, the real mission—both of the Armed Forces and the United States—was to preserve the Dominican Republic from communism. What he proposed would serve <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0214"/>that cause. The Dominican officers should look to the future, keep their people together, keep the chance to give the country a decent future. Otherwise, all might end in chaos and hatred—hatred for the military and for the United States. Now was the time to act.</p>
                        <p>General De los Santos predicted that the proposed new government could only last three months and that by the time it reached its end he and his colleagues would have been eliminated. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> conceded that this might happen and that there were, in the very nature of the difficult Dominican situation, possibilities for other unfavorable developments.</p>
                        <p>Commodore Jimenez then proposed that he and his fellow officers withhold judgment until more specific details of the proposal were available, including the names of those who were to serve in the government. He said the Dominican officers recognized the sacrifices made by the United States and were deeply grateful. He felt it necessary, nevertheless, to point out that the formula proposed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> posed a number of difficult problems. The political parties not involved would resist the formation of a <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> government, as would many democrats and non-Communists in general.</p>
                        <p>There was agreement among the Dominican officers that Commodore Jimenez was correct in urging delay in reaching a final decision until more detailed discussions could be held. At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> asked to speak privately with the officers, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

                        <p>68. May 65. For White House from <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VJH1">Vaughn</persName>. For Acting Secretary of State<note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">On May 15 <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was in Vienna to commemorate the Tenth Anniversary of the Austrian State Treaty. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> was Acting Secretary.</note> (RUEHC). This afternoon and this evening <persName corresp="#p_VJH1">Vaughn</persName>, <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0215"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHW1">Shlaudeman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> had three principal conversations. First with the Secretary of State for Armed Forces Rivera Caminero, Chief of Staff of Air Force de Los Santos Cespedes, Chief of Staff of Navy Emilio Jimenez, and Chief of Staff of Army Jacinto Martinez. In two hour discussion we outlined our views of current situation and expressed opinion. This was moment for government of national unity which would hold office for 17 months period preceding next elections. We said we are exploring with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and other political leaders possibility of a coalition but made clear we did not yet have firm agreement. The four expressed opposition to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> or to 1963 constitution. Objected to reintegration of or any other accommodation with rebel officers. Specifically rejected Corominas. Said he was former Ramfis Trujilloʼs chauffeur with fourth grade education. Our feeling is that all four are opposed to proposed coalition but will ultimately go along. Question is whether they will really try to control their officers in the three services and if they do, whether they can succeed in bringing armed forces along.</p>
                        <p>Personal hatreds obviously run very deep. These officers are, in opinion of Embassy, cream of the crop and the only ones among top officers willing with <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> to take personal risks to actively oppose rebel movement.</p>
                        <p>We did not see Wessin, whose staff said he was fighting, but who we are informed by Rivera was hiding from us. We do not believe we should overestimate Wessinʼs strength as he has lost stature as a result of his vacilating timidity and indecision. Wessin is described as having said he would prefer to be pushed out rather than voluntarily resign and believe it probable that this could be accomplished if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Imbert made good impression. <persName corresp="#p_SHW1">Shlaudeman</persName> says that whatever his faults—and they are considerable—he is man that has never double-crossed us. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> strongly expressed his disappointment. He said that he had no political ambition (probably only partially true) and would have stepped down yesterday morning, if he had been told. Said his forces had taken three hundred and forty prisoners; made considerable advance north of <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> yesterday and today and inflicted numerous casualties. Said this cut his ties with all anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> elements and left him in isolated and exposed position. Said he had spoken to Embassy of possibility of resigning before and would do so at any time. Said occupation by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops was preferable to Commie take over, that if his loyal forces suffer another serious setback they would cease to exist as effective fighting unit and we would then be faced with necessity of occupying entire country for many months to come. Claimed rebel forces were weary and dispirited and that without excessive bloodshed he will be able to take capitol within four or five days. Denied there was any unrest in countryside. We believe there is substantial unrest in <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0216"/>countryside and while giving <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> credit for pulling armed forces together and instilling fighting spirit doubt that he has strength to do anything more than achieve stalemate in the city at probable cost of weakening loyalists military strength in interior.</p>
                        <p>Imbert is obviously very pro <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> but is typical Latin American reactionary in his approach to political, economic and social problems. We told <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> we are merely consulting and promised to let him know Washingtonʼs views tomorrow. Meeting with <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> committee was depressing. Argentinian and Colombian representatives expressed their displeasure at lack of creature comforts. Committee obviously deeply hurt that UN has intervened in situation.<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">At 10:30 a.m., May 14, the UN Security Council met and unanimously approved a resolution calling for a cease-fire and inviting Secretary General U Thant to send a representative, <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Jose Mayobre</persName>, to observe and report on the situation. The Secretary Generalʼs advance team arrived in Santo Domingo the afternoon of May 15; Mayobre arrived on May 18.</note> Said they plan to return tomorrow to Washington to discuss with meetings of Foreign Ministers. Questioned whether they had legal authority to do anything other than investigate and report. I made obvious answers and urged that <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> could best reply to UN initiative by doing effective job instead of debating legalistic and theological problems in <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. I informed them of opportunity which our current efforts to establish coalition government might give them to reestablish <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> prestige by reporting success instead of failure. Promised to get in touch with them again tomorrow and hope to be able to keep them on the job.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious they shrink from assuming responsibility and almost pathetic in hope that non-violent solution can be found. Doubt they will approve use of force by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or loyalist forces without full and lengthy debate and meeting of Foreign Ministers in Wash and without detailed instructions from their government. Their mood is one of depression and defeat. Have not seen <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> yet although understand they made progress with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. Will meet tomorrow at 7:30 Washington time and will report joint appraisals. Meanwhile it is clear we must make our decision very soon or risk falling between stools.</p>

                        <p>69. May 65. From Davidson, <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>. Nine hours with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ2">Benitez</persName> leave us moderately encouraged.</p>
                        <p>Most important result is specific agreement that suitable persons of our choosing would work with their official to develop plan and come to agreement as to how to handle Communists and our people will continue to participate for such time as necessary. We agreed that while internment or departure of Communists would be among the possibilities for dealing with them, these are not exclusive since other techniques may be preferable in light of practical situation.</p>
                        <p>Second good result is agreement that Minister of Armed Forces must be agreed between rebels and loyalists. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> are surprisingly hopeful that such agreement can be reached. Third, proposed cabinet, after two of our challenges were accepted, goes further toward national unity than we anticipated. Names are being sent separately for expert review. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> is clearly pro <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. He is a decent man with more political sense than political energy. He does not seem to us very strong, but we believe his repeated assertion of convinced anticommunism. His great devotion to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is plain, and we had little chance for separate talk with him. But he repeatedly expressed genuine determination to accept full responsibility himself and we believe he means it, at least for now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> mystique shows strongly in <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>ʼs own admiration and in his plausible report of other respected persons of various backgrounds who will serve in cabinet only if <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> approves. Whole discussion shows solid base of your basic policy: Constitution si, communism no.</p>

                            <item>At 1950, the President and others entered the Cabinet Room and the meeting on the Dominican Republic began. The President expressed his concern over the “beating” which we are taking in other countries and noted that we have got to make clear what we have been doing and why. There then ensued a lengthy conversation between the President and Mr. Davidson over the complicated problem of obliging <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> to keep the agreement about picking up the Communists and Trujillistas as soon as a new government is announced. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> has been opposing immediate action of this kind.<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3">In another memorandum for the record of this meeting, drafted by <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName> on May 17, the following appears on this point: “<persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> felt it would create a lot of Communist sympathizers if the known Communists were too abruptly picked up after a semblance of peace was restored to the Island. On the other hand, it was agreed that internment or departure would be strongly imposed on the Communists and this had been agreed on by <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>.” (Central Intelligence Agency, DCI (<persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>) Files, Executive Registry Subject Files, Job 80–R01580R, Box 15, Dominican Republic, Folder 302)</note> There was also discussion of the very important posts in the Cabinet of Minister of the Armed Forces and Chief of the Army.<note n="4" xml:id="d75fn4">This topic was discussed for 18 minutes during a telephone call placed by <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> to the President at 7:12 p.m. on May 16.

Davidson described <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> as a good and decent man but pointed out that he is not a strong character. The President asked if it might not be better to make <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> the new president. Davidson replied that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has categorically refused to become president again and that it is even doubtful whether he will ever return to the Dominican Republic.</item>

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> proposed that we make some reduction in our troop strength as soon as other Latin countries have made contributions to the Inter-American Force. Davidson recommended, and the President agreed, that no United States troop reductions should be made until the new government is formed, at which point significant withdrawals should be made even though it was understood that some troops will stay in the Dominican Republic indefinitely. Troop withdrawal is regarded as a significant gesture in the Hemisphere.</item>

                            <item>The President inquired of <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> whether we should do more propagandizing of Latin American countries about what we are doing and why. <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> pointed out that those countries which oppose us do so because of domestic problems and that there is nothing much we can say which will lead them to change their public positions. At his request, we agreed to send <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> our material on <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> which shows that there is a history of insanity in his family.</item>

                            <item>It is clear that one of the stickiest problems facing us is how we work out with a new Dominican government who is or is not a Communist. The practical application of a joint approach to this problem was discussed inconclusively.</item>

                        <p>1752. For the President from <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>First day in Santo Domingo persuades all of us that even a temporary settlement will be hard to get. With great pain and difficulty Davidson has built a long bridge out from <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> to this brutalized and fanatically divided island but a day of most intense discussion shows <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0221"/>that this bridge has no solid pillars on the opposite bank yet. Moreover <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and other right-wingers are trying to knock it down before it is built.</p>
                        <p>First disconcerting experience was violent rebel rejection of yesterdayʼs agreed principle that Minister of Armed Forces should be chosen by joint agreement of contending forces. With <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Hector Aristy</persName> reportedly in the lead rebels appear to have insisted violently to <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> on Montes Arrache who holds this post under <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and is totally unacceptable to loyalists. When I repudiated this wild notion <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> fell back upon Rafael Hernandez. I pointed out that by agreement we were already asking loyalists for their list of acceptable names and injection of any single rebel name would produce justified and violent charge of bad faith. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> then asserted with every show of conviction tinged by relief that in that case there was no further chance of his success and he should give up. No question that rebel military leaders shook him badly. In this situation I suggested possibility of delaying appointment of defense secretary and retention of his powers by president himself. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> revived remarkably and went off to try this on the rebels.</p>
                        <p>He returned shortly with their agreement, but agreement only masked dangerous concession by him to rebel leaders which led to my telephonic reports.<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">See <ref target="#d75fn1">footnote 1, Document 75</ref>.</note> He was offering rebel control over nomination of Chief of Army Staff, while masking this proposal with offer of equal privilege to loyalists on Navy and Air Chiefs. When questions revealed his unwillingness or unacceptability to name prospective Army Chief, I took time out. Washington calls and our own deliberations now persuade us that only possible solution is in our own pressure for particular names which on some of the evidence are digestible by both sides. We find no such name for Minister of Armed Forces but we (a) will probe that acceptability of Nelton Gonzales and Sosa Estrada with loyalists tomorrow though latter is known to Embassy as a thief and (b) await reaction of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> on two of names given by loyalists and passed to Davidson. Our own belief is that most promising pattern now is temporary vacancy in this Ministry and a slate of de Leon for the Army, Jimenez for the Navy and Nelton Gonzales for the Air Force. We plan strong effort for this ticket tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile loyalistsʼ generals spent most of <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>ʼs day on extended and passionate arguments over folly of our planned compromise, with focus on their violent objections to 1963 constitution. This seems foolish but <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> join in first-hand judgement that it is literally a fighting matter to loyalist leaders. We are correspondingly <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0222"/>grateful for prompt and imaginative legal help from Davidson and bespeak his help with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> again tomorrow. Meanwhile we have heard nothing about planned approach by <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. We shall need <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs help both with general public and with rich and respectable who now fear U.S. sellout to Commiesʼ best friend <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing deals only with bargaining details. Underlying questions are those reported by telephone: with <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> we shall have no quick end to Communist threat, but equally no quick Communist takeover. We shall have long contest with Communists not unlike battle in France after 1944 but with no French civilization and no deGaulle. If instead we back loyalists to the limit, we could certainly “win”, but I doubt if we could remove U.S. troops for years. This island is cockpit of senseless hate where no strong and responsible leadership has yet emerged and where energy is largely polarized to extreme left and extreme right.</p>
                        <p>My own firm conclusion is that we should persist in present effort to establish <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> promptly but without any concessions whatever in basic agreed position, since some entrenched elements in rebel command are sworn enemies to us, and to <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> himself in the long-run. Right now net of short-run pressure runs against rebels so we have some leverage if only we can keep our honest farmer from going happily home.</p>
                        <p>Your motto is still right but both “si” and “no” must be somewhat qualified no matter what course we take. The guns are in the streets, and there is no Dominican will or way to get them back soon.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: Mr. President, we have [met] with both sides tonight and by the use of the very strenuous verbal measures with the loyalists military we have a bargain. We want you to know that we have in effect said that we are taking the responsibility—this is what they said to Cy—that they accept the fact that we have the power to do so, that they themselves will accept it but they cannot vouch for their forces. There is a sadness on their side which is shared by many of us. The fact remains that within the basic terms State worked out over the last three days, we are in a position now to go ahead. While we differ in our enthusiasm, I think itʼs fair to say that that is our basic recommendation. Itʼs certainly mine. We have a number of specific things which I propose to say to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">G[uzman]</persName> within the next half hour, not in a way that will engage him in a lot of negotiation with some of the people he has to be careful about, but in a way which I hope will engage him to you. In return for which I will say: while these things are going on, he can expect you to move in the two directions in which Mr. Davidson discussed with you this afternoon with respect to troops and assistance.<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">Not further identified.</note> The most important thing I will get clear with him is just as we have defended the “si,” we expect him now to work continuously on the “no.” And that we will be with him and that he will be with us and that we will be watching this in all its manifestations in terms of internal political activity, in terms of attempts to worm into the bureaucracy, in terms of party relations, and indeed across the board. We have no doubt of his good faith, but his skill and energy are another matter. We will press very hard for both public attitudes and real performance with respect to an outbreak of vengeance which we expect to appear primarily from what are now the rebels, but also individual cases of revenge from the other side. I donʼt know how to describe to you the levels of personal hatred we have encountered as we have gone around to the different factions in recent days. We want both <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0224"/>his posture to be, and our practice to be, that we are going to protect individuals whose lives in this sense are in vengeful danger.</p>
                        <p>This may involve us, it will involve us, in asking <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName> to offer local asylum, which he is already doing, and also in our offering asylum within the United States, possibly by special waivers under the Immigration laws. We will be expecting to press also for the maximum Inter-American Force presence in terms of Inter-American relations—at least in scope and size for as long as needed and we think it will be some time. We expect to press for maximum <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> participation within the Inter-American law which means essentially observation of the referendum. This is something which will help us with the soldiers with which <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Cy Vance</persName> has been talking.</p>
                        <p>We expect to press for <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> participation in the announcement that we are considering now—at what time to turn around the chicken-livered lazybones that went home this afternoon because they wouldnʼt believe us.<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">Reference is to the 5-man <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Commission; see <ref target="#d52fn2">footnote 2, Document 52</ref>.</note> We hope to wake them up at the hour that is most inconvenient for them.</p>
                        <p>We will plead for magnanimity in public expression towards those who have held temporary roles on both sides. This is something which we need very much for those who feel or will feel more and more as the thing comes out that we have merely used them in a stop-gap role. Finally, or next to last, we will reinforce in him a conviction which he has expressed to me at least six times that the most important practical task in the government is to find ways to bring arms in out of the hands of the civilians and into the hands of authorities, and that we share this view and that our means will be available to him. We are inclined to think that in the first stages people may be much more ready to give their weapons to <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName> than to any other Dominican, and in later stages there may be a matter of bounty in which we would be willing to take into account.</p>
                        <p>We will stress to him what I am sure he will understand because it has been the spirit of our discussions for the last 3 days that everything we are asking of him is within the terms of what we have understood and that everything we are able to do for him will necessarily be related to continued performance so that we enter into a continuing partnership in which their dependence upon us becomes continuous to their doing what we hope and believe and urge needs to be done. This conversation I believe will have about 80 percent success in specifics and 90 percent success in attitude and I think it will then lead us off to the practical matter of how we announce it and who says what and that and at what time during the next 24 hours. But before we <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0225"/>move to that, I would like to ask you if this basic line of argument and operation is satisfactory to you.</p>
                        <p>President: Yes, it sounds all right. What he had agreed on for the army, the name we gave?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: We agreed on the young man whom we were checking this afternoon <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">J[uan]</persName> L[ora] F[ernandez].</p>
                        <p>President: All right. Are you all pretty well satisfied on all these people so far as the second part of our slogan is concerned?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: As far as the “no,” yes—we are satisfied about all three of them, but I should tell you that there are some other people whom—I didnʼt mention one other thing we wish to do which is to arrange to have the most hated men on both sides go on agreeable military assignments outside the country, and a couple of those if we can work it will be bad hats, but I canʼt be sure that this will be done in the first day or so. There are people whom we have to be watchful of. This is known by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">G[uzman]</persName>, but there is a problem of timing here on which I cannot give guarantees, but the public names and the official responsibilities which we have agreed to, are without exception, clean as far as we know.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: What did you do on the top minister?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: We couldnʼt get him, we have none. I have tried very hard to get them to reconsider that because it would help a lot but I donʼt exclude that down the road he may want to make an appointment of his own in that area.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: You mean Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">G[uzman]</persName> will hold that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: No. No one will hold it. The Constitution makes him the Commander-in-Chief. He thus avoids being in the position that <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid Cabral</persName> was which was very unpopular with everybody. Now, our notion of the announcement, if youʼre ready to move on to that.</p>
                        <p>President: Yes.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion on the timing of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> announcement and concurrent announcements in Washington.]</p>
                        <p>President: How does it look to you?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, I recommend it.</p>
                        <p>President: When you precede it with a “well” it makes me think youʼre less than—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: No, I recommend it wholeheartedly. I want to underscore what Mac [<persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>] said that the hatred here is almost ancestral and the most savage that I have ever seen on all sides, and weʼre just not going to have peace and harmony, in my opinion suddenly, out of a thirty year tradition of this kind. Itʼs just a tough situation.</p>
                        <p>President: Now, weʼre not getting into any position where the people can truthfully or effectively say that we sold out and turned it over to the Commies?</p>
                        <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0226"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: No, no they canʼt say that truthfully, and weʼve done a great deal of talking about this and this is something that will have to be done—weʼll have to watch it and continue to work on it and have our best people working on it. It can be accomplished gradually.</p>
                        <p>President: What can we say to the right-wingers, up to the end that we have insured against their running the government?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, we have in this work an undertaking in several parts. One, is to fight them politically all across the board—on labor unions and the places—education—the places where they usually concentrate. Two, not to take any of them into the government into positions of power, including the armed forces and the police, and in general to consider them as political enemies and not political allies. Now we expect to have that kind of an understanding.</p>
                        <p>President: Are they going to let you bring in <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">J. Edgar Hoover</persName>ʼs man<note n="4" xml:id="d77fn4">Not further identified.</note> to come in as legal adviser to the Embassy to advise Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">G[uzman]</persName> on the bad characters and have him watch them?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Yes, they have agreed to that.</p>
                        <p>President: How are you going to get Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> to quit making these inflammatory statements?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: We may get some more.</p>
                        <p>President: I thought Mac said you were going to take care of it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Iʼm going to do my best.</p>
                        <p>President: You know us right-wingers are supposed to hang together, <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Tom</persName>.</p>
                        <p>[Laughter]</p>
                        <p>President: I thought we gave him what we wanted when we said weʼd give him a referendum.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is an update by <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> on news that <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> would hold a press conference the next day.]</p>
                        <p>President: What is your
[<persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>ʼs] assessment of the relative strength of the two forces—the loyalists versus the rebels?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: I would say in the northern part of the city, thereʼs an even stand-off and in the southern part where the rebelʼs main strength is, which is the strongest part, I donʼt think that the loyalist forces are strong enough to take them on.</p>
                        <p>President: What would you envision if we didnʼt have an agreement?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: If we just let them continue to fight, sir?</p>
                        <p>President: Yes.</p>
                        <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0227"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: I donʼt think the loyalists could do it.</p>
                        <p>President: Well, is it better to let them demonstrate that?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: How do you mean, to let them continue to fight, sir?</p>
                        <p>President: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: This could go on, but, I donʼt think they can clean up the northern part for several days at least and I feel quite certain that they could not take the rebels in the South.</p>
                        <p>President: All right, now, would it be better from the reaction in this country and in the world, if we let it come to more or less an impasse. Would it look like now we sold out pretty quick?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: No sir, I donʼt think it would look this way.</p>
                        <p>President: Do you recommend what they are suggesting?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: Yes, I do.</p>
                        <p>President: Do you think we have insurance against the Communists taking control of the government?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: I believe we could block that, sir. I think the danger is what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> pointed out.</p>
                        <p>President: Is this the way to block it? Is this agreement the best way open to us at this stage to block it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: Yes sir, it is. I think this is the best way to handle it.</p>
                        <p>President: What is your judgment if these Chiefs say theyʼll go along as to whether their troops will follow them or not or will we have a lot of sporadic fighting under somebody elseʼs leadership.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: We canʼt really tell. I donʼt believe that this will cause much trouble unless very strong leaders come forward and, I donʼt think they will come forward.</p>
                        <p>President: Are you impressed with the strength of any of the people in the government that we are proposing?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>President: Do you think they are honest?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>President: Do you think they are anti-Communist?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: Yes. Thereʼs always going to be sleepers in there, but this is a chance you run regardless. In this situation, youʼre going to come to a conclusion like this sooner or later whether you control all the cities or not.</p>
                        <p>President: Are you going to be in a position if we make the agreement to control the loyalistsʼ equipment?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: You mean to block them?</p>
                        <p>President: Yes.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: Yes. We can physically keep the Air Force from taking off, and the Navy.</p>
                        <p>President: What about the tanks?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: I donʼt think thereʼs enough of them to worry about. We can block them too.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is a brief report by <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">Palmer</persName> on the number of Dominican troop casualties and the economic situation in the Dominican Republic.]</p>
                        <p>President: Is your country team down there pretty generally in agreement that this is the thing to do?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: Yes, sir. I would say they would agree that this is the lesser of many evils, sir. There is no approved solution to this, Mr. President.</p>
                        <p>President: Well, it doesnʼt look like to me thereʼs much evil in this if we (a) get reasonably honest people, if theyʼre anti-Communist, if weʼre going to have a popular referendum in two months on the basics of the machinery, the constitution, and if weʼre not going to let the men go back in office who were thrown out illegally some time ago. Now, I donʼt know what else you can do. We can pick a dictator and just say, well, to hell with the constitution, or we could pick the constitution and say, to hell with the people. Weʼre not going to let them decide on it one way or another, but doing neither, and it looks like to me that weʼre being about as democratic as you can be and weʼre giving them protection and weʼre giving them food and feeding them and giving them supervised elections, while whatever elements of democracy they have in the country are permitted to function. I donʼt know what else we could do if we stayed there a million years.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Palmer</persName>: I agree with that assessment. As you say we either go to do it today or 10 years from now, you canʼt delay the issue today.</p>
                        <p>President: What does <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> think about this agreement?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>: Well, I feel frankly that we weʼre running a risk, keeping a lot of our assets without getting anything very firm, but I think weʼve gone into it and we have to go ahead.</p>
                        <p>President: Is there any better, more hopeful alternative to us at this stage?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>: I donʼt see much quite frankly. I think this is best in our own interests and that is what we have to think of at this stage.</p>
                        <p>President: Well, if thatʼs true, then it would be better in the countryʼs interest too, wouldnʼt it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>: Well, thatʼs our hope, yes sir.</p>
                        <p>President: What does Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName> think of the agreement?</p>
                        <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0229"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName>: I concur. I think itʼs probably the best of a bad bunch of alternatives. I think that the side that was militarily winning is now in fact going to be declared the winner. I think that same side has the kind of popular support throughout the country that we can read it and for that reason also I think itʼs correct. I do feel very likely that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">G[uzman]</persName> may not prove strong enough to hold this place together and we may have to go under ground later on, but I think that would be true of almost any solution that we found. I think that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">I[mbert]</persName> will denounce us and say that we double-crossed him, and heʼs right to a considerable extent. Heʼll make trouble in statements tomorrow and may try to make other trouble which we can stop. He will make trouble for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">G[uzman]</persName> in the future. I think trouble of this kind is probably inevitable in this. This is about the way I feel about it.</p>
                        <p>President: You recommend the agreement, you think itʼs the best we can do under the circumstances and it gives us something to work for.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName>: Thatʼs right sir.</p>
                        <p>President: You believe we have the best man that we can get thatʼll take over?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName>: I think in the present set of circumstances, that that is the best we can do sir.</p>
                        <p>President: Do you think there are any Communists in the crowd?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName>: I do not think this would be a major problem. No, sir.</p>
                        <p>President: The answer is no?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName>: Thatʼs right.</p>
                        <p>President: The country team, the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> people, the attachés, and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>ʼs people—do most of them generally share your views?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName>: Insofar as I know.</p>
                        <p>President: Is there anyone representing the United States that is violently disagreeing with us?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName>: No, I think not.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here are comments by <persName>Johnson</persName> praising <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName> for his efforts and warning him not to work too hard.]</p>
                        <p>President: How many people are going to wind up in this Cabinet?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: We do not have a complete Cabinet yet.</p>
                        <p>President: How many do you think will wind up in it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: I would guess eight or ten. Thereʼs a total possible slate of 15 cabinet slots. We just heard that one of the naval secretaries may not serve as Chief of Staff which is really not Cabinet but itʼs very important. So, I would say we donʼt have more than four or five of the top posts with agreed candidates at this point.</p>

                        <p>President: Are those people who are taking it are they agreeable to doing it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: As far as I know all of those we have talked about were agreeable except one which might not go along.</p>
                        <p>President: Whatʼs his problem?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: He just doesnʼt like it. Itʼs the feeling that this is not going to be good for the country and that it is going to bring instability and create a danger from the military point of view of a left-wing take over—an anti-<persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> feeling.</p>
                        <p>President: I thought he had been agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, Mr. President, that is true at one time or another, but that depends on what hour you talk to people. The emotions are running very high. They have in the past agreed on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">G[uzman]</persName>, but they have also said that he is nothing but a puppet. We donʼt think that is necessarily true, but the political emotions here are just at this particular time absolutely indescribable. Iʼve never seen anything like it. I donʼt think any of our group has.</p>
                        <p>President: All right. I guess weʼve talked long enough. Everybody down there seems to think that it is the best thing to do, so I think that you and <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> ought to go out and put on your Sunday-go-meeting clothes and take this <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and give him the best that youʼve got.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is a short discussion on the timing of the announcement.]</p>
                        <p>President: Whatʼs your evaluation of this?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>: My evaluation is, Mr. President, that this is the best that can be done, and we ought to do it.</p>
                        <p>President: Do it even if the Chiefs went against us?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>: Yes, because I think that this depends on a meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> later on tonight that they will not actively oppose it, but will accept it under protest. Now they say they cannot speak for their troops, but itʼs my evaluation that they will not actively oppose it. They might in words, but not in deeds.</p>

                        <list>
                            <label>A.</label>
                            <item>Three basic difficulties we have encountered from outset here in seeking POL solution are that (1) it has not been clear that men we are negotiating with truly represent real power; (2) each side, like Chinese warlord, has true mil force and can and has used that force to disrupt every POL move we have attempted if it thought disruption was to its advantage; (3) we have not had true control because we have not in fact physically interposed our superior mil forces between the contending mil forces.</item>
                            <label>B.</label>
                            <item>To meet these difficulties and improve atmosphere in which POL negotiations are conducted, we propose that we physically interpose our mil forces between the contending DOM mil forces.<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> introduced this proposal to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> during a telephone conversation at 11:55 a.m., May 18. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, Tape F65.33, Side A, PNO 3)</note> We would first consult with both sides and decision to proceed would depend on reactions. This would be done through SYG–<gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>
                                <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName>, supplemented by approaches through our own channels. We would also ask Amb <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> to give <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Comm in Wash an opportunity to concur in proposed action. <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> would explain to Comm that this action is essential because of continued heavy fighting in north side of city.</item>
                            <label>C.</label>
                            <item>The advantages to this course are (1) it would show the world we are truly neutral, truly humanitarian, truly desirous of stopping the killing; (2) it would give us more control since we could prevent either side from shooting POL negotiations out from under us and, hopefully, would limit radio capabilities of both sides; (3) it would enable us to pursue POL negotiations with reduced pressure of threats from either side to resume mil action; (4) if taken with <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Comm endorsement, it will serve to demonstrate that <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> is acting effectively to enforce a cease-fire and this will reduce pressure in UNSC for further UN involvement.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>A bonus of significant value would be demonstrable indication to local U.S. and international observers, including press, of neutrality of U.S. forces with respect to both DOM sides. Since loyalist forces are <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0232"/>able to concentrate in NW part of city, while bulk of the rebel forces are confined to southern part of city through presence of U.S. troops, present mil situation definitely favors loyalist side in area north of <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>. Thus, U.S. is credibly open to charge of greatly favoring loyalist side.</p>
                        <p>Military Plan: Operation involves establishing a new corridor starting from intersection of present <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> with Avenida 30 de Marzo and extending to NW along this road to intersection of Avenida San <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName> with Avenida Maria Montes, then north along latter to 28th Street, thence west to Avenida Maximo Gomez and finally north along latter to Peynado Bridge. First part of new corridor would include seizure of studios of Radio Santo Domingo which is currently heavily defended and inoperable. As an alternative, Radio Santo Domingo could be bypassed by establishing detour one or two blocks south of Avenida San <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName> in area of radio studios.</p>
                        <p>From intersection of Avenida San <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName> with Avenida Maria Montes north to Peynado Bridge, corridor is presently held by loyal <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> forces. Thus this operation must be based on at least accepted replacement of those forces by U.S. troops and withdrawal to west of any loyal forces east of Avenida Maria Montes. A brigade of 3 bns from 82nd ABN Div would be used for this operation with 2 bns moving north in column from a line of departure at <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> where it crosses Avenida 30 de Marzo and linking up with 1 bn helicopter lifted into the area south of Peynado Bridge.</p>
                        <p>The above operation would provide (1) an effective interposition of U.S. forces between loyal and rebel forces which would prevent either side from attacking the other; and (2) an effective sealing off of rebels in city since, in addition to corridor operation, the far bank of Isabela River would be screened from Peynado Bridge to its junction with Ozama River and latter screened south to its mouth flowing into sea; and (3) positive security of major industrial area of city.</p>
                        <p>Finally, this operation seems to us likely to increase whatever chance there is of agreement on lines we have sought. It would show rebels we can and will ensure cease-fire and it would greatly reduce possibility of armed action by <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> after agreement is announced.</p>

                            <item>Though I remain least pessimistic senior officer here, I am deeply shaken by this morningʼs monkey-wrench.<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2" type="source">In a telephone conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at 11:55 a.m., May 18, <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> sent him a message explaining the reasons for the sudden impasse. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> read <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>ʼs message to the President: “I have the obligation to suspend conversations and agreements until there has been a total cease-fire. This is because yesterday the Constitutionalists troops permitted the troops of San Isidro to penetrate the city, [at this point <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> inserted: ‘this is a description of the action in the north in their terms’] so the press and the representatives of the United Nations could see for themselves that these advances are protected by the Americans. It is established that the United States is giving arms, ammunition, and all kinds of military help to the anti-constitutional forces. [<persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> inserted: ‘Thatʼs not so incidentally.’] The troops of San Isidro and <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> have been permitted pass through the line of communication and in some case they have even been protected with helicopters. This has obliged me to terminate the conversations and the agreement until a cease-fire has been achieved.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of a telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, Tape F65.33, Side A, PNO 3)</note> It forces reconsideration of question of basic control of a possible <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> government. You can judge better than I the role of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, but the stoogeʼs role of <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> in this episode is clear and unless your evidence to the contrary is conclusive, my own guess is that military command initiated this proposal, whoever concurred in it.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Since military command arrangements of yesterday proposed to put a relatively unknown <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">colonel</persName> over a group of men whose collective energy and determination is amply demonstrated in recent weeks, and since <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> obediently telephoned a clearly absurd ultimatum to Embassy, none of us can responsibly recommend that agreement all but completed yesterday is now safe for the United States. Evidence is strong that it would put real control of all Dominican ground forces in hands of those who now have this control downtown. At the very minimum, and on optimistic assumptions about influence of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and impact of office on <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>, we should have a very hard up-hill road requiring constant energy and skill in daily infighting.</item>

                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Apparently all of us in Washington and here agree that there are men in rebel command who prefer continued struggle to any agreement they do not control. In the light of the last daysʼs events, I do not think <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>ʼs government on presently negotiated basis is good enough for us to bet on. Nor do I think time is running out down here.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>In this situation I believe that when negotiations are reopened we should advance new requirements which combine advantage of testing basis of authority and limiting role of present military command in new government. I think of two such provisions.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>The first is elimination of three least desirable members of rebel command by appointment abroad. This is parallel to plan already accepted by loyalists and I would nominate <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName>, Tavaras, and Monte Arache.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Second, I would reopen question of Minister of Armed Forces and insist on re-establishment of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> agreement that a man acceptable to both sides be found.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>I pressed both of these ideas yesterday but did not insist in face of absolute refusal because we wanted agreement and hoped it would work. Now I believe that strong and sustained pressure for these provisions is essential:

                        <p>At about noon on May 17, Mr. Arnold<note n="4" xml:id="d80fn4">A pseudonym for <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName>.</note> called me by telephone to say an unexpected crisis had arisen in connection with our negotiations. At his request, I met with him in the Situation Room at the White House as soon as I could get there. Mr. Arnold briefed me on recent developments and we reached agreement on the strategy for attempting to prevent a break-down in the negotiations. The text of our agreement as written up at that time is quoted below:</p>

                        <p>The nature of the plebiscite is not yet finally decided, but it would probably be a yes or no vote with the 1962 constitution coming into effect automatically in the event the vote goes against continuation of the 1963 constitution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Arnold and I agreed that it would be necessary to tell <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> that tentative agreement had already been reached on <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> as a single interim president to serve out the remainder of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs term.</p>
                        <p>With respect to item 4—Tactics, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> might bring this subject up himself (if <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> failed to do so) in the following manner:</p>
                        <p>After he and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> had reached general agreement on a plan for establishing a government of national concordance:

                                    <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would say that it would be highly desirable to give the people an opportunity to express their satisfaction with the arrangements.</item>

                                <item>Since no election will be held until 1966 under the arrangement that has been agreed to, a referendum or plebiscite might serve both of the foregoing objectives.</item>

                                <item>Since the establishment of the government would be a fait accompli, a referendum or plebiscite could be held on the question of acceptance or rejection of the 1963 constitution.</item>

                                <item>People could make speeches, get a little practice in politics, and once the constitution had been ratified the government would have additional claim to complete legitimacy and constitutionality.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>Only one question arose in considering the practicality of this approach: At the time it was being developed, neither Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName> nor Mr. Arnold knew whether Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was for or against the 1963 constitution.</p>
                        <p rend="center">END TEXT</p>
                        <p>It was 1:30 p.m. by the time the foregoing agreement had been reached. If <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was to be contacted to enlist his cooperation prior <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0237"/>to his departure from New York at 5:00 p.m. (en route to Puerto Rico), it was necessary for me to catch the 2:00 p.m. Eastern Airlines shuttle. Even this would allow very little margin in the time frame in which the mission had to be carried out. Accordingly, I called Irving Davidson<note n="5" xml:id="d80fn5">Another pseudonym for <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName>. In a telephone conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> at 11:55 a.m., May 18, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> instructed <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> to refer to <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName> “hereafter, under all circumstances as … Mr. Arnold, nothing else, ever.” According to the President “a lot of confusion” had surfaced over the use of <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>ʼs pseudonyms in the reports he had seen.

                                    <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName>: The Rise and Ruin of a Supreme Court Justice</hi> (New York: William Morrow &amp; Co., 1988).</note> and asked him to stand by his telephone for the next half hour. I asked him to locate <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in New York and have him stand by his telephone also. Meanwhile, Mr. Arnold sought clearance for the plan through Mr. Moyer.</p>
                        <p>At 1:45 p.m., Mr. Moyer informed Mr. Arnold that approval had been granted for execution of the plan. I called Mr. Davidson to tell him that I wished to meet with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in New York prior to his departure for Puerto Rico. I asked Mr. Davidson to arrange for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to meet me in the lobby of the Regency Hotel in New York at 3:45 p.m. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was to be alone at the time of our meeting. I would undertake to deliver him to <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> Airport in time to make his 5:00 p.m. plane to Puerto Rico.</p>
                        <p>By holding the 2:00 p.m. Eastern Airlines shuttle to New York for a few minutes, I was able to get aboard.</p>
                        <p>As the Eastern shuttle approached New York, the Captain called me into the pilotʼs compartment to tell me that a representative of the New York Port Authority would meet me when the plan landed to give me a message. I was to get off the plane before any of the other passengers and go to the Port Authorityʼs offices for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>The message turned out to be a request that I telephone Mr. Arnold at the White House. When I was able to get through to Mr. Arnold, he informed me that the plebiscite problem had been resolved. It would not be necessary to sell <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> on this. I should limit my talk with him to providing him with a background briefing on where things stood as of that time. “Do it lightly and get him to go along if you can. If not, at least get him to agree not to raise objections.”</p>
                        <p>I arrived at the Regency Hotel at 3:40 p.m. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was not there. At 3:50 p.m. he had still not appeared on the scene, but Irving Davidson had some how managed to get to New York and joined me in the lobby of the Regency Hotel.</p>
                        <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0238"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> turned up at about 3:55 p.m. I told him time was short—I had a cab standing by—I would brief him on developments since our last meeting as we drove to <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> Airport. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> said we would have to wait until 4:00 p.m. as his suitcase was in the car which had dropped him off at the hotel and it would not be back until 4:00 p.m. He suggested we ride out to <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> Airport in “his car”. I objected, pointing out that I did not want to have anyone else listening in on our conversation. He said this would not be a problem as “his car” had been provided by the FBI at his request. I let my cab go.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs car” turned up at 4:00 p.m. sharp. It was driven by Special FBI Agent Nick F. Estame. The senior Special Agent accompanying him was Heinrich Von Eckardt.<note n="6" xml:id="d80fn6">At 3:02 p.m. on May 17 <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">Hoover</persName> telephoned President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to inform him of <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName>ʼs meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in New York City. <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">Hoover</persName> told President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> that an “I. Irving Davidson” arranged this meeting and described Davidson as “a con man in Washington.” <persName>Johnson</persName> explained to <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">Hoover</persName> that “Davidson” was a pseudonym for <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Abe Fortas</persName> who was under his orders to work the “left wing” and <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Tom Mann</persName> to work the “right wing” in the Dominican Republic negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">Hoover</persName> replied that he did not know this. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> further explained that he wanted the FBI involved to “check the people” referred by former Governor of Puerto Rico <persName corresp="#p_MML1">Munoz-Marin</persName> and other <persName corresp="#p_FA2">Fortas</persName> contacts.

Edgar Hoover</persName>, Tape F65.30, Side A, PNO 2)</note> After examining each otherʼs credentials, we all climbed aboard and started for <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> Airport. I briefed <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> along the lines agreed upon with Mr. Arnold and invited <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs comments and/or questions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> wanted to know how <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> would be selected or elected, as the case might be. I told him I wasnʼt sure, but given <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs strong feelings on the question of constitutionality, it might be necessary to have whatever there was left of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs Congress “elect” <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>. This didnʼt seem to present a problem for <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. However, he had some very firm ideas about the plebiscite or referendum.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> said that he saw two serious problems in holding a plebiscite. First, if the plebiscite went in favor of the 1963 constitution, as he supposed it would, then the 1963 constitution would be set in concrete for the future. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> thought some of its provisions should be modified. He agreed that except for a few sections, the 1963 constitution wasnʼt really a bad document.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> felt much more strongly about the holding of a plebiscite of any kind than he did about its possible consequences as far as it might affect prospects for future amendments to the constitution. According to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, politicking, electioneering and voting should be avoided at all costs until 1966. He felt that far from serving as a means of letting off steam, a vote and the preliminary politicking that would have to precede the plebiscite would increase passions and should be avoided at all costs.</p>
                        <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0239"/>
                        <p>I argued that this was a matter of judgment and in any event, the plebiscite was a condition precedent set by the San Isidro group for going along with the whole deal.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> said he could swing the San Isidro group away from this position without any trouble if this was necessary. As for the question of judgment on the ultimate consequences of politicking and voting under present circumstances, whoever it was that thought this would reduce passions rather than exacerbate the situation just didnʼt know his (the Dominican) people. I pressed the point, making a strong case against his trying to un-stick something that had already been agreed to in the delicate state of negotiations as they then existed. He agreed that both <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> are not rational men, although they are irrational in different ways. He thought he could bring them both around and outlined his ideas of how to go about this.</p>
                        <p>If the San Isidro group could not be budged from its position on the holding of a plebiscite, then <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would go along. But he would go along on the basis of an agreement with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> that he (<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>) would join with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> in supporting ratification of the 1963 constitution, provided <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would agree to two conditions:
<list>
                                <label>1)</label>
                                <item>The plebiscite would confirm the 1963 constitution as the law of the land for the remaining period to be served out by <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>.</item>
                                <label>2)</label>
                                <item>When a new congress took office in 1967, it would be free to amend the 1963 constitution in whatever manner it might see fit.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would reach a private agreement that certain controversial provisions of the 1963 constitution would not be implemented during the interim. By doing it this way, the plebiscite might be carried out without doing too much damage and the country would be protected from those provisions of the 1963 constitution which inhibit private investment and are otherwise unacceptable to the men whose cooperation must be obtained if the national economy is to be resuscitated.</p>
                        <p>I was unable to bring <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> any further along on this particular point and had little time left to cover the remaining ground before we reached <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> Airport. I therefore decided to change the subject, but before doing so, I got <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to promise that he would consult with me before breaking off talks should he reach an impasse on the issue of the 1963 constitution and the plebiscite in his discussions with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. I offered to come to Puerto Rico for this purpose if necessary.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> then raised the problem of how to deal with the communists and the “agitators”. I told him what I understood had been more or less agreed to. He immediately spotted the weak point, i.e., the problem is not where you put them, but how you identify them and reach agreement on the definition of a communist and/or an “agitator” <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0240"/>(<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs term) who may not be a communist but who is more dangerous from the practical standpoint than a clearly identifiable communist. After much discussion, I had to fall back on the point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> made to me when we discussed this by telephone (KY–9), i.e., the key is the man or men who do the job. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> agreed that this might be the answer. He pointed out, however, the men can be appointed or removed very easily once a government has been installed.</p>
                        <p>I attempted to counter this by pointing out that we would have a great deal of leverage, given the magnitude of the aid program we planned for the Dominican Republic once an acceptable government had been installed. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> picked this up immediately. He said massive aid was really not much of a lever. It would, however, help the <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>-dominated <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> government consolidate itself through patronage and otherwise, thus amounting to a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> subvention of the forces against which he would have to contend in the 1966 elections. I attempted to reassure him as best I could, taking into account that there were three other people in the car at that time, at least one of whom spoke fluent Spanish. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> understood, but was not perceptibly reassured.</p>
                        <p>We arrived at the airport at about that point in the conversation and it developed <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> had a reservation but no ticket and no money. Irving Davidson bought <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> a round-trip ticket.</p>
                        <p>There was opportunity for me to speak completely alone with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> for about five minutes before he boarded his plane. I stressed two specifics during this brief interlude:

                        <p>1805. From <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">Palmer</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>. In the event negotiations fail today, we recommend that foll modification of plan proposed in ourtel 1776<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">
                                <ref target="#d78">Document 78</ref>.</note> be carried out ASAP, H-hour to be determined by <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">Gen Palmer</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Loyalists have now moved beyond line proposed in 1776 and have taken Radio Santo Domingo. They are somewhat flushed with success. If they are permitted to take all of area north of <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> will be increasingly difficult to deal with. Proposed plan would deny to him area east of Avenida Duarte, extending to Isabela and Ozama River. Hard core of rebel forces north of <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> is located in area extending from Radio Santo Domingo to Villa Consuela. Proposed plan would leave hard core between loyalist forces and <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>. Thus, rebels would be faced with choice of fighting in place or leaving their weapons and retiring to area south of <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>. We believe recommended plan would establish better conditions both for true cease-fire and for POL settlement since it interposes U.S. forces between loyalists and rebels, except in Villa Consuela. We also believe this action would give evidence of a credible position of U.S. impartiality. Disadvantages of plan are: (1) risk of further alienating <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and loyalist mil leaders; (2) action might be interpreted by <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> forces as strengthening their position by protecting their weak forces from superior loyalist forces. But this is not all bad, given probable conflict among rebels on POL proposals.</p>
                        <p>We believe plan could be carried out with minimum difficulty and that casualties, both mil and civilian, would be light. Estimated time to carry out plan in daylight is four hours. If done at night and surprise is effected, it might be accomplished in less time.</p>
                        <p>We feel <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> should be notified shortly before execution, but not so far in advance as to tip off loyalist and rebel forces. We do not believe UN should be notified in advance.</p>
                        <p>We should not discuss this plan on open telephone as both sides are monitoring.</p>

                            <item>Most important event is capture of Radio Santo Domingo by <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>. This evening he agreed again with <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> that station should be run by <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. Moreover he agrees with us that <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> umbrella should shelter firm U.S. management. He has promised to announce this decision at ten Thursday<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">May 21.</note> morning. Effective use of RSD may be decisive in the coming week. We all believe that now is the time for <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Don Wilson</persName>
                                <note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">Deputy Director, United States Information Agency.</note> to come. He should be here Thursday without fail and he should be ready to stay awhile. He is not needed tonight because station is still on the blink.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Next most important event is rapid <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> advance in area north of <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>. This advance has no final strategic value to <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>, because it does not touch real rebel stronghold. But it lifts morale far beyond its real meaning, and there is no <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> solution in sight tonight that would not be rejected out of hand by <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and Loyalist military. This does not mean that <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> solution is impossible. I continue to believe it makes more sense than any other. But I do not think it can be concluded at an acceptable cost until <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and company find out that their small victories north of <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> have no lasting value. They must learn again that rebels will probably remain in control of heart of city which is heart of country. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> forces cannot dislodge them and our forces will not—if it can be avoided.</item>

                            <item>Further block to early settlement—but not to a later solution—is reported death of Rafael Fernandez Dominguez<note n="4" xml:id="d83fn4">Lieutenant <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Colonel</persName> in the Dominican Army with strong allegiances to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>; a leader of the younger officers.</note> in attack on <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> held palace. This will shock <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> deeply, though <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> has taken it calmly. Utterly cynical rebel assertion that U.S. shot him in the back is seen for what it is by <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>, but <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> is on the air making as <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0247"/>much emotional noise as possible. Unless Commies killed him in Spanish war style, Fernandez died soldierʼs death he partly sought, and three U.S. Marines were wounded resisting rebel action about the same time. For a hot fire fight front and back are silly words. But rebels will be stirred, and <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> will be rightly reenforced in his growing conviction that the men downtown are in no mood for reason.</item>

                            <item>In this situation I think we probably need a carefully staged pause. No solution appears possible now, but we should soon have on the side of peace the following: (a) time (b) the end of the northern battle, and (c) Radio Santo Domingo. Both <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and rebels should learn in coming days that neither of them is going to win a war. RSD should be preaching peace; <persName corresp="#p_SAM1">Solomon</persName> should be practicing good works; by continued firmness <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">Palmer</persName> should be able to prove that the U.S. is the one real power on the scene.</item>

(<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Dominican Republic, Vol. V, 5/19/65–5/31/65)</note> I floated notion of brief delay in reaching final solution, on ground that both sides were in a bad mood for compromise.

                            <item>It remains to report <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>–Amiama contact. First meeting was correct and there will be another Thursday morning at ten. We think the two men respect each other. We think they also have a long way to go before their minds really meet. We continue to think that <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0248"/>their conversations can only do good, and we will press them to keep on. But we will not use our biggest guns to seek immediate paper agreement between them unless you tell us to—if only because Amiama will not agree to serve under <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> at this stage. This agreement is still my strong hope, but all concerned must be softened by a little time before it will be possible. Specifically, Amiama will accept only if his comrades in arms agree, and tonight they see no need for what they call a “surrender to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>.” Moreover Amiama will certainly have a view of his own on critical question of Army Chief of Staff and we strongly doubt that he could accept Lora Fernandez. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> thinks de Leon or Valdes may still be key here.</item>

                        <p>1881. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> at 11:45 a.m., May 21. Purpose was to get him to agree to indefinite extension of truce and to nail down prompt turn-over of Radio Santo Domingo to <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. He treated us to quite a display of verbal histrionics designed to impress on us his determination stand fast on <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> and not accept <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> formula.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> led off by asking him to extend truce beyond 24-hour period. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> reaction was strongly negative. He said rebels have this time agreed to cease-fire because they know they are licked. Arguments by <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> that it is to his interest to project image of man of peace made no perceptible change in his adamant stand. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> said that only solution to Dominican situation is for rebels to surrender under full personal guarantees. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said it was <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> view that continuation of truce would be great contribution and refusal to go along <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0249"/>would be a big mistake. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs rejoinder was that he could clean out downtown in 2 days if <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> did not have his hands tied. He said that he had been tricked into truce. His colleagues had warned him, he added, that if he agreed to a 24-hour truce, he would find himself trapped into a longer one. Request now being made of him was “proof” they were right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> switched subjects by asking <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> when we might expect him to turn RSD over to <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> as he had promised <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> replied he and people repairing station and that he wanted to make speech over RSD to Dominican people before allowing <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> to assume “control.” <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> said this not our understanding of agreement. Further discussion led <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> to say he personally in favor of turning station over to <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and so announcing in his speech but would have to get clearance from his “associates,” including military.</p>
                        <p>Turning conversation to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> efforts to bring about a political solution, <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> declared flatly “I will not accept an agreement with them. I will not enter into agreements with Communists … A return to the 1963 Constitution would be a fatal precedent.” He brought up how he had been urged by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to leave private life to form <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss>. He described struggle in <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> as one between democracy and communism. He said he failed to see why <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, having urged him assume <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> role, was now trying to force him to deal with Communists. He claimed country was with him and rebels represented only 20 city blocks. Given this and Communist nature of rebels, he saw no reason why he should be asked to accept political formulas which ran counter to his personal convictions and to what Dominican people expect of him. He became so exercised at one point that he said if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> wants to pressure and betray him, he will denounce <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> before world opinion. “I will not accept political deals (componendas politicas) imposed by foreign government,” he concluded.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> knew full well that our policy is not to support communism, and we take lessons from no one on danger which communism represents. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said our appreciation of military and political situation is frankly quite different from his. We do not think that either side can win by further killing. Our reading of what Dominican people want is continuation of truce and peaceful formula for political solution and not more bloodshed as implied in <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> request that we allow his troops cross <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> to mop up rebel stronghold.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing that in <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs present state of mind it was not profitable to continue discussion, <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> proposed that those present take time to reflect on views expressed. He told <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> that he wanted him to know that: (1) we think it is very important that truce continue; (2) we desire to have RSD turned over promptly to <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>; and (3) we <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0250"/>plan to continue working toward peaceful solution. Of these, <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> noted, RSD problem was one needing immediate attention. On this it was agreed that: (1) <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> would seek consent other <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> members and inform <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> of response during course of afternoon; (2) we would promptly send technicians to repair facilities; (3) once in operation, <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> would make a broadcast announcing he was turning radio over to <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>; (4) <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> would thereupon assume control over programming. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> said that he wants his troops to guard RSD even after <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> takes over.</p>

                        <p>On May 22, 1965, the Tenth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics adopted a resolution calling for provisions to guide the conduct of the Inter-American Force in the Dominican Republic.

The last provision established a committee to study the functioning and maintenance of the Inter-American Force. The resolution was adopted by a vote of 14–4 (Chile, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru), with 2 abstentions (Argentina, Venezuela).</p>
                        <p>Subsequent to this meeting, General of the Army Hugo Panasco Alvim of Brazil was designated Commander of the Force and Lieutenant <persName corresp="#p_PGBJ1">General Bruce Palmer, Jr.</persName>, of the United States, Deputy Commander.</p>

                        <p>1894. For the President from <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>.</p>

                            <item>In two hours with Benitez and one-and-a-half with me, <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> today flatly refused to propose departure of three leading rebels or even to allow Benitez to propose it. He is honestly convinced that any such move would cost him the confidence of the people and, after battering him at length, Benitez and I are convinced he would quit before he would accept it.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> this attitude raised in my mind serious questions since it showed his unwillingness to take any action now to control rebel general staff. I added that this was doubly difficult for us because we do not know who really runs that group. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>ʼs bright young factotum, Salvador Jorge Blanco, denied this by asserting <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>ʼs clear control. I expressed doubts which <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> did not contest. I asked him for full list of rebel military leaders and remarked that in our judgment there were Communists among them—real Communists and not simply leftist idealists. When they asked for details I agreed to provide them. (We are reviewing composition of this group and will report available facts and impressions in a separate telegram tomorrow.)<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">Telegram 1902 from Santo Domingo, transmitted a list of the proposed <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> cabinet.

                                <p>He agreed completely when I described his position as that of a man who did not think he would have the public and political strength to attempt any split of rebel military leadership at the outset.</p>

                            <item>I told <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> this decision would be very disappointing and that we would have to report it to Washington. He understood but held his ground.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>On all the evidence I do not believe Communists now control the general staff or that general staff will control the government. But if we substitute “influence” for “control” I think both propositions will be true. I think degree of influence can be acceptably low in both cases, especially if we can strengthen cabinet. But it will be present, and it will be observed. On the other hand Benitez visited rebel headquarters <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0252"/>this afternoon and said afterward that Communist issue was laughable. He reports they are really adolescents with guns. I think he may be right.</item>

                            <item>This series of talks reinforces a growing conviction that <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> is both good and weak. He really understands Communist problem and he has stood firm against a cabinet job for the doubtful <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Hector Aristy</persName>. But he is not going to go against those who are seen as heroes of the revolution.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>If we are to go ahead nonetheless—and this is my own firm recommendation—we must plan to give maximum attention to building continuing intensive U.S. relations with <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> and with his non-Communist military.</item>

                            <item>This of course is only an important special example of general proposition that <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> government will at best be caretaker affair, terribly dependent on U.S. handholding.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>We intend to make up on cabinet swings what we have lost on the departure roundabouts. It will be hard work to broaden <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>ʼs base, but we plan to seek <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName>ʼs help. We are aiming for number of outstanding independents, and we also aim to plan with <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> for best joint approach to possible members. We have already softened up de Leon and Postigo by private feelers and believe both will serve.</item>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> was generally receptive, although obviously had some difficulties with Read for Interior and Police and Franco y Franco for Education. Leon, whose presence on cabinet would be welcome in number of sectors including military, was <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>ʼs own proposal in place of our suggestion of Andres Freites. This cabinet would provide strong representation by political independents, would offer <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0253"/>undoubted competence in some key fields (particularly Messina in Finance) and would lay reasonably solid base for credible claim that <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> formula does represent call to national unity. Remains to be seen if <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> will be as agreeable after consulting with <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> group and if most attractive candidates (Garcia, Pastoriza, Messina and Leon) could be persuaded to join.</p>

                            <item>All this leads me to conclusion we are reaching moment of truth on <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> solution. I believe it is still best available. I think I can get <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> to back it strongly. It will have to be pushed down the throats of <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and military, but <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and I can do that too if we are told to do so.

                            <item>The other possibilities that remain are two. One is <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>. We could probably help him to general temporary victory today and with less cost in life than I thought before northern victory. We can probably also get from <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> much wider and stronger cabinet than he now has. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> will be hard and genuine anti-Communist and also pro-American. He will also become hated—though he is not now—because he is a superior man of force and fraud, and knows it, and shows it. I am against him.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>Second remaining possibility is person unknown, somewhere between <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>. This middle man is not in sight. I think we cannot afford to wait for such an unknown. There is sense in which both <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> are temporary and relatively moderate choices. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> is the choice of fear, and <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> is the choice of hope.</item>

                        <p>1896. For the President and the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Following are some pros and cons relevant to your decision:
<list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>
                                    <p>Pro: Solution meets real desires of people.</p>
                                    <p>Con: In <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> we may be buying a sizeable pig in a poke. While it is the kind of liberal-looking solution we would all like to see, some would not give it much survival value.</p>
                                </item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>
                                    <p>Con: We all accept that <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> is a good man, but weak. And he has very little political experience. He himself admits he cannot now control the military group at headquarters and even <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> civilians with firebrand credentials such as Pena Gomez and his group confess they have lost power to influence situation. This headquarters group is very shadowy; we do not really know focus of its control. There is rather general agreement that it is not <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>.</p>
                                    <p>To put a good but weak man up against a group of strong and determined men of dubious motivations and objectives is to provide a set-up for take-over. An honorable man might well choose to get out, but the damage would have been done.</p>
                                    <p>Pro: Headquarters group will not be real center of power after <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> is in, and while we do not know as much about them as we would like, there is no reason to credit them with superhuman skills for day-to-day action after battle ends. Takeover by real Communists is impossible while we are here and we need not leave until we are satisfied it is safe.</p>
                                </item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>
                                    <p>Con: What happens to the Dominican military, a group for whom we have no great admiration but which does represent an organized authority which has had its uses in holding country together this past month against strong undertow and active efforts from Ciudad Nueva. Our forcing them to take <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> and co. is going to be very messy, public affair, and it may well leave armed forces shattered and fragmented. Destruction of up-country military detachments in reflection of divisions in capital could have most serious consequences nationally and could precipitate breakdowns in towns around country which have thus far been avoided. There is nothing extreme left would like better than to see armed forces rent asunder (and filled with <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0255"/>resentment against us) while arms are loose in the streets in such great quantities as at present. We have seen painful results of this elsewhere.</p>
                                    <p>Pro: We have means to prevent this result. Morally we have great authority with <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> and we can have it also with new military chiefs. No one says any of these proposed new authorities is pro-Communist, and we are the ones with logistics, transport and communications.</p>
                                </item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Con: Some of us cannot accept Benitezʼ assumption that the men at rebel headquarters are “adolescents with guns.” There are indeed too many kids with weapons wandering about terrorizing the public and shooting things up for the hell of it—the classic revolutionary tactic of passing out weapons indiscriminately to the “people” was one of the most serious things done here last month. But we have seen too much here these past four weeks to consider the problem merely as a simple one of exuberant youth.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>
                                    <p>Con: It is regrettable we cannot now look forward to departure of any rebel military. If we are to take at face value the notion that the heroes of the revolution are butchers of the <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>, Montes de Arache and Pena Tavares variety (the first two have been killers since Trujilloʼs day and have been so employed—Montes for instance was sent to Venezuela to do in Betancourt, while Pena is perhaps a Communist if reports are to be believed), not to mention worthies such as <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cury</persName>, then the moral base of the revolution and of <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>ʼs government is sadly compromised. On this view, with all their faults, reasonable competent and professional officers such as Rivera Caminero, Jimenez and De Los Santos are preferable. Incidentally, we all agree Wessin must go—and soon.</p>
                                    <p>Pro: The key to this is not in who leaves for a few months. The key is in gradual reassertion of legitimate authority, including that of <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> above all and then of de Leon and service chiefs. Some of us are now convinced that we can do this job better by not forcing departures even if we could—which is very doubtful indeed.</p>
                                </item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>
                                    <p>Con: The alternatives of leadership are bleak, and in the situation which has developed in past week here they lead back to <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>. We all distrust <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>. He is tricky (although within limits) and he is no move forward. However, to some of us he seems less a step backward than <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, whom so many regard as the electoral answer next time. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> has a certain national consciousness, a quality rare among Dominicans; and he has guts, even more rare here. He is not without some appeal in the north and east of country and he has been picking up support as he has been winning. While the people of the country have very burning frustrations and we must move massively to meet their legitimate social and economic aspirations (whatever the governing group), political support for the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> can be exaggerated. (And not all of it necessarily transferable to <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>, who is not a widely <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0256"/>known public figure.) After all, both Trujillistas and the military voted in bloc for <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> in 1962 out of fear of reprisals in event of <gloss target="#t_UCN1">UCN</gloss> victory. They would not do so again. Recent polls showed <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> running well ahead of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, and an admittedly inconclusive polling of “constitutionalist” prisoners taken here by our forces has shown a preference for <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> by just over 50 percent of those interrogated.</p>
                                    <p>Pro: There can be no real doubt—as Postigo told us yesterday—that strong majority of people will prefer <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>.</p>

                                    <p>Con: It should not be too difficult to broaden and strengthen <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs cabinet to give it more appeal and competence. (He already has one <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> man.) Judicious handholding, help and pressure by us could influence him in right directions. He is pro-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> but can go off reservation and get ugly if he feels himself pushed into corner.</p>
                                    <p>Pro: There is truth in this, but the passion for power in <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> is strong, and such men usually manage to take us into camp because they cheat and we do not. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> will be as hard to manage as <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> would be.</p>

                                    <p>Con: Washington may consider <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> too difficult a proposition to sell to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> press and to some good neighbors. We recognize his very real handicaps in this regard. In an ideal world no one would choose <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>; however, our situation here and our prospects are about as un-ideal as possible. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> is at least a going concern and, despite admitted marks against him, is picking up strength. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> has appeal but he has not left the post. And getting him onto the track is going to be difficult.</p>
                                    <p>Pro: The apparent strength of <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and the apparent weakness of <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> can be turned around dramatically when decision is made and some authority delegated. And selling <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> as final result of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intervention is job some of us think <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> could never succeed in doing.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName> feels that U.S. speaking through an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> (person)<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">On May 20 the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> elected <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Jose A.

                        <p>President asked about number of troops under <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>. DCI replied that they were about equal, but DCI agreed with SecDef and SecState that <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> would not be able to dislodge <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> from his positions inside the “new city.”</p>
                        <p>This would result in great loss of life and completely unacceptable to U.S. and the world to let such go on with all of our troops there and in position to prevent. DCI concurred.</p>

                        <p>SecDef feels we should continue talks with military leaders—it should be clear that we are as interested as they to constitute a constitutional (non-commie) government. It is too early for “ultimatum” <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0258"/>stage. We have to know “who is in the back room” behind <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> before we form a government.

(<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Dominican Republic, Vol. V, 5/19/65–5/31/65)</note> available evidence points to Pena Tavares and Garcia German as possibly representing additional significant Communist penetration of rebel high command. We can insist on immediate expulsion of these three as demonstration of <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>ʼs good faith on Communist issue. Substitution on this list of Gonzalez and Garcia for Montes and <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> would have double advantage of avoiding very difficult demand for departure of two major popular “heroes” of the revolution while focusing on real threat of suspected Communist subversives. Our present view of <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> is that he is a tricky nuisance but probably not a Communist.</item>

                                <p>With respect to Communists and Trujillistas:</p>
                                <p>It is understood that effective measures must be taken by the constitutional government to protect the Dominican people from the subversive activities of Communists and Trujillistas. The initial understanding on this point continues as follows:</p>
                                <p>‘These measures will involve their separation from the Dominican community. This may take the form of their internment in some isolated area under Dominican jurisdiction or their departure from the island. Identification of such persons to be effected promptly by mutual consultation and prompt action will follow as aforesaid.’</p>
                                <p>It was later agreed that ‘the detailed procedures would have to be worked out with the new President with the object of accomplishing an effective job utilizing the resources available to all concerned.’</p>
                                <p>Still later it was agreed that while internment and departure of Communists and Trujillistas is permissible, it may have practical disadvantages. It was agreed that the best practicable course will be for persons of U.S. choosing to work closely with the new Minister of Police and come to agreement as to how best to achieve the basic objective. The cooperation of U.S. personnel will be sought and retained <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0262"/>for such time as may be necessary. Such U.S. personnel should be of Spanish-speaking background.”</p>

                        <p>[Omitted here is approximately 4 minutes of conversation on <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>ʼs illness; magazine articles critical of U.S. action in the Dominican Republic and specifically of <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_VJH1">Vaughn</persName>; a proposal for U.S. troop withdrawals from the Dominican Republic; and the possibility of a high-level <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> team, headed by the Brazilian Foreign Minister, to take over negotiations in the Dominican Republic.]</p>
                        <p>President: You donʼt think anything will come out of the negotiations with either side do you?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: No, I donʼt. I think you summed up our feelings early in the game when you said you didnʼt think these negotiations had a 30 percent chance. I feel now just about how I felt then. I donʼt think theyʼre ready; itʼs going to take time. [<persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> references a “piece of information” he sent to the President earlier that morning. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said he read it.]</p>
                        <p>President: I have grave doubts about <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> and I donʼt know what weʼre finally going to do if he should accept all of our terms. I keep making them a little harder on him without getting rid of all the Communists.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: I have a strong feeling that this is right Mr. President. Your instinct is right on that, and we ought to be thinking about—this is kind of a maneuver which is all right if we think of it that way and maybe trying to build something around somebody else when the time comes and under the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> tent.</p>
                        <p>President: Okay, find anybody you might submit as a name?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: There are people around there probably who are not either <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> that you could build around. I think youʼll have to look pretty hard; I canʼt suggest anybody now. But somebody on the ground could find them. I donʼt think we ought to become married to this guy <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> because I just donʼt trust <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> to fight the Commies. And, what Iʼm afraid of is that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is trying to get us to put him in power and to destroy the armies so that there will be nobody to bother him and then once he takes control I think we might be in deep trouble. <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0266"/>Thatʼs my own feeling about it and that came out strongly when I was down there on the ground and everything Iʼve read since I got back tends to confirm this in my mind.</p>
                        <p>President: Iʼm also afraid that heʼll change the cabinet, if it werenʼt pro-Commie it would be after heʼs in there a month.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Thatʼs why I was arguing hard the other day for maintaining the armed forces under their present leadership. I donʼt mind if you move one or two men but not too many so we have something to fall back on once we get out. The only people we can rely on there now, Mr. President, on the Communist side are the officer corps of the Armed Forces. There just isnʼt anybody else that I was able to find down there that will give us any base at all to work against the commies in the future. Now weʼve got to do that on the one hand and on the other hand try to get them, I think we can, to quit throwing out governments that are not Communist. Weʼve got to get them to move toward democracy instead of destroying them.</p>
                        <p>President: Was there any justification for throwing out <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> [<persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Cabral</persName>]?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: No, not at all. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> took over at an impossible time from a political point of view because <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> had raised the cost—thatʼs a sugar economy—of producing sugar to somewhere around 9 cents. Some people say as high as 11. When the world price went down to 2.5 cents, he was in trouble just because he had to fire a lot of people, he had to impose austerity programs, he made the Generals mad by stopping their grafting, he made the rich mad by collecting taxes, and the poor people who donʼt understand much about this stuff only knew that times were hard. Now thatʼs what really got <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>. Heʼs a pretty decent guy. Most people that I talked to thought he had the cleanest, honest, best government theyʼve had in a long time. But, heʼs gone, and you couldnʼt bring him back. Youʼve got to start with a new face. I donʼt rule out the possibility of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> although I think that would cause great trouble with <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> is afraid of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>.</p>
                        <p>President: Why?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Everybody hates everybody down there; thatʼs the main trouble.</p>
                        <p>President: Why is <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> afraid of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Because <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> killed Trujillo and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was the Vice President under Trujillo and he thinks he [<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>] would let the Trujillistas get to him and kill him and his family.</p>
                        <p>President: How are we ever going to get <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> out of power?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Once we get the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> down to the [Dominican Republic] and we get the right political climate, I donʼt think itʼs going to be so hard Mr. President. If we donʼt rush it too fast, if we donʼt insult him <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0267"/>so he thinks his honor is involved, if we play it slowly and firmly, weʼll find a way.</p>
                        <p>President: So you think the best thing to do is to just ride it out and just say that weʼre waiting on the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Thatʼs my judgment.</p>
                        <p>President: And say that we have achieved all of our objectives up to this point; weʼve stopped the shooting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Weʼve done as much as we can to pave the way for the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. They are coming down; weʼre delighted; weʼre sort of turning over to them. This is going to work out better than most people think, I believe.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> believes he will be quite unable to accept our position or even to negotiate at length about it. But he has undertaken to speak with <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mayobre</persName> before giving a more considered answer this afternoon.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>I opened by reminding him that there had always been 3 basic issues in front of us—and that there had been no really final agreement on any of the 3. They were the need for high leaders on each side to step out and leave the country, the problem of effective dealing with Commies, and a constitutional govt with a sufficiently wide base to command general Dom confidence. I knew he had always recognized the importance of 2nd and 3rd, and equally I knew that he had never given his own approval to 1st.</p>
                                <p>I said that we had had growing concern in recent days on the role of rebel leaders and especially on the role of Commies. There had been repeated incidents suggesting the influence of forces which do not wish <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0268"/>a settlement. There had been reports from <gloss target="#t_DOMS1">Doms</gloss> of good will the influence of the Commies continued to be strong. We had growing evidence of our own that Commies were strong in the constitutionalist forces.</p>
                            </item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>I reminded <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> of our original formula that leaders should leave and that known Commies should be separated from the Dom community by detention or departure. I said that we had reported his own objections to these proposals. I said that our fundamental view now was that we did not think a constitutional govt with necessary Dom and U.S. support was possible without a public and decisive position on Commies. The only action which we could see that would show this decision plainly was the separation of those known to be tough, trained, and committed Commies, with a public announcement of this decision.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>I said all liberal non-Commie movements must eventually confront and defeat Commie threat. I knew that we both agreed on this point. In our judgment the time for this clear breach in the Dom Rep was now, and the slower and more gradual way would not meet the necessities. I said this was the only safe way to a democratic future, in the clear view of my govt, and I reported my impression that there was sympathy for this position on the part of both <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mayobre</persName>. (This is what they have told us privately, but it remains to be seen whether they will be so firm with <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>.)</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>I said that I knew this position would present a grave question for <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> in the light of his arguments of last week and that I hoped he would take time to reflect before giving a definite reply. I said that our objective was still to lay a firm basis for real agreement, and we should take all the necessary time.</p>
                                <p>I emphasized strongly our continuing conviction that constitutionalist solution was best and <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> best man to execute it. Said we were making clear again to <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> that we saw no lasting solution in him or in his group—and that this opinion too was shared by <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mayobre</persName>. We should therefore take our time and find a way to match the basic necessities of constitutional govt with basic requirements I had stated. I was sure this could be done.</p>
                            </item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> said he was deeply disillusioned but not greatly surprised. He knew that I was responsible to final authority of the President. He assumed, however, that the President would know of our discussions and conversations of last week. He recognized that there were many worries in Wash; that many people there and here believed things that were unreal. He himself recognized that there had been Commie infiltration in the constitutionalist forces. He remained persuaded that the <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> govt had very good control over its various elements. He said it was understandable that in a mood of siege there would be <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0269"/>occasional outbursts that could not be controlled, but that the basic situation was one of effective authority under <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>. He reminded me that he himself had never supported the departure of revolutionary leaders. He recognized that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> had agreed to detention or departure of Commies, but he had always opposed it.</p>
                                <p>He expressed at some length his conviction that this method was inefficient and indeed not really workable.</p>
                                <p>He then underlined his rejection of the sacrifice of leaders. He would not do it if Benitez, or <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, or the leaders themselves should ask it of him. The departure of these leaders would mean a govt without popular support. If this was required, he would expect to have to withdraw. He would still be glad to assist as a mediator and as an advisor both to us and to his fellow countrymen, but he would not expect to serve in any resulting government.</p>
                                <p>At this point, I gave him a dose of honest praise, pointing out that his integrity and independence of mind were rare qualities which he had no right to withhold from the service of his people at a time like this if a reasonable solution could be found. I thought he should be sure to talk with <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mayobre</persName> before reaching a decision and that I thought it would be very wrong for him to give a final answer now.</p>
                            </item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>He said he was willing to defer a final answer but that we should understand these were his firm principles. He believed that repression by force would simply make more Commies. He thought this was the product of earlier crude policies of the Council of State and of the triumvirate govts. He was just as concerned about Commies as we, and he was determined to have them carefully watched and controlled. But he was strongly opposed to creation of conditions that would manufacture Commies. Killing and deportation would have this effect.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>I replied that I understood and respected his own belief that one set of measures was better than another. But present circumstances had necessarily created special concerns. We both believed that what counts is results. We took no satisfaction in acts of force for their own safety. But today there was a grave question of confidence both in his country and certainly in my own. It was therefore a necessity for visible action against real Commie danger. We could find no other way that to separate hard core Commies. I drew clear distinction between student dabblers and solidly committed, trained, and disciplines revolutionaries. We thought action against the latter absolutely essential.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>We then discussed a number of other matters such as maintenance of cease-fire, fate of Radio Santo Domingo, and possibilities for econ rehabilitation while seeking POL solution. I also complained <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0270"/>about Cabinet leak to Szulc<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">Reference is to a story filed by Tad Szulc, a Washington correspondent of The New York Times who was in Santo Domingo. On May 17 at 4:45 p.m. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> telephoned Bromley Smith seeking information on this story. Smith summarized Szulcʼs article as stating <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> was the U.S. Governmentʼs candidate to lead the Dominican Republic and the <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> missionʼs purpose was to convince <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> to leave to make way for a U.S. Government “slate” under <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>.

                                <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> wound up by emphasizing great difficulty of his personal position and his view that both general situation and this personal problem made a quick decision essential. Believing this decision would be negative, I reassured him that no matter when or how discussions ended he could count on us to bear witness to his patriotism, honor and integrity. I re-emphasized that we had common objectives and urged him to make every possible effort to reconcile his purposes with the basic requirements on which we found it essential to insist.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>He then undertook to talk to <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mayobre</persName> and to give us a reply this afternoon. I said that I would take this reply not as a final answer but as a message to the President, so that both sides could be sure of full understanding of each otherʼs position. This may give us another 24 hours—but not much more.</item>

                            <item>Our lengthy discussion was quite useful in my judgment. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and company should now have clear idea of what we want and of what problems must be solved before final solution can be achieved. They can now have no illusions about the firmness of our purpose nor false optimism about a quick and easy solution. At same time, way was left open for further talks which could ultimately produce good results. <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0273"/>As a starter <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> will meet with <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> tomorrow to discuss problem of removing dangerous source of incidents by bringing National Palace within our security lines.</item>

                            <item>I opened conversation by reviewing status of our negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName>. Emphasized my respect and admiration for <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> both as person and as negotiator for Constitutionalists. Said we had been close to agreement on several occasions during past week but serious issues arose each time and we were not in position of having to step back and give careful consideration to problem as a whole. Told them I was going to Washington tomorrow<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> departed the Dominican Republic to return to Washington the morning of May 26. According to a telephone conversation that morning with Bill Moyers at 9:25 a.m. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>, who was still in Santo Domingo, reported that publicly he was returning to Washington for consultations with the President, but the private underlying reason was to try to diminish growing criticism in the press that Americans were attempting to install their own government in the Dominican Republic. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of telephone conversation between <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> and Bill Moyers, Tape F65.42, Side A, PNO 1)</note> but Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> would be here to carry on. Emphasized our deep interest in having everyone concerned make maximum use of <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> presence and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName>ʼs good offices in working toward final settlement of Dominican problem.</item>

                            <item>Listed following specific issues to be resolved: (A) constitution—we can understand deep desire on part of <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> forces for return of 1963 constitution. However, must point out that by no means all Dominicans share this desire. (B) <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> of Armed Forces—insistence that member of <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> group hold command of army remains one of principle obstacles. (C) Communism—we are satisfied that present leadership of Constitutionalist movement is against communism but there are serious differences between us on how problem should be handled. (D) Civil Base of Government—we have come a long way toward understanding on necessity for broadest possible representation in government so as to attract wide support. However, we might have to go farther. (E) <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and the Other Side—power of <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> and its forces has grown considerably during last ten days. Result has been hardening attitude on questions such as who will command army. No one now can seriously believe that a complete victory is possible for either side.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> expressed himself as shocked and disappointed at my presentation. (This appeared to be largely for benefit of <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and company. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> had not filled them in on Mondayʼs conversation—<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 1963.)<note n="3" xml:id="d96fn3">
                                    <ref target="#d94">Document 94</ref>.</note> Said he thought we had reached final agreement on constitutional formula, names of officers who would hold top military commands, including Minister Armed Forces and Army and Air Force <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0274"/>commanders, (Navy unsettled but not a particular problem) and on composition of Cabinet. This would leave as only basic problem matter of how to deal with communism. (<persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> did not mention problem of departure of rebel leaders.)</item>

                            <item>I made it entirely clear that in this, as in all diplomatic negotiations, agreement must be reached on all points in order regard any one as having been finally settled. Conceded that we had reached understanding in principle on various points at various times but obviously failure settle all issues left each side free re-examine its position as a whole.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> gave <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> the floor first. He said Constitutionalist “government” had put negotiations in hands of <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> and was fully prepared accept peaceful solution as long as it included restoration of 1963 Constitution. On that issue they would not give an inch. As for growing strength of <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> side this was clearly result of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intervention. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> could only exist with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support. If <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces would leave the country the Constitutionalists could finish the job they began April 24. Re army command, <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> group had conceded on other three military posts but would continue insist that Army <gloss target="#t_CS1">C/S</gloss> come from their ranks.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> picked up the argument in even more forceful terms: There are only two real “bands” in <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss>, Constitutionalists and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> able clear northern part of city only because <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> had divided Constitutionalist forces and because <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military had provided active assistance. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> had thought that, as matter of course, there would be cease-fire while conversations went forward. Instead on day after talks began <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> permitted <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> to attack. His forces used <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> arms and were assisted by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> helicopters, as well as by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops firing from <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>. Constitutionalists had nevertheless continued make concessions in in effort find peaceful solution. Now they were virtually being asked to surrender with demand that they give up claim to Army <gloss target="#t_CS1">C/S</gloss> post. He (<persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>) would offer his head if necessary for a real solution but would keep it tightly screwed on under present circumstances. Army <gloss target="#t_CS1">C/S</gloss> post must be filled by Constitutionalist officer.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>In reply I made following points: (A) Caamanoʼs assessment of our role here and of our relationship to <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> was quite simply wrong. I knew what orders had been given and I had confidence in the discipline of our troops. No such military cooperation with <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> had taken place. (B) Re armed forces posts, we were not talking about either side ceding or surrendering anything. Had been agreed from first with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> that Minister of Armed Forces and Army <gloss target="#t_CS1">C/S</gloss> would be officers acceptable both sides. (C) Assertion that only two sides exist also incorrect. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs side is a fact, like it or not, and it controls good part of the country.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> intervened at this juncture to suggest that continuing discussion of specific issues was unprofitable and inappropriate. We should be talking about basic positions and general attitudes. <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> also did valuable work in strengthening <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> with <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> by paying tribute to his integrity, sincerity and honest representation of Constitutionalist side. I used <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName>ʼs intervention to emphasize that my review of status of negotiations was not meant to indicate we were closing the door. Far from it. We merely saying time had come to take stock and see where we might go from here.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cury</persName> were not yet prepared let reason flow. They said only two alternatives existed: peaceful solution or total and glorious sacrifice of Constitutionalist forces in fight to the finish. Delays in negotiations suggested—at least to uniformed—that deliberate stalling tactics were being employed in hope of weakening Constitutionalist movement. Time now at hand when people should know the truth. Might even be necessary, <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> said, to tell all—who had been negotiating and what had been said.</item>

                            <item>I replied that this was up to them. We had nothing to fear. Our purpose was to seek solution in interests of all. Could only point out that type of publicity <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> suggesting would scarcely brighten prospects for further talks. As for threat to seek solution with arms, my government was committed to sustain cease-fire in accordance <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> resolution. Our forces would, of course, have to reply in kind if attacked. However, no one wanted more violence, least of all Dominican people. Courage and sense of honor of Constitutionalists might be admirable but notion of seeking glory and world sympathy by provoking fight to the end was futile because such a course would solve nothing.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>From this point on discussion became increasingly more reasonable. I said it my understanding that basic Constitutionalist position was one of opposition to dictatorship of right or left, of determination that country should have honest government responsive to peopleʼs will. I pointed out real Communist danger as we see it and emphasized that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> national interests would not permit another Cuba. Also observed that reality of Dominican situation required close and understanding relations between our two countries which, in turn, required appreciation on their part of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> responsibilities and attitudes with regard to communism. If my understanding of Constitutionalist position correct our fundamental difference was on issue of how to handle Communist problem.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> each made rather lengthy statements to effect that: Constitutionalists firmly opposed to communism and knew Communist dictatorship would be even worse than rule by the right. Constitutionalists fully recognized absolute necessity of good relations <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0276"/>with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and of economic assistance from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Constitutionalists would never permit imposition of communism here and were prepared to meet the danger. As soon as constitutional government established, Communists or anyone else who might break law or conspire would suffer full consequences. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> said we knew his history from our intelligence sources, knew him to be anti-Communist. He and his movement were out to give people free, honest government and to clean up corrupt armed forces, nothing more.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and friends conceded there were probably a few Communists around. Every popular movement could expect some infiltration. However, there were no Communists anywhere near <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>, his government or military command—of that we could be sure. He, <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>, had met only three Communists in his life—gentlemen who happened to be brought under arrest to the National Police while he was on duty there. He had heard other names mentioned but had no direct knowledge of these people. Finally, as <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cury</persName> said and others agreed, best way fight communism was to give people social justice and work.</item>

                            <item>I said our assessment of situation was quite different. Constitutionalists claimed they could handle problem and we prepared accept that this what they genuinely believe. However, we informed Communists not few and insignificant but rather numerous and active in Constitutionalist movement. These are people who have been identified to our satisfaction. They are brothers-in-arms of <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>ʼs officers. Their presence and what is to become of them are matters of real concern to us. We must be satisfied that this problem will be dealt with effectively and must have clear understanding on that point in order go ahead toward solution.</item>

I replied present large meeting no place go into specifics on such delicate subject but perhaps <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> would wish designate officer (one clearly identified as anti-Communist) who could hold discussions with one of our people. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> accepted suggestion.

                            <item>Talk then turned to basic attitude of Constitutionalists toward concept of national concord and kind of government that might achieve it. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> said his side already committed to policy of no revenge and he reluctantly prepared allow “guilty” San Isidro officers leave country without answering for their crimes. Entire <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> group next took turns presenting case for their contention that fight to restore 1963 Constitution has full support of Dominican people. In essence argument was that installation of government in accordance that documentʼs provisions would end all problems and be greeted with <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0277"/>universal joy. I again noted differences in our assessment of Dominican reality, pointing out that majority of Dominican people have not really been heard from; that opposition to Constitutionalist solution does exist in important sectors; and that <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>ʼs group must think in terms of broader solution than merely going back to Constitution 1963—of practical steps to create a genuine government of national concord.</item>

Specifically mentioned in this connection is Dr. Marcio Mejia Ricart, a prominent Dominican Communist who is an economics professor. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is said to be quite close to Mejia Ricart, who exerts great influence over <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs economic line of thought. This individualʼs influence is probably indirectly increased by the fact that Mejia Ricart also is the ideological mentor of other persons whom <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> respects. In the latter category are Guatemalans Doctor Raul Osegueda and Mario Monteforte Toledo, who are violently anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intellectuals of a far leftist stripe.

These men, who are brothers, have been identified as top rebel leaders in the current revolt.

                            <item>Most Central American and Dominican Communists who have known <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> over the years have regarded him as a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] political lightweight at home and unworthy of serious attention. Jose Manuel Fortuny, a Guatemalan Communist leader who played a key role in the Arbenz government (1951–54), knew <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> during this period and considered him [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] not anti-Communist and a person who could be won over. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], during his many years of exile in Central America and the Caribbean, sought on several occasions to pass himself off as solidly pro-Communist in hopes of <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0281"/>winning Communist support for an anti-Trujillo move of some kind. Most of the Communists whom he tried to impress with this pose saw through it, however.

He would like to be another Arevalo insofar as his style of governing is concerned, but he fell short of this goal because he is “too sentimental and too ultrademocratic.” He is also the type of person who thinks that if the people ask for Communism, then Communism is what they should get. But from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> point of view, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] that perhaps the most dangerous thing about <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is the anti-American, ultranationalist nature of some of his friends.</item>

                            <item>One of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs Guatemalan friends—Monteforte Toledo—is said to have learned that the Communist element within the Dominican rebel movement plans to take advantage of the “clumsy Yankee intervention” in the Dominican Republic to build strength for a later takeover. According to this plan, the Communists are holding onto their weapons and will bide their time until the crisis has ended. Then they intend to launch an attack against whatever government exists and quickly seize power before there is time for international reaction to mobilize itself against it. These tactics are described [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] as typical of the Communists—namely the development of a campaign of terror and internal conflict throughout the country in order to accomplish what cannot be done directly through an open military revolt.</item>

                        <p>The Rebel insurrection in Santo Domingo against the government of <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Donald Reid Cabral</persName> began on Saturday, April 24, 1965. The Dominican Revolutionary Party (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>) seized control and appointed Rafael Molina Urena as President.</p>
                        <p>During the next days, the situation became increasingly chaotic. On April 26, Loyalist forces bombed the Rebel-held areas in Santo Domingo. The Rebel government head, Molina, took refuge in the Colombian Embassy. Although the bombing lasted only one day, the situation continued to deteriorate rapidly. Other early leaders of the Rebels began to seek refuge in foreign embassies. Extremist groups moved quickly to the ranks of the Rebels. Leaders of the communist and pro-communist parties became involved with the Rebels and assisted in collecting arms, organizing forces, and setting up strong points in Santo Domingo. As the Rebels gained control of more arms and ammunition, thousands of irresponsible civilians were given weapons.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. build-up paralleled these events. On April 24, the Caribbean Ready Amphibious Squadron, with its 1,830 Marines, was directed to move to and stand off the Dominican coast. On April 26, two Army battalions of the 82d Airborne Division were alerted. On April 27, the amphibious squadron was ordered to begin the evacuation. On that day 1,176 Americans and other foreign nationals were evacuated out of the port of Haina. On April 28, the situation was so chaotic that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> requested the landing of Marines to protect the evacuation operations and reinforce the Embassy guard.<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">See <ref target="#d32">Document 32</ref>.</note> In response, 400 Marines were sent ashore. On April 29, the Ambassador requested that the remainder of the Marine units and the two Army battalions be moved to the Dominican Republic to protect American lives.<note n="3" xml:id="d99fn3">See <ref target="#d41">Document 41</ref>.</note> On April 30, 1,500 Marines landed and established <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0283"/>positions around the Ambassador Hotel (the assembly point for evacuees) and secured the road to the port of Haina. On the same day, 1,800 Army troops landed at the San Isidro airfield.</p>
                        <p>Despite the signing of a cease-fire agreement at 5:30 p.m. on April 30, sporadic but frequent sniping continued from the Rebel side; and in less than 36 hours, 3 soldiers and Marines had been killed and 15 had been wounded. As a Rebel shortwave transmitter broadcast instructions to the civilian mobs to shoot Americans on sight and Radio Havana exhorted the Rebels to “fight on,” the remaining seven battalions of the 82d Airborne Division were placed in an increased readiness status. The danger to American lives continued; and with the Rebels in control of Radio Santo Domingo—the only effective communication with the rest of the island—the danger of chaos and anarchy throughout the island increased, with its accompanying danger to American and other lives and property.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, 400 Army troops landed late on May 1 at San Isidro, about 10 miles east of Santo Domingo. 1,600 more Army troops arrived early on May 2. They secured the San Isidro airfield, the Duarte Bridge at the east entrance of Santo Domingo, and part of the east bank of the Ozama River on the eastern side of Santo Domingo. On May 1, an International Safety Zone was established within Santo Domingo with U.S. troops to protect it. By the end of May 2, about 1,700 more Army troops and 1,000 Marines were landed at San Isidro and Haina to secure the Duarte Bridge and the road to the airport, and to reinforce and hold the International Safety Zone. By this time, over 3,000 persons had been evacuated from Santo Domingo. The build-up continued on May 3, 4, and 5, with supporting elements arriving until May 14. By May 14, there were approximately 21,000 U.S. Armed Forces personnel on the island; 5,945 Marines, 14,200 Army, and 958 Air Force.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Need for 21,000 Men</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To appreciate the need for 21,000 men ashore, three major factors must be considered: the missions of the U.S. forces, the geographical location and population density of the areas in which they were required to perform those missions, and the explosive political situation.</p>
                        <p>The initial mission of the U.S. forces on April 28 was to evacuate U.S. nationals whose lives were in danger. By April 29, the mission was expanded to include the evacuation of other foreign nationals and the reinforcement of the U.S. Embassy guard which was under attack by Rebel snipers. Marines were required to insure the safety of the evacuees from the assembly point at the Ambassador Hotel on the western edge of Santo Domingo to the port of Haina 7 miles away. On April 29, additional troops were needed—and requested by the American Ambassador—to protect American lives in Santo Domingo and the surrounding area. On May 1, an International Safety Zone was established <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0284"/>in densely populated, downtown Santo Domingo to provide a secure area for <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and other peacekeeping authorities, to protect various foreign embassies (some of which had been violated by Rebel forces), and to protect Dominicans and Americans and other foreign nationals. Establishment and maintenance of this zone (identified on the attached map),<note n="4" xml:id="d99fn4">Not attached.</note> together with the need to assure the safe movement of people and supplies over the 7 miles of road from Santo Domingo to the landing, supply, and evacuation point at the port of Haina, required approximately 6,000 Marines, with an additional force of 2,000 Marines off the shore of the International Safety Zone to meet unexpected contingencies.</p>
                        <p>The missions of the Army airborne troops have been to protect American lives throughout the island, to assist (with the Marines) in the restoration of law and order, to separate opposing Rebel and Loyalist forces, and to protect the lifeline of medicine, food, and other essential supplies from San Isidro to Santo Domingo.</p>
                        <p>The airborne units landed at San Isidro airfield, which is 10 miles east of Santo Domingo. The initial increments of these forces first secured the airfield for future landings of troops, supplies, food, and medicine, then moved to secure the vital Duarte Bridge and the east bank of the Ozama River on the eastern side of Santo Domingo. Subsequent increments of Army forces were needed to protect and keep open the 10-mile road from the San Isidro airfield to Santo Domingo so that men and essential supplies could move swiftly and safely.</p>
                        <p>Three airborne battalions, totaling 4,416 men, have been required to secure the eastern bank of the Ozama River, including the Duarte Bridge, and the 10-mile road from San Isidro airfield to Santo Domingo on a 24-hour basis. Three other airborne battalions, another 4,416 men, have been required to secure the airfield at Santo Domingo, to be available to protect American lives and property, and to assist in restoring law and order on behalf of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> throughout the remainder of the country in the event the rebellion should spread. An additional 1,809 Army and Air Force personnel have been required to support the intensive air operations at San Isidro airfield and to provide the other services needed to maintain our forces in the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>Originally, it was hoped that Loyalist Dominican forces would be able to maintain order in a corridor between the U.S. Marines on the eastern boundary of the International Safety Zone and the U.S. Army forces 2 miles away on the east bank of the Ozama River. It became apparent, however, that the Loyalist forces would not be able to do so. Accordingly, additional Army troops were required to establish and <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0285"/>hold a corridor approximately 4 blocks wide and almost 2 miles long in a densely populated section of the city of Santo Domingo. Initially, this corridor was established by house-to-house fighting through Rebel-held portions of Santo Domingo. Eventually the corridor became (as it now is) the line separating the opposing Rebel and Loyalist forces, and the key to the maintenance of the cease-fire.</p>
                        <p>U.S. Army troops in the corridor not only perform the mission of separating the opposing Dominican forces, but also search all traffic crossing the corridor to prevent the passage of arms and ammunition from one side to the other. The corridor serves as a route for the transport of food, supplies, and medicine to the International Safety Zone and the rest of Santo Domingo. Three airborne battalions, totaling 4,416 men, have been required to accomplish these missions in the corridor on a 24-hour basis.</p>
                        <p>During the entire period U.S. forces, in conjunction with interested U.S. agencies, have furnished increasing levels of humanitarian support to the suffering Dominican people and their ravaged economy. Military vehicles, helicopters, and personnel have been used unsparingly in the distribution of more than 8 million pounds of food. Military technicians have directly contributed to the initiation of public works projects which, in the process of revitalizing the Republicʼs economy, have provided employment for over 4,000 Dominican nationals. Another 15,000 Dominicans have been treated in U.S. military medical facilities.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the performance of their missions, our forces have been, and still are, subjected to sporadic but frequent sniper fire. From April 30, the date of the cease-fire, to May 25, 18 U.S. military personnel have been killed and 100 have been wounded.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the missions our troops have been required to perform have been complex and have increased from the first landing of Marines on April 28 to the present. The initial mission of evacuating American citizens was expanded within a day to include the evacuation of other foreign nationals. Subsequently, our forces established an International Safety Zone in the heart of Santo Domingo and provided food and medicine for thousands of Dominicans, and Americans and other foreign nationals, as well as themselves. These missions have been performed over an area stretching from Haina, 7 miles west of Santo Domingo, through the heart of the densely populated city, to the San Isidro airfield, 10 miles east of Santo Domingo. Humanitarian missions such as the supply of food, medical care, and other essentials, have been performed throughout the Republic. Finally, and perhaps most important, these functions have been performed in an unusually explosive political situation involving continuous sniping, bitter Dominican factions, and communists and other extremists—a situation <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0286"/>in which our men may be called on at any time for peace-keeping activities and the protection of life and property throughout the entire country.</p>

                            <item>Concern and at least beginning of initiative now visible on part civic leaders Santo Domingo, Santiago, and other towns may offer a way out of this squalid mess. People now beginning to mobilize themselves, while largely middle road to conservative in their personal viewpoints, represent broad base of opinion which is essentially apolitical and emphatically rejects extremes of both left and right.

                                <p>If I may speak bluntly, and with some oversimplification, I view two contending sides at present as follows:</p>
                                <p>With <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> group we are dealing with a bunch of hoodlums infiltrated and fortified by Communists whose presence they unwilling admit. One hears names of legitimate <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> people who have swung <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0287"/>back to them now, but people who visit headquarters such as Papal Nuncio and others do not see them about. (Pena Gomez spoke at <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> rally yesterday; all other speakers were from extreme left ([<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] special report 268<note n="3" xml:id="d100fn3">Not found.</note>).) Nuncio, who worked as hard and as generously as anyone with rebels, in earlier days, told me this morning he considered “worst elements” have gained ascendancy in <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> movement. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> generally discounted.</p>

                            <item>As regards <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>, the gangster side of his nature has surged rapidly to fore as he has felt himself more pressed. He is getting advice from, among others, old Trujillo types whom I find as unacceptable to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests as extreme left elements downtown. While rising hysteria over communism has brought some worthy people to his group, his popular support seems largely artificially pumped up. Recent events have drawn armed forces behind him, but they are not naturally his allies and residue of distrust remains. Certainly Postigo, and probably Grisolia and Benoit, could be pulled away from him for better alternative (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 2080).<note n="4" xml:id="d100fn4">Telegram 2080 from Santo Domingo, May 29, transmitted the views of moderate <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> junta members Julio D. Postigo and Carlos Grisolia who met with Embassy officials on the night of May 28. Both junta members expressed their disillusionment with the <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss>, and Postigo expressed hope of leaving the <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> while Grisolia disagreed with the concessions granted to the rebels in the name of neutrality.

                            <item>It seems to me we have made a good record of trying to work honorably with both contending forces and we have tenaciously sought compromise solution. While some minor concessions have been achieved, neither side has shown itself willing to seek honorable compromise. Situation is declining again with danger of polarization, and perhaps time has come to soft pedal them both and seek middle way.</item>

                            <item>A good bit depends on how much influence we now wish give <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>. Washington will have to weigh wider considerations, but from purely local point of view he no longer needs be given great weight. Our numerous surveys of opinion in recent days in lower middle class and poor areas, both in town and country, seldom if ever turned up name of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, nor <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>, nor <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>. Venezuelan Ambassador, who cannot be described as unfriendly to democratic left, this week called <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> “political cadaver,” and Papal Nuncio, who came back here at urging of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> to seek settlement, agrees. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would seem have more general strength.</item>

                            <item>If a middle way can be found, we would still have problems of <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> hard cores. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> may be somewhat difficult dislodge at this stage, but believe it could be worked out. While there is no doubt some serious hard core with <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>, believe that if cultivation of vine were stopped, movement would wither.

                            <item>A further point: in conversations with <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> over past 36 hours, <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> has indicated that he does not think it is possible to bring the two contending sides together on a formula on which both can agree. <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> states that from his talks with business and professional people and the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, it is becoming increasingly evident to him that responsible elements desire a solution quite apart from the <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> factions. (Papal Nuncio told me this morning middle way solution could count on strong church support behind scenes; it is responsive to recent letter of bishops). <persName corresp="#p_MOJ1">Mora</persName> is groping for what the formula might be. His current very tentative thinking is that perhaps he should make a recommendation to the <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss> setting forth principles which would serve as a guide in developing a third formula solution. He would like to get <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss> approval of the guidelines and with that in hand proceed to put the formula into effect, giving both <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> the opportunity to accept it or face the alternative of <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> action against them.</item>

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> introduced a discussion on the problem of an interim provisional government in the Dominican Republic with particular reference to when the United States would lose control of the situation and when, therefore, general election should be held. It was debated inconclusively as to whether sixty or ninety days would be too soon and whether some provisional arrangement should be established which would hold off elections for six months or so. There was concern expressed that an election coming too soon might give skilled Communist agitators the edge in a campaign. It was conceded that no one had any very clear idea on who the candidate would be or what their election prospects were.</item>

He said that he was now convinced that the establishment of a <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> government would have been a disaster. He repeated that he had the gravest misgivings about <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and his followers.</item>

                            <item>I have reached conclusion that about only way to break present political impasse here and restore a measure of harmony is to let people decide for themselves through free and open elections supervised by <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and the formation in the meantime of a provisional government of technicians who, governing under an institutional act with strong <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> support, could take country to elections. This formula should attract broad popular support in DomRep and international acceptance. I am working in this direction in Ad Hoc committee<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">On June 2 a resolution establishing an Ad Hoc Committee, composed of Ambassador Ilmar Penna Marinho of Brazil, Ambassador Ramon de Clairmont Duenas of El Salvador, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> of the United States, was adopted at the Tenth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics in Washington. This committee was to continue the efforts of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Special Committee to help find a solution to the Dominican crisis, to guide the Inter-American Peace Force, and to report to the Tenth Meeting as events arose in the Republic.</note> and I am hopeful that my Brazilian and Salvadorean colleagues will accept this formula.</item>

                            <item>Our prognosis is that electoral formula as I conceive it will not be acceptable to either <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and that opposition of former will probably be stronger than that of latter, making it necessary for us to proceed without <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> consent and very possibly against their determined, active opposition.</item>

                            <item>Returning to USUNʼs cable, foregoing prospect raises in my opinion need to begin planning now how we can best deal with pressure for additional UN involvement anticipated in USUNʼs message. I recognize that given attitudes in UNSC this not easy assignment. Task of putting through electoral-provisional government-institutional act formula is going to be difficult enough without increased UN involvement here. This particularly true when involvement is in hands of a representative like <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mayobre</persName> who is so clearly inclined toward camp which is likely to oppose our peacekeeping efforts most vigorously, with possible renewal of the hostilities and/or widespread demonstrations and protests which USUN says will immediately trigger pressure for greater UN intervention.</item>

                            <item>I trust that every effort will be made with sympathetic governments on UNSC, as well as with UN-SYG, to keep UN involvement from going beyond already uncomfortable level.</item>

For example, credit is generally tighter than it was, but probably not much tighter than it ought to be. The port of entry problem is difficult but not insoluble. Major export activity is still going on.</p>
                                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yarmolinsky</persName> said that, from an economic point of view, it is possible to operate the country for many months without the use of the rebel-held area. While Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM1">Solomon</persName> agreed that the country could probably limp along for some time, there would be an unusually large number of people unemployed and there would be a heavy burden on <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0296"/>us. He added that the major offices downtown contain the books and records, and when a business does not have books and records, it is going to do less business. For example, banks will only make loans they are sure of; they will be very careful if they donʼt know what people owe them.</p>
                                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM1">Solomon</persName> noted that the Embassy had recommended that the U.S. consider supplying Dominican business concerns with working capital. Both he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yarmolinsky</persName> disagreed with this recommendation and felt that, instead, we should broaden guarantees to banks and push them harder to make loans. The U.S. should not start lending working capital. This would be a Pandoraʼs Box; among other things, it would permit people to stay in business and send their own money out of the country. In this regard, there is a significant flow of money out of the country as well as a disturbing flow of people out of the country (400 per day).</p>

                                            <hi rend="italic">The Public Sector</hi>—There was considerable discussion about the problem of paying government servants on June 15. During the discussion, the following dimensions to the problem were noted: <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, the total payroll is about 12 million pesos a month to 100,000 people (after the meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM1">Solomon</persName> said the figure is probably closer to 90,000). <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> is now collecting between 5 and 7 million pesos of revenue per month. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, normal revenue is between 12 and 15 million pesos per month. <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, last month we were paying full salaries; the average full salary is something below 200 pesos a month (after the meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM1">Solomon</persName> said the figure is probably around 150 pesos a month).</p>
                                        <p>The group discussed at length the question of what to pay government workers on June 15—nothing, one-half salary, a flat 50 pesos, full salary; the group finally decided, after much pulling and hauling, to pay the workers nothing on June 15 and to take another look at the problem in a few daysʼ time. There were a multitude of considerations raised, such as the following: <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, nothing terrible will happen if there is a delay; the workers are accustomed to irregular payment. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, we should wait to see what <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> is going to do on pay day. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, a delay with a partial payment at a later date (or, for that matter, no payment at all) might increase the pressures for the government workers to get behind an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> political solution. <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, the people are not working and, in general, it is bad practice to pay people for nothing.</p>
                                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yarmolinsky</persName> favored an attempt to take <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs revenue away from him; it would weaken <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> politically. The group did not agree. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM1">Solomon</persName> noted that one would need a huge administrative machine to do this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> did not favor rocking the boat this hard at a time when <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> was approaching the time for decision. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said that this step is not crucial to controlling <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> at this time; we <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0297"/>have other and stronger forms of leverage in getting <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> to go along with an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> political solution.</p>

                                    <item>The group agreed that there ought to be a reinstatement of the 1963 Constitution—with the controversial parts of it suspended until the people have had a chance to make a judgment on them. As a general rule, we should try to use as much of the downtown program as possible; while this will not be enough to win over the more extreme rebels, it will tend to bring some of the moderates along with an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> solution.</item>

Most of the group disagreed with this timing. Generally speaking, the group doubted that a provisional government could hang together that long, even with an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> presence. In this regard, the group agreed that, whatever the length of time of a provisional government, there should be an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> presence which would be sufficient to keep the military in the barracks.</item>

Names which occur to us offhand as well known to Embassy are Alejandro Gruillon, Rafael Herrera, Nicolas Pichardo, Bishop Polanco and Tomas Pastoriza. You will undoubtedly have other individuals in mind as well. In reference to cabinet, there may be some advantage in moving toward a consensus in selecting names which are respected by all groups even though they do have some political affiliation.

                            <item>Composition of either type government at cabinet level and below will present obvious difficulties given human resources on which Dominican nation may call. Many of these officials will probably require technical support, regardless of type of government which eventually emerges. Question: Should <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> offer and/or attempt to provide this technical support or should other <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> member governments be called upon? We tend towards latter course because: (a) if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> technicians are provided, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will bear ultimate blame for inability to “solve” long list of insoluble problems <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> faces; and (b) a truly <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> “solution” to current crisis should have as much <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> flavor as possible.</item>

Require your comments on these alternatives. In meantime we will draft possible basic law using 1963 Constitution as point of departure.</item>

Individual officers will require special treatment such as assignment or leave outside country. Query: Should efforts towards restructuring of Dominican military establishment be held in abeyance pending inauguration of elected government, or will it be feasible to begin this task earlier?</item>

Hopefully, once provisional government is established, non-Communist elements in the rebel group will find solution sufficiently attractive to cease organized resistance. We should be thinking now of proposals that can be made to non-Communist rebels to encourage them to accept provisional government including guarantees against reprisals if they remain in country, and safe departure for those who wish to leave. Best argument with rebels will be that they will have their chance to participate in free and fair elections. It will also be helpful to be able to show clear path to constitutional government and respect for as much as possible of 1963 constitution. We also believe there should be room in provisional government for non-Communists who have been sympathetic to rebels if they wish to serve.</item>

                            <item>Provisional government should be committed to deal effectively with Communist problem. The most important single safeguard for dealing with Communists is solid agreement on cooperation between provisional government and <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> experts with whom in turn our experts could cooperate. This close cooperation in identification and surveillance of Communists is an indispensable requirement for us. Within this cooperation, two steps are involved: (a) agreement should be reached on the definition of “a Communist”; and (b) agreement should be reached on method of dealing with individuals so identified. On question of definition, we tend towards identifying Communists as members or known collaborators with <gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_PSPD1">PSPD</gloss>, and extreme left wing of 14th of June movement. Provisional government should consult with <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> on this. On question of disposition, our position is that Communists should be allowed to depart country voluntarily. We also believe those unwilling to go voluntarily should be rounded up and deported to a country of their choice provided arrangements can be made for their entry into country of choice. Otherwise, they should be sent wherever they will be accepted. But we repeat that this particular preferred solution is less important than basic pattern of cooperation on this problem.</item>

                            <item>A solution firmly based on free and honest elections open to all would seem to have best chance of success. Lack of identifiable national consensus makes it difficult for <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> to sponsor formula based on delivering power for any significant period of time to any particular individuals or groups, no matter how apparently apolitical they might be. On the other hand, <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> is in strong position to propose an electoral solution. It can draw on precedent of 1962 elections in making claim to possessing capability and prestige necessary to organize and guarantee genuinely free elections.

                            <item>I believe initial emphasis in committeeʼs proposals should therefore be on elections. Agree that satisfactory interim govt is high priority but believe groundwork can best be laid by obtaining widest possible understanding and agreement that basic solution will be reached through elections. Fear attempt push ahead and create yet another provisional govt without first establishing this principle would embroil committee in same disputes over personalities and politics that have plagued previous efforts in that direction.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>In my judgment <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> proposal for elections must be highly specific to be credible. Plan should emphasize major role of <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> in setting up machinery and creating proper climate for holding genuinely free elections. Preparations, such as establishment of new <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> electoral commission, should get under way soonest. Above all, proposal must envisage completion of electoral process within time span sufficiently short to convince Dom political groups and people as a whole that this is not just another scheme to postpone the day of reckoning indefinitely. In my judgment this means an electoral date set between six and nine months from now. Anything further off would, I fear, fail inspire confidence among <gloss target="#t_DOMS1">Doms</gloss> who are inclined to suspect that any provisional government will want to become entrenched.</item>

                            <item>In putting forward this proposal for elections, committee would at same time stress importance immediate establishment provisional government for interim period. To provide interim govt with necessary legal authority, and in order hold constitutional issue in abeyance, committee has been thinking of an “institutional act” spelling out governmental administrative prerogatives and functions. Drafting of such a document would not be overly difficult given substantial areas of agreement in this field between 1962 and 1963 constitutions. We would anticipate committee asking group of prominent Dom lawyers to sit down with <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> legal experts in order work out details. Deptʼs promised draft of “basic law” should be most helpful that regard.</item>

                            <item>Given foregoing assumptions, <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> can well take position that interim govt should logically be apolitical in character, with emphasis on technical capacity. As matter of procedure, committee could first ask broadly representative group of <gloss target="#t_DOMS1">Doms</gloss> to meet with them and work out composition of caretaker regime. My colleagues and I have been collecting suitable names and should be prepared issue invitations just as soon as <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> electoral plan is on the table.</item>

                            <item>My prognosis is that resistance to plan will be strong from both sides. We can expect <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and company to reject it out of hand. However, emphasis on elections as only fair and practical way out of impasse should result in gradual erosion of domestic and internal support for their position. Goal would be to reduce group in large measures to hard-core extremists. I see no alternative but to go ahead on assumption moderates in rebel camp will come around sooner or later.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and his hard-line following can also be expected to make considerable trouble. Zellerʼs speech yesterday (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 2378)<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">In telegram 2378 from Santo Domingo, June 12, <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> reported that in Zeller Coccoʼs speech he indicated “renewed indications of <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> frustration,” principally that of <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss>ʼs “forced inability attack rebel stronghold” “which is shielded by foreign ‘Cordon Sanitaire.’” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–9 DOM REP)</note> makes it clear they mean to insist that <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> must stay in office until an elected government is installed. Extremely strong pressure will be required to break this position and I am not completely confident at this point that Ambs Penna Marinho and Clairmont Duenas are prepared to go along with the rough tactics we will probably need to employ, since they seem to have become increasingly impressed by <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and his approach to free elections.

                            <item>In conclusion I would like to stress one point which appears to me fundamental. We cannot expect to manage the outcome of this affair as we might like. Attitudes and prejudices of my <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> colleagues, to say nothing of numerous other factors outside our control, will play too large a part. Best we can do—and we mean to do it—is assure that solution meets basic requirements of the national interest.</item>

                                <p>Question of target date for elections covered in our <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss>. We have not reached firm conclusion on best method of handling constitutional issue within electoral framework. Separate elections for Constituent Assembly prior to general elections do not, however, appear desirable under existing circumstances. Interim government is likely to be weak and assembly might well provide focus for agitation against it. Confusion as to where ultimate authority lay would also arise. If vote for Assembly did not indicate clear national consensus, country could again become caught up in bitter constitutional controversy without any better prospect of a final decision than we now have.</p>
                                <p>Other possibilities are: a. the 1962 formula of convoking Congress as a National Assembly after elections but prior to presidential inauguration; b. holding separate Assembly elections under the “institutional act” after inauguration of an elected govt; c. allowing the elected Congress to resolve the problem as it saw fit. As in 1962 (a) appears simplest and cleanest but (b) or (c) might represent wiser approach now.</p>

As Dept will readily appreciate, however, establishment of new interim govt will not of itself solve these problems. They will persist as long as rebels keep city of Santo Domingo divided and country as a whole on edge of political turmoil. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and company have made it abundantly clear that they are no more prepared to accept “middle way” or “third-force” regime of type proposed by various civic groups than they were to accept <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>.

(<persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> privately told <persName corresp="#p_SHW1">Shlaudeman</persName> yesterday: “You could pick any constitution, call it the Constitution of 1963 and it would be acceptable.”) It has been converted by rebel propaganda into a “mystique” which in minds <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> followers really means economic and social justice. I do not believe it advantageous, as Dept suggests, to accept that 1962 constitution is still in effect. I believe preferable to adopt attitude that constitutional issue remains to be resolved by the people in a free vote.</item>

                            <item>Agree that 1963 Constitution would not at this point be acceptable.

                            <item>As indicated <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss>, my view is that best way out of constitutional morass would be promulgation of “institutional act” on basis of which interim government could administer country.

                            <item>I doubt that efforts restructure military establishment would meet with much success under present circumstances. Use of kind of pressure necessary to force significant changes would only drive military back into <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs arms and present <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> with solid front in support of <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> as presently constituted. In any case, ranking military may now be dug in so far as to make real changes impossible until this crisis has passed.

                            <item>Agree that guarantee of free elections with way clearly open to restoration of constitutional, democratic government represents best possible appeal to rebels. I am not, however, overly sanguine about quick collapse of rebel movement under any circumstances except application of force. Believe substantial defections will occur as fact that <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0306"/>reasonable alternative is available sinks in. However, hard core of movement is made up of extremists, armed youngsters, and bitter men of one kind or another who seem convinced they little or nothing to lose by going on to the end. Prevalence also of romantic vision of revolution and willingness to go on even in a “lost cause” is psychological factor to take into account. Concept is obviously irrational but we believe it must be recognized as obstacle to peaceful solution.</item>

It would be helpful to give certain Congressmen a full rundown on the problem, including the whole spectrum of classified documents, FBI reports,<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> reports, etc. The President expressed reluctance on this plan. In general, we should be careful of investigations; investigators have a vested interest in finding fault. Congressmen should not get information acquired from wire taps; they will make wire taps the issue. Congressmen wonʼt keep quiet on sensitive matters; they are liable to get sources killed. In sum, the President said that Congress should not get access to raw data and should get only summaries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> added that, whatever we give to the Congress, it should be very hard information.

                                <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, in addition to a consensus in favor of a single executive, there is a general consensus in favor of delaying elections. The best plan seems to be the establishment of a Provisional Government, followed by a “cooling-off” period for 6 months; a constituent assembly would then follow in 3 more months which, in turn, would be followed by a campaign for elections. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, there are indications that most Dominicans donʼt want the <gloss target="#t_IAF1">IAF</gloss> to remain in the Dominican Republic for too long. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> suggested that the <gloss target="#t_IAF1">IAF</gloss> pull out 3 to 6 months after the Provisional Government is formed. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, there are indications that the non-Communists in the Dominican Republic donʼt understand the Communist-front system; it is going to be very important to get a good non-Communist as President. Also, the rebels want the 14th of June people to participate in the elections and will probably reject any efforts to deport Communists from the country. <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, the rebels want to reinstate military people who have been cashiered since 1963. This would probably include Communists, as well as some of the old, corrupt generals. This is clearly unacceptable. <hi rend="italic">Fifth</hi>, <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> has not said anything about the control of the armed forces.

                        <p>2570. 1. Following presentation this morning by <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> group of their reply to committee plan,<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">On June 23 at 10 a.m. the Ad Hoc Committee and the Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> received the “Constitutionalist Governmentʼs” 7-page written reply to the Committeeʼs June 18 proposal (see <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>) for a solution to the Dominican crisis. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName>, Anibal Campagna, Arevalo Cedeno, Alfredo Conde, Salvador Blanco, <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Hector Aristy</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Jottin Cury</persName> signed the reply on behalf of the “Constitutionalist Government.” The demands were: a reassertion that the U.S. military intervention was an illegal act; a condemnation of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> for ratifying the U.S. action; a call for the evacuation of the Inter-American Peace Force within 1 month of the installation of the Provisional Government; an insistence that the weapons controlled by its irregular forces be turned into the Provisional Government rather than to the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>; an insistence that all regular military personnel on its side, as well as those who were dismissed after the September 1963 coup against <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>, be reinstated in their previous ranks, and a proposal that the “Institutional Act” be ratified by the “constitutionalist” congress. For text, see <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Chronicle</hi>, Vol. 1–2, 1965–1967 (Washington, D.C.: Pan American Union, August 1965), pp. 32–38.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> and I went for private talk with <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>. Our purpose was to advise him that reply had been received from other side and to talk with him regarding personal contribution he now in position to make to help in achieving settlement of Dominican crisis.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> indicated he had had advance word of Caamanoʼs reply and in brief comment asserted seemingly forthcoming attitude by “constitutionalists” was only a tactic to gain time. He said <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> reply would be ready for presentation to Ad Hoc Committee at meeting scheduled for 4 pm today.<note n="3" xml:id="d111fn3">The afternoon of June 23 the Ad Hoc Committee and the Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> met with the “Government of National Reconstruction” and received a 4-page written reply of that government to the Committeeʼs June 18 proposal. The <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss>ʼs key points included the following: a call for elections to be held in 9 months, subject to postponement by the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>; the departure of the Inter-American Peace Force as soon as a plan is adopted; the exclusion of amnesty for common crimes unrelated to acts of war; the stipulation that only the military who did not violate the military code of justice be allowed to return to their barracks; arms surrendered to the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> be transferred to the Dominican Armed Forces within 15 days of collection; the desirability of all Communists to leave the country; the approval of the concept of the “Institutional Act”; the installation of the constitution before the elected government takes office; the urgency of returning Santo Domingo to normalcy and allowing the government to exercise police functions, and the reservation of the right to modify its position. (Ibid., pp. 38–41)</note> He did not attempt to anticipate discussion in <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> document and mentioned only one point, arguing that a constitution should be drawn up before elections are held. He expressed <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0312"/>opinion that Constituent Assembly provides an opportunity to measure popular and party feelings before elections and avoids danger, as with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, of winning party then writing its own constitution.</p>
                        <p>3. We then got on to subject of visit. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> spoke first, stressing <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> respect for <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> as Dominican patriot who twice has stepped forward in moments of crisis to save his country, first against Trujillo and now against Communist threat. He would always deserve gratitude of his people for these acts and he would always enjoy high reputation in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> for them. Now he was being called on to make a further sacrifice, i.e., voluntarily to renounce his position as chief of <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> and give way to broader-based provisional government which could repair deep cleavages in Dominican society and take country to elections. Such a gesture on his part at this time would be act of highest patriotism and would enshrine his name in Dominican history.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> was obviously caught by surprise at this approach but recovered quickly and began to stress his own patriotic motives. He had assumed power for two reasons, and two only; one, his love of country, and two, because the United States, the country for which he has had life-long admiration above all others, had asked him to step forward, he “hates” politicians who have brought nothing but misery to country and looks forward to nine months of administration before elections as opportunity to clean house and to make a real fight on corruption which is such an enervating influence in this country. His own desire, he asserted with emphasis, is for real democratic government.</p>
                        <p>5. I then spoke in support of <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> approach, putting remarks in personal framework. I reviewed events of critical days of late April and recalled very real contribution <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> had made in keeping country from falling apart. I remembered his assistance in sending men from his own troops to guard foreign embassies which were in great danger of mob violence after police protection had dissolved. There was no doubt he had held the pass at critical moment and he would always be remembered and honored by my country for it. We had gone through two very hard months here and now we had arrived at new situation; an outstanding committee representing the entire hemisphereʼs concern in the Dominican situation was here finding a solution. Danger of Communist take-over, concern over which had brought him to fore, was not averted, and we could depend on committee to find reasonable solution with guarantees against Communists. Having saved his country for second time, progress of events now permitted his return to private life. This would not only be act of high patriotism and self-abnegation but in my convinced opinion it would serve his own personal interests best. He knew Dominican history better than I, and its tragic course in that even good men in power had never known how or when to step down. Even a leader so recent as <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Donald Reid</persName>
                            <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0313"/>had lost his footing largely because of public suspicions over his desire to continue. He, <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>, had opportunity to serve his own interests as well as nationʼs by bowing out with appropriate statement and resuming his honored position as Dominican patriot anxious only for welfare of country as a whole. He could now with confidence leave the details to the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>; his mission was accomplished. Shades of Duarte, San <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName> and Cincinnatus as well were invoked during this part of our conversation.</p>
                        <p>6. While <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> was noticeably moved by these two approaches, neither really convinced him. He came back to associate himself with national destiny and to stress his own high moral worth (all this said with the sincerity of a man who believes strongly in his own star) as compared with nearly all other Dominicans. To retire at this critical junction would be to “run away” before the problem is solved. Among other evidence, recently intercepted correspondence of Pablo Mella “proved” the link of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> with Communists and <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and his group were <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs stooges. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> said he could not leave now but we knew he wanted to work with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in every way. Just tell him which people to put in the government and it would be done. His only purpose of staying was to get the government going and give the country honest administration until election time. He would not leave except under force since that was the only kind of departure which would make it possible for him to live with his children in good conscience. He went on to say that all Dominicans knew that he is firmly committed to the United States and they know why he is in power today. He asserted parenthetically that at the time his government was being formed, he had been promised <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> recognition a few days later. If he should leave now, it would do <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> reputation in this country no good. Everyone would say <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had used him and then dumped him. This would not redound to credit of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Our approach was really making him the main problem in the current situation. We were saying he had to go in order to have a solution. This was not the way to treat a friend. All Dominicans had rejoiced when the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops came; the latter had saved the situation but then they had stopped short of finishing the job and the politics had begun.</p>
                        <p>7. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> resumed the effort. He stressed the deep cleavages in the country and the need for a political truce to allow time for wounds to heal. The committeeʼs talks with people from all sectors of population had convinced them the great majority who were not involved in the conflict above all wanted peace and a chance to work; but pacification was not peace. The need now was for an apolitical group to begin the work of restructuring the country and attacking the critical economic and military problems. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> had contributed greatly to saving the country; it was only natural that in taking vigorous <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0314"/>action one stirred animosities. A contribution in the greatest tradition of patriotism could be made by him.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> replied once again in the negative; his job was not yet finished. His time estimate was different from ours and he knew his people best. It was necessary that he continue and lead the country to honest elections.</p>
                        <p>9. The conversation ended on that note. It was friendly, intimate and in low key throughout. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> asked him to give further thought to our conversation and suggested that we meet again.</p>

                        <p>2628. From <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>. Committee has now completed its round of talks with civic and political leaders. Responses to our proposal from both sides are on record and we have had opportunity test reactions among wide range of other groups and individuals. Believe we can gauge current situation and future prospects in following terms.</p>

                            <item>Committeeʼs proposal in its essential elements still appears best available solution. Number of objections have been raised to single election and brief pre-electoral period but no consensus has emerged on alternatives. Furthermore, firm commitment to early elections is feature which obviously has greatest appeal to rebels, their supporters and, we believe, to country at large. Belief that elections will be held also promises be major factor in persuading at least a significant number of rebels to go along with peaceful solution. As result our talks I propose add following refinements: (a) election date will be set full nine months from date provisional government takes office; and (b) campaign period will be restricted to last three months, with six months of complete political truce preceding.</item>

                            <item>Major difficulty we face at moment is attitude of <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and his supporters in <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss>. He feels his pride is at stake and fears becoming object of ridicule if he were to step down now after, as everyone knows, we asked him to take the job in the first place. Appeals to reason and patriotism have so far failed and, while we should make preparations recommended <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 2617,<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">In telegram 2617 from Santo Domingo, June 26, <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> stated that he and <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> believed the United States should encourage <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> to “retire gracefully” in order to make way for a “moderate, middle-road provisional government.” If <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> stepped down, they recommended that the United States make several “gestures” that would boost <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs ego and demonstrate U.S. appreciation for his “service to non-Communist cause” during the past months of intense negotiations. Recommended were: a statement by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> calling attention to <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs patriotic role; award <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> the Legion of Merit or other decoration; and an invitation to visit with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> in Washington. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–9 DOM REP)</note> it seems likely considerable pressure will have to be used to get him out. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> is reinforced by hard-liners (including a few members of U.S. press corps) who insist that only “military solution” is adequate to meet Communist threat, and by various opportunists who see personal advantages in his remaining in office.</item>

                                <p>Attitude of military represents key factor in <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> problem. I am encouraged by Penna Marinhoʼs talk with De Los Santos and Wessin and by reports from Embassy Attachés that armed forcesʼ leaders may be prepared accept a new provisional government. I am hopeful that this will prove case and that, once presented with firm proposal for interim government including names, they will exert pressure on <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> to step down. I feel, however, that we have to be cautious in assessing this prospect. Military chiefs are as anxious as <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> for a solution by force. They may also fear that his removal could open way for their own. These factors, along with increasing sense of frustration engendered by developments such as yesterdayʼs incident in San Francisco,<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">According to telegrams 2613 and 2619 from Santo Domingo, both dated June 26, at approximately 4 a.m. an armed band of civilians with Communist involvement attacked the police headquarters, the army post, and a small police post in the city of San Francisco de Macoris. No clear reason for this uprising was cited other than it possibly being an effort to mount further violence in another part of island. The Constitutionalists suffered 8 dead and 30 wounded (1 <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> soldier wounded) before the Armed Forces brought the incident under control. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Dominican Republic, Vol. VIII)</note> might in end make them strongly resistant to any compromise solution.</p>
                                <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0316"/>
                                <p>In this regard, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> and I are aware of and fully share Dept.ʼs view that restructuring of military establishment here is absolutely essential. However, I do not see much hope for radical changes in armed forcesʼ leadership in near future if we are to have early solution. We need support of top military if solution is to be achieved and they, in turn, will require reassurances from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> and I do anticipate that Wessinʼs early removal will prove possible. Other changes will probably have to come more gradually. I am confident we will be able to use our influence and work closely with provisional government to accomplish this objective.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and company are not prepared step aside, I would propose inform him and military that no further aid for payment wages and salaries will be forthcoming. As I understand it, money for next round will not be available until Monday. We could easily hold off for two days, except perhaps for direct payments to municipalities which might be advantageous. I repeat hope use of this club will not be necessary. Explanation of facts of life to the military may be enough turn trick if <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> continues adamant.</item>

                            <item>On Constitutionalist side there are also number of problems. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and company still resisting on Communist issue, asking no-deportation guarantee, right of 14th of June to legal recognition and full range of public liberties without adequate provision to deal with subversion. Problem of constitutionalist military is also troublesome, as is proposal that Congress should pass on institutional act. However, I believe these can be effectively dealt with once satisfactory provisional government is at hand. We have impression large number in rebel camp are extremely anxious for solution and not prepared accompany Communists in self-immolation. Their major fear is that giving up fight would expose them to reprisals and repression. Provisional government headed by man in whom they have confidence plus firm assurance of elections should persuade these more moderate elements that time has come to end the struggle. Under these circumstances I would look forward to disintegration of movement at early date, even if rebel leaders for some reason should refuse to go along with our proposal at last minute.</item>

There is <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0317"/>surprisingly broad consensus here that new regime should be presidential, not collegiate in form. My colleagues and I agree. We have also about come to conclusion that <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Hector Garcia Godoy</persName> is best man available to head provisional government. He has broad support (Santiago group, Balagueristas and numerous independents); he is at least more acceptable than most to rebels; he is a good friend of ours; he is willing to serve and appears quite capable to us. As previously reported, we have asked Garcia to take appropriate soundings and come back Monday for specific discussions.</item>

                            <item>If Garcia returns with satisfactory answers I would propose push ahead in effort establish his provisional government during course of next week.

We are prepared to accept your judgment that most generally acceptable course would be six months moratorium on political activity to be followed by three months of campaigning and general elections nine months after Provisional Government inaugurated.

Restructuring of military establishment and changes in armed forces leadership desirable but agree that it is not practicable to achieve this now. We would hope provisional government could make a start but this is a problem for resolution later. Recent violence in the interior and <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> dependence on Dominican military for maintenance of order is additional reason for not introducing at this particular point in time conditions which would weaken and divide the military. We agree in this connection that reincorporation into armed forces of officers removed some time ago and some of those who went over recently to rebel side is impracticable.

                                <item>Rebels have apparently accepted <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_RBH1">Read</persName>UR letter (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 88),<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">Telegram 88 from Santo Domingo, July 9, transmitted the translated text of a July 8 letter from the Ad Hoc Committee to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName>ʼs. The principal point of the letter was that the Committee believed a provisional government must be set up as soon as possible in order for elections to be successful. The Committee considered the best candidates to lead the provisional government to be <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Hector Garcia Godoy</persName> as President and Eduardo <persName corresp="#p_RBH1">Read</persName> Barreras as Vice President. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Dominican Republic, Vol. IX)</note> which we understand they plan deliver at meeting later today. At moment we do not know how reply will be couched. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_SHW1">Shlaudeman</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cury</persName> has been pressing for inclusion impossible conditions as part of final effort block <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia-Godoy</persName> candidacy.

                                <item>If response is reasonably forthcoming we can move ahead, first requesting <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> group to avoid publicity until next steps can be worked out with <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> and <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss>–military side. We would first inform latter and ask their acceptance of provisional government to be headed by Garcia and <persName corresp="#p_RBH1">Read</persName>
                                    <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and friends. In meeting with committee this morning they indicated opposition to Garcia and gave us list of 21 other candidates for top spot in provisional government. However, if military backing for Garcia remains firm it should be possible overcome this obstacle in reasonably short order.</item>

                                <item>As Dept. is aware, <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and civilian members of <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> yesterday were threatening withdraw and turn govt. over to military. In todayʼs meeting they said this possibility still under consideration. It is our hope that <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and company will in fact resign before public announcement is made that provisional government under Garcia is to be formed. This would be face-saving gesture for <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and would facilitate negotiations by eliminating one side to this complicated situation. (However it is done, I am afraid we can expect some rather unpleasant publicity when <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> finally does step down.) Unfortunately, there can be no assurance that this script will be followed. Too many factors over which we have no control are involved.</item>

                                <item>Acceptance in principle by <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and military of Garcia-headed provisional government will still leave difficult problems to be resolved before new govt. can be installed. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and company are apparently going to insist on negotiating out problems of institutional act, armed forces leadership, future of constitutionalist military and general amnesty provisions before going through congressional process they regard as necessary to give new government “legality”. They want President-designate Garcia to participate in these negotiations as means of committing him to agreements reached. Number of difficult issues are involved here and we do not look forward to an easy time in thrashing them out.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>There are also problems on other side. Military are still opposed to naming a vice-president and continue favor electoral formula providing for prior Constituent Assembly elections. Rivera Caminero and his chiefs presently have no intention step aside as rebels insist they must. Re problem of constitutionalist military, we understand they now believe solution is to deport <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> officers, and keep them out of country for five years. Needless to say, rebels are scarcely thinking in these terms.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>As Dept. will appreciate from foregoing, I am not presently in position offer any realistic projection of time frame in which final solution might be reached. Committee hopes there will soon be agreement <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0321"/>on provisional govt. and that this will serve to move things ahead rapidly. However, range of problems still to be resolved suggests caution in that regard. I will continue keep Dept. informed of our progress and will endeavor provide as much advance warning as possible as to when key developments can be expected.</item>

Assuming provisional government is installed with agreement of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName>ʼs what is your estimate of action that would have to be taken, if any, to restore order in rebel zone? If action is required could this be done entirely by administrative measures of provisional government, that is stopping food deliveries, cutting off utilities, permitting egress but no ingress and waiting out those who resist? Or would there be only pockets of resistance which would rule out general measures such as cutting off utilities?</p>
                        <p>If some pacification is required should this be done by (1) <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>, (2) regular Dominican military or (3) a combined operation?</p>

In your estimate we desire particular attention be given to report received here in Washington that 14th of June and other extremist elements have had considerable success in penetrating enlisted and junior officer ranks in regular armed forces. Also desire your comments on what we understand to be Brazilian view that forces in <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName>ʼs area have shown greater strength and discipline over last few weeks and that their position continues to improve.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We fully share Departmentʼs impatience for definitive solution and concern over attitudes of government officials and public in <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, as well as over trend of public opinion in U.S. Unfortunately, it is difficult convey to those not intimately involved here just what a slippery and complex situation this is and what a cross-hatching and interrelation of competing pressures there are. As Department is aware from previous attempts settle the Dominican problem, there are key elements on both sides who do not want a solution. They are looking for victory and/or satisfaction of personal pride at any cost, up to and including complete ruin of the country. Bringing people like <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> to accept any compromise, let alone bargain in good faith, is no easy job.</p>
                        <p>Problem is particularly complicated by fact we are limited in means with which to achieve settlement. As we see it, our options are as follows: (1) We can use force or allow <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> to use force against <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and company. (2) We can bring about Constitutionalist collapse by making life unbearable in <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> zone—turning off water, closing checkpoints, etc. (3) We can cut <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> off from virtually all funds, using <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> to close Banco de Reservas and lock up Central Bank. (4) We can continue as we are doing, forcing pace of negotiations in order reduce issues to essentials and then come forward with proposed final solution. (Our strategy and timing are covered in ref <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>In our judgment use of first two alternatives would create worse problems than we now face. <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and world opinion in general would presumably react strongly against such measures. In addition, we <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0324"/>would be left with <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>. Neither <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> nor anyone else we have found acceptable to liberal opinion here or abroad would be likely to take job under circumstances, even if <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> could be forced out.</p>
                        <p>Suddenly cutting off all funds for government salaries (which we could have done early in game) might be just as bad from point of view our own vital interests. Unless <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> collapsed rapidly, allowing quick installation provisional government, we could have situation in which military would go without pay for some time. If this were to happen there is impression armed forces would not hold together for long. It is our understanding that maintenance of armed forces in being and continue integrity of officer corps are prime objectives, particularly in view arms distribution by rebels to all and sundry and extremist exploitation of that distribution. At least we clearly do now want to leave that field to <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and friends.</p>
                        <p>We realize that fourth alternative—one ad hoc committee is now pursuing—takes time and offers no hard guarantee of final success. Nevertheless, there seems no other feasible way to proceed. As explained in <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss>, negotiating process should be completed by end of this week. Committee will then come forward with final proposal, at same time exerting maximum pressure by all means available and with full support of Embassy. In order force acceptance it may finally be necessary to threaten or even use measures comprehended with our first three alternatives. Before doing so, however, it is important to be certain that our proposal is before Dominican and world opinion and that both sides have a chance to accept it.</p>
                        <p>During recent visit to Washington, <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> estimates solution could be reached in two to three weeks. Committee has been delayed by arrival of Latin American colleagues here a week late, by withdrawal of Read <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> and company. Despite these and other difficulties we are still hopeful we can finish up soon. As explained in ref <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss>, we hope see provisional government installed by middle of month at latest.</p>
                        <p>We would, of course, welcome any suggestions Department might have as to how we can move process along faster.</p>

                                            <item>This is of course assumption which <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> committee has been going on all along; it is extremely difficult to envisage how PG could be established, except by imposition, unless this assumption is fulfilled. Certainly it could not be under proposed leadership of <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> who has made his acceptance office contingent on Caamanoʼs agreement.</item>

Probably, however, there will remain some sporadic resistance by hard core extremists. It is doubtful that such resistance will be grouped in major geographical concentrations.</item>

                                            <item>We doubt that administrative measures, if unaccompanied by use of military force, would provide appropriate means for reducing any resistance remaining. Since such resistance is likely to be scattered rather than concentrated, administrative measures would be difficult to apply. Moreover, even if it proved possible to discriminate, such measures would be slow and insufficient, given considerable stocks of food and other supplies still available in rebel zone. If area or areas holding out contained important economic assets, such as commercial banks, delay would inhibit countryʼs return to normalcy.</item>

                                            <item>Military action would probably be required to overcome sporadic resistance of hard core of rebels who refuse to accept any agreement which fails to include their demands. In any event, these actions must be accomplished: positive turn-in of arms; positive check of critical facilities for mines, booby traps, etc. provision of normal police protection—traffic control; prevention of crime; protection of citizens and their property; security of public buildings and utilities. Restoration of utilities. Fire prevention and protection. Clean-up garbage and trash.</item>

But these efforts would be supplementary and designed not to substitute for military force but to minimize need for its use.</item>
                                            <label>6.</label>
                                            <item>It is possible that, if some rebels continued to resist after <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> had agreed to PG, <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> himself might take action against them. Indeed he himself has said as much. In such case, we believe it would be desirable for <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> to remain outside rebel zone for reasonable time to allow him to establish control over his forces. In event he unable to do so, or is held up for unreasonable time, then <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> should move in to ensure that job is done.</item>

                                            <item>Any pacification which may be required beyond what <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> himself undertakes should be done only by <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>. Use of regular DomRep forces and/or national police would only exacerbate hatreds and harden resistance. Combined operation would have same disadvantages.<gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> committee contemplates that upon installation of PG present <gloss target="#t_ISZ1">ISZ</gloss> would be extended to include rebel zone. Thus it appropriate that order should be established and initially maintained there by <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>. Later, after <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> forces had been in area for some time, joint <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>–national police patrols could be used, with eventually national police taking over entirely.</item>

In event it should become reality, force would have to be applied by <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> to degree necessary to restore order and unite capital under PG. Appropriate psyops, designed to weaken popular support of rebel forces, should be conducted in connection with denial measures which, under this hypothesis, would be feasible. Military operations should then be initiated, exact nature and scope depending in part on results of first psychological and denial phase. For example, if only light resistance were expected and encountered, operations should be conducted rapidly to clear rebel zone in its entirety. On other hand, if as events developed heavy resistance were expected and met, operations could be conducted by phases with appropriate psyops and denial measures conducted in between phases.</item>

                                <item>We believe that no communist should hold any position whatever in provisional government. (Communists defined as members of one or more of the three communist parties or those who are subject to control of one or more of these parties.) Furthermore, we doubt any positions in provisional government should be given communist “sympathizers”, however recognize this may not be feasible.</item>

                                <item>Agree that National Department of Investigations should be given responsibility for organizing and coordinating anti-subversive activities. How soon do you estimate recruiting could be accomplished and Department made a going, efficient operation once provisional government is established? We agree <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should provide assistance to this department but doubt this should be put in any written form until provisional government is set up.

                                <item>We agree that Dominican communists who entered country illegally after receiving training in communist countries should be arrested for violation of existing law prohibiting use of false identification documents. Is it clear that proposed amnesty to rebels will not be construed as preventing this? We also agree that Provisional President should promptly issue decree-law making it possible to arrest and convict for illegal possession of weapons. We also agree that Provisional President should issue decree-law prohibiting organization of political parties whose aims are incompatible with principles of representative democracy. Is this intended to supplement existing laws making the three existing communist parties illegal? Can we assume these existing laws will be in effect during provisional government period? We also agree that Provisional President should issue decree-law designed to prevent use of radio and press for slander and incitement to subversion. However we doubt wisdom of attempting to formulate code of conduct for press and radio or anything smacking of censorship. Would not strict enforcement of carefully drafted decree-law relating <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0334"/>to slander, incitement to subversion and promotion of unrest accomplish desired objective?</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>While we assume from <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss> those possessing false identification documents or unregistered weapons would be subject to arrest and conviction, it is not clear to us whether existing decrees and other laws which we assume would remain in force after provisional government established are adequate in sense of enabling authorities promptly and effectively to arrest and convict those who are engaged in various forms of subversion. We are reviewing information available to us here re existing laws on this subject and request report with detailed information re specific laws and comments re their adequacy. Dominican courts have a reputation for having been very ineffective in the past. Is there any reason to believe they will be more effective in the future even assuming the legal provisions are adequate for dealing with communist problem? Perhaps even more important is question of whether Institutional Act, particularly Article 2,<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">The final version of Article 2 reads: “The provisional president shall legislate on any matter not contrary to the provisions of this Institutional Act but approval by two thirds of the members of the cabinet shall be required when laws on the following questions are concerned: a. changes in the legal money and banking system; b. election of judges of the supreme court of justice; c. changes in the political boundaries of the national territory; d. approval or denunciation of international treaties; e. declaration of war against other states; f. sending Dominican troops abroad; g. establishment or abolition of courts of any nature; h. declaration of a state of siege in the event of disturbance of the public peace and, as a result thereof, suspension of the exercise of human rights set forth in Articles 16, 20–23, 30, 33 and 34 of this Institutional Act; and i. declaration of a state of national emergency, suspending the exercise of human rights with the exception of the inviolability of life.” (<hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Chronicle</hi>, October 1965, p. 25)</note> will vest in provisional government broad powers to issue such additional decrees as may be necessary to deal adequately and effectively with communist activities. We are reviewing draft of Institutional Act here with this question in mind and would also appreciate your views on this.</item>
                                <label>8.</label>
                                <item>We are backing away from suggestion that decree-laws should be approved by majority of Cabinet for fear that this may introduce same kind of indecision, lack of leadership and paralysis as exists in collegiate Uruguayan government today. We now believe <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> should have authority to issue decrees as President of provisional government. If safeguards are deemed desirable or would facilitate your negotiations suggest provision to effect President will “consult” with Cabinet before issuing decree but making it plain that majority support in Cabinet is not necessary. Additional possible safeguard could be that a two-thirds majority of Cabinet could veto any decree issued by Provisional President.</item>

                                <item>We continue to be concerned about Article 26<note n="4" xml:id="d121fn4">The final version of Article 26 reads: “No Dominican may be expelled from the country. The deportation or expulsion from Dominican territory of any alien shall take place only by virtue of a sentence rendered by a competent court, after compliance with due legal formalities and procedures.” (Ibid., p. 28)</note> of Institutional Act and <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs statements that no Dominican will be deported by Provisional Government. In addition to doing everything we can to make sure that laws are adequate and courts will enforce them, we think there should be understanding with <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> about internment of communists if this should prove to be necessary. Internment could be on some Dominican island as <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> suggested or at some place on Dominican mainland. This would be safeguard against possibility that communists will be clever enough to avoid possession of illegal weapons or false documentation and, since they will presumably have amnesty except for common crimes, it will be difficult to prove that they have violated some specific Dominican law.</item>
                                <label>10.</label>
                                <item>Obviously ability of Provisional Government to deal with communists will depend to large extent on will of <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>. Are we satisfied that he has made no commitments which would impede his ability effectively to deal with whatever communist problem arises and that he has the will to act?

                                <item>Question of command of armed forces is also intimately related to this problem. We should take every precaution to insure that not only Minister of Defense but Commanders of Army, Navy, Air Force and Training Center are anti-communist by conviction.</item>

                        <p>416. From <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>. Committeeʼs meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> group this afternoon brought negotiations down to what has always been gut issue here: makeup of armed forces high command. We came away with impression that other problems could be handled. Objections to Article 4<note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2">The final version of Article 4 reads: “The provisional vice president of the Republic, who shall have under his direction one of the ministries, shall take the place of the provisional president in case of his temporary or permanent absence. The vice president shall be chosen from among the members of the cabinet, upon nomination of the president, through the affirmative vote of the two thirds of the cabinet. In case of the permanent absence of the provisional president, and in case the provisional vice president is also temporarily or permanently absent, the duties of provisional president of the Republic shall be discharged by the following persons in this order: The presiding judge of the supreme court of justice; the deputy presiding judge of the supreme court of justice, and then the other judges of that court in descending order of age.” (<hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Chronicle</hi>, October, 1965, p. 26)</note> might well be worked out through memorandum of understanding or protocol re procedures for dismantling and disarming constitutionalist zone. Also, in our opinion, Article 8<note n="3" xml:id="d123fn3">The final version of Article 8 reads: “The national district and the municipalities of the Republic shall be governed by the provisions of Title X of the 1963 Constitution, which is based on the corresponding provisions of the 1962 Constitution, except that the council chairmen, mayors, and councillors of the municipal governments shall be appointed and may be removed from office by the provisional president of the Republic. Likewise, the provisional government shall be governed by the provisions of Title XI of the said Constitution.” (Ibid., p. 26)</note> difficulties (i.e. future of various types of constitutionalist military) are susceptible to treatment through some kind of compromise formula, perhaps involving a special board to review individual cases of officers involved. Article 10<note n="4" xml:id="d123fn4">The final version of Article 10 reads: “The provisional government shall in no way jeopardize the sovereignty of the Republic nor in any way alienate the property of the state.” (Ibid., p. 26)</note> was not even mentioned.</p>
                        <p>On other hand, it is difficult see where immediate solution to problem of armed forcesʼ leadership might lie. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>ʼs group made the point very clearly. (Up to now they have been avoiding issue but our proposal and public declaration has forced it into open.) <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> and Jorge Blanco insisted that Provisional Government could not be installed with Rivers, de los Santos, Martinez Arana and Wessin still at their posts. I pointed out that constitutionalists had previously agreed <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0338"/>leave all such matters to Provisional President and said that <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>, who is fully aware of problem, could be trusted to work out satisfactory solution. They, however, firmly maintained their position.</p>
                        <p>Tonight we again discussed situation with <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>. He is most reluctant go ahead without at least minimal agreement on part of rebels. Does not believe that provisional government could function (or even be formed, given timidity of his potential colleagues) without rebel acceptance. He also shares our impression that <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> is only prepared to sign “act of reconciliation” if other side also signs and if four points put forward by armed forces (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 405)<note n="5" xml:id="d123fn5">Telegram 405 from <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> in Santo Domingo, August 10, lists the Armed Forcesʼ four points: “1. All military who are abroad and who deserted shall remain outside of armed forces; 2. All officials who rebelled and who meet retirement age and conditions will be retired with pensions; 3. All rebel officers who in judgment chiefs of staff may constitute danger or may be in personal danger will be designated to post abroad; and, 4. Decisions of retirement board in accordance with organic law of Armed Forces, will be maintained as well as decisions of competent tribunals.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Dominican Republic, Vol. X, 8/65–9/65)</note> are explicitly understood to be binding. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> did say that he would be prepared go ahead and take office without final agreement if rebels (and presumably armed forces) would agree to installation under such condition. He urged, however, that we first make determined effort persuade <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and company accept our proposal as it stands.</p>
                        <p>We intend make this effort. First step will be private approach to <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> tomorrow morning in effort use him to enlist <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs aid. Emphasis will be on fact that this may well be last chance for solution favorable to <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> electoral ambitions and that party will ultimately lose if <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Aristy</persName> and extremists are allowed continue insist on impossible conditions. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> plans talk to Jorge Blanco in same vein. After these soundings have been made we will decide on strategy for next meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> group, probably to take place tomorrow afternoon. Will keep Department informed as we go along.</p>
                        <p>Re suggestions in <gloss target="#t_D1">Deptel</gloss> 216,<note n="6" xml:id="d123fn6">
                                <ref target="#d122">Document 122</ref>.</note> I agree that we must continue efforts persuade <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> take over without firm agreements on all outstanding issues. It is clear, however, that he will not assume office solely on basis <gloss target="#t_GNR1">GNR</gloss> acceptance of “act of reconciliation”. It also clear, in my opinion, that he would not be prepared—at least at outset—to acquiesce in use of coercive measures such as sealing off rebel zone. I think best we can hope for is that he would take over on basis simple agreement of both sides that he do so, with negotiations for final settlement to continue thereafter.</p>
                        <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0339"/>
                        <p>Time frame is still difficult predict but it seems likely at least a few more days will be necessary to complete our efforts. We are very conscious of risk that delay will give <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> an opportunity back away from his commitment. We are also aware that with self-serving politicians now rising to the attack, <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs candidacy is in jeopardy. Nevertheless, I believe we must continue along line we have set.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>The pro-Chinese Communist Dominican Popular Movement (<gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss>) will probably initiate a program of terrorist activity in the Santo Domingo area and an elementary form of guerrilla warfare at one or more points in the interior. The pro-<persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> 14th of June Political Group (<gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss>) is divided on whether or not to launch a major guerrilla effort in the interior, but it is better prepared and enjoys greater capabilities than the <gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss> for this type of insurgency. Because Communist-affiliated groups lack popular support in the Dominican Republic, the Dominican military and police could probably severely limit such insurgent activity to a degree where it would not pose a serious threat. If however, harsh repressive measures are carried out indiscriminately and the economic situation does not improve, the leftist extremists might then gain enough support from non-Communist groups to threaten the provisional government.</p>

Embassy had prepared rough draft of memorandum (<gloss target="#t_D1">Deptel</gloss> 181, para 1) and we discussed it point by point, agreeing that it should be put in final form for approval and verbal agreement. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> was in general agreement with our proposals, with one or two indefinite points as noted below.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> emphasized his determination that PG would be anti-Communist and aligned with United States in opposing communism in all facets. He indicated his intention take every opportunity to eradicate movementʼs growth and check its influence in DomRep and said he will issue instructions to this effect to his Minister of Interior and Security Chief. We will discuss those at subsequent meeting. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> reiterated intention to take police out of Armed Forces Ministry and put them back under Interior.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> was unequivocal in stating he would invoke emergency powers and, if necessary, order internment of dangerous Communists under authority of institutional act should his government, Dominican nation or friendly governments need such protection against Communist subversion.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> agreed that no Communists, Castroites or <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>/Communist sympathizers should hold critical positions in PG. He stressed his interest in receiving confidential information on candidates for position. He agreed that members of <gloss target="#t_PCD1">PCD</gloss> (recently the <gloss target="#t_PSPD1">PSPD</gloss>) and <gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss> should automatically be kept out of government. He was somewhat less firm on tricky question of <gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss>. He readily admitted that members of “hard line” of 14 of June Party should be unacceptable for any position in PG. He stated, however, he had contemplated using some “soft line”<gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss> members in PG—not in critical positions, but in non-critical areas, apparently referring to such activities as forestry and public health. His thinking here is to draw away non-Communist members <gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss> and cut its appeal by offering non-Communist elements opportunity to participate in legitimate activities. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> also raised question of possible <gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss> participation in elections, is stressed [sic] our view that, while there may still be some non-Communists in party membership, <gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss> now clearly controlled by <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>/Communist elements and should not be allowed to participate in elections or any other important phase of political life in DomRep. Our view continues to be that policy and thrust of <gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss> now so clearly apparent that no individual currently active in movement should be given government position. Former or recent membership need not necessarily be a bar, and there is some persuasiveness in <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> reasoning of providing alternatives to non-Communist but frustrated youth who have been attracted to <gloss target="#t_APCJ1">APCJ</gloss>. We plan continue discussion with <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> along above lines.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> said he proposed to use moderate number of <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> such as Guido dʼAllessandro in his government.

He seems desirous complete cooperation in this field and said he would not only wish consult with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on choice of top personnel, but would welcome suggestions in selection of personnel. We discussed present state of disintegration of DNI and ways to get it organized and operating. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> welcomed our assurance that appropriate assistance would be provided DNI and secret police in their operations against <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>/Communist subversion.

                            <item>We found ready agreement on his part that Marxist subversives and their sympathizers would be kept under close observation and that those breaking law should be apprehended and held for trial. He expressed full awareness of difficulties in nature of public disorder and <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0342"/>strikes that will be mounted against control efforts but said he was quite resigned to being called a dictator and other names.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> showed less enthusiasm over suggestion for arrest of Dominican Communists and Castroites who have entered country illegally. He emphasized again his objection to deportation as a control method and was not disposed consider those returning from deportation as illegal entrants. I made point that these individuals were subject to detention and trail on purely legalistic, non-political grounds, but he did not commit himself definitely on this point.</item>

He agreed that the arrest of Communists and other subversives would have first priority in this respect.</item>

                            <item>Third point on which <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> displayed some hesitancy was proposal for decree-law implementing Article 17 of Institutional Act for the purpose of regulating political parties incompatible with principle of representative democracy (<gloss target="#t_D1">Deptel</gloss> 209 para 1). <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Godoy</persName> appeared have some trouble grasping the intent or objective of this proposal, and it is admittedly rather sophisticated legislation for this primitive political Communist. He wishes to discuss this further and has asked for copies of pertinent U.S. laws in order to study them.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> spoke of interest to create “council of information” to deal with abuses of freedom of speech and press. He has already approached Herrera of Listin and Ornes of Caribe, with latter predictably turning him down. He remarked on this score that he was ready to be called a dictator if necessary. But reiterated desire to put main responsibility on media owners for self-regulation. His sincerity on this point is unquestioned; we all agreed it will be difficult.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>In closing it was apparent <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> shares our desire to cooperate closely on Communist question, and wants regular consultation in this field. He said he would welcome written memorandum specifically outlining our understanding and we have that under preparation.</item>

                            <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0346"/>for the “Government of National Reconstruction.” By signing this Act, the parties agreed to “accept the Constitutionalist Government led by <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Hector Garcia Godoy</persName> as the sole and sovereign government of the Dominican Republic.” The parties also agreed to accept: the Institutional Act resulting from this agreement as the constitutional instrument under which the Provisional Government would exercise its functions; a general amnesty provided for in Article 11 of the Institutional Act; an immediate withdrawal of contending forces from their zones of defense; the Provisional Governmentʼs responsibility for maintenance of public order; the establishment of special centers to collect arms held by civilians; the return of the Armed Forces under the Provisional Presidentʼs control without reprisal or discrimination for past actions in the Dominican conflict; and a negotiation with the Tenth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs to decide the withdrawal date and form of the Inter-American Peace Force.

He said that four or five emotional candidates running around the country stirring up the candidates will provide excellent fodder for the Communists. He added that, conservatively speaking, there are probably 200–300 hard-core, skilled, trained Communists in the Dominican Republic who will try to recruit malcontents. The Provisional Government must identify these Communists and take them out of circulation right away; they have no guts if you pick them up and lock them up.</item>

In this regard, Director <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">Hoover</persName> commented that, generally speaking, the military in Latin America are too heavy-handed and ill-trained for this type of work; a strong national police is the answer.</p>

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said that it is crucial that we treat our relations with the Provisional Government very carefully. The Provisional Government, by instinct, will not be brave on the Communist issue and we want to be in a position of doing more than simply telling them that they should be brave. We want to be able to show the Provisional Government specifically how they can do what needs to be done.</item>

In this regard, it was noted that there have been indications from certain members of the military already that they are not instinctively opposed to a vigorous police force in the area of handling Communists.</item>

He would like to assist such individuals to make the break and we believe this in both Dominican and our interest.</p>
                        <p>Re para 7: <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> continues have reservations about reaching back to arrest former deportees who returned to DomRep illegally. He argues number involved is small and he would be accused of political persecution, a charge which would affect unfavorably his broader effort against Communists. He agrees to necessity of keeping these and other Communists under close observation and to intern them in event of clear and present danger (para 2). We have recalled to him <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs consideration of Beata Island as secure internment site.

                        <p>Re para 10: <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> now believes Council of Information should be primarily keyed to radio industry. He said editors of three principal newspapers had agreed to self-regulation (he hopes they will honor promise), but are opposed to joint press radio council. He believes now it would be better to handle the two media separately.</p>
                        <p>Throughout these conversations and consideration of memorandum, <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> has shown sound, realistic attitude on control of communism.

                            <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> weathered a flurry of problems over the weekend and in general continued the painfully slow process of consolidating his position. Progress was more in evidence on the international front than at home. Fifteen countries have recognized the Provisional Government. This includes eleven <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> members including Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela (we have unconfirmed press reports that Chile has recognized) and four non–<gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> states, including France.</p>
                        <p>On the domestic front, implementation of the Act of Reconciliation is moving very slowly. The rebels have dismantled some of their defenses, but the collection of arms has not started in earnest. The regular military continue to regard <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> with doubt and uncertainty. Among the problems bothering the military are: (1) the premature issuance of a decree, without prior consultation, subordinating Wessinʼs force to the Army, (2) the failure to confirm the chiefs in their positions and to appoint a Minister of the Armed Forces, (3) the appointment of persons sympathetic to the rebel cause, particularly the manager of Radio Santo Domingo (RSD).</p>
                        <p>Over the weekend <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> moved to allay the fears of the military. He removed the RSD manager (although he transferred him to his own press office). He met with 100 top officers to explain his policies, including his anti-communist posture, and received the endorsement of the chiefs. He went to see Wessin with <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> to appeal to him on patriotic terms to leave the country, but not to threaten him. When the Dominican radio stations engaged in inflammatory broadcasts threatening to provoke public disorder, he ordered that they suspend operations and obtained prompt compliance.</p>
                        <p>The most immediate problem is how to get Wessin to leave the country. Wessin was not swayed by <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs appeal to his patriotism. <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>ʼs suggestions did not seem to move him. <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> has counselled <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> to wait a few days until he confirms the chiefs and Armed Forces Minister Rivera Caminero in their positions before taking up the issue again with Rivera Caminero.</p>
                        <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0353"/>
                        <p>I believe you are aware of the Jules Dubois story published yesterday that the Embassy tried to bribe Wessin to leave the country. Contacts made by Embassy personnel with Wessin during the past two weeks were of such a nature as to make it inadvisable to issue a flat denial of the story. The State–White House press line is one of <hi rend="italic">no comment</hi> if questions are asked.</p>

                        <p>The United States Government has undertaken responsibility for vetting personnel appointed by <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Hector Garcia Godoy</persName>, Provisional President of the Dominican Republic, in order to assist <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> in preventing the appointment of Communists and extreme leftists to responsible positions in the Provisional Government. This United States function is spelled out in a secret “Memorandum of Understanding of Handling the Communist Problem” which was agreed to by <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> during a meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> on 3 September 1965. Paragraph 3 of the Memorandum reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is paragraph 3 of <ref target="#d130">Document 130</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>On the instruction of Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] has been in contact with <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> for the past two months to make arrangements for this screening process. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> has made a total of 31 appointments to date; of these 18 were not submitted to us in advance. Of the 13 candidates whose names were submitted by <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> and screened [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], five had been appointed in spite of the fact that derogatory information on them had been given to <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. One case of particular importance is that of Manuel Ramona Morel Corda, who was appointed to the critical post of Attorney General. Basic biographic data on the five appointees on whom there is derogatory information are included in the attachment to this memorandum <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0354"/>together with the names of the other eight appointees who were vetted.<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2">Attached but not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It should be noted that <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> has had to act quickly in making these appointments. He has been under tremendous pressure to accommodate both sides, particularly the Rebels, and this is undoubtedly one of the reasons why he has appointed several undesirables from the Rebel side. In addition, there may be some genuine misunderstanding as to the definition of an “important post.” However, a continuation of this practice could bring into the upper and middle echelons of the Provisional Government a number of persons inimical to the best interests of the United States.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] will continue to screen <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs appointees and to make information and recommendations available to <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> and to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>. Should there be a difference of opinion between <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> and the U. S. Government regarding the acceptance of these recommendations, it is recommended that they be received and enforced by diplomatic representations in accordance with the criteria set forth in the secret Memorandum quoted in paragraph 1 above.</p>

The objection to the mobile group was twofold: (a) United States military were basically against placing a unit they firmly believed performed a military function in the police and (b) the general consensus was that due to the current sensitivity of the Dominican military aggravated by the Wessin y Wessin affair it would be impolitic to request <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> to place in the police a function that the Dominican military considered a military function. This would appear to them as additional denigration. <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0356"/>It was explained that a compromise plan had been proposed to use the personnel of a 300–man Air Force paratroop unit which had been trained by the United States Special Forces building into it a channel for [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] National Police intelligence input by the participation of some police with the unit.

One giving final approval to the whole program except the mobile force and the second discussing the Country Teamʼs approach to counterinsurgency, i.e., the first line of defense lies with the police and military garrisons and when they cannot cope and a military situation arises the “Mella” Battalion would be used. The second message was discussed and not found satisfactory. It was decided efforts should go forward to insure a fast reacting force in the pre-military phase of the counterinsurgency situation in the Dominican Republic.<note n="4" xml:id="d133fn4">Neither one of these reports was attached; however, a “Summary Report of the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] Study Team,” September 15, 1965, lists the teamʼs recommendations including an overall expansion of the public safety program, improved police service prior to the Presidential elections, and the establishment of a quick reacting counterinsurgency group within the police force.

                        <p>826. Joint State–Defense message. We have had several conversations with <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> today on military problem. He invited Allen<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">
                                <persName>C. Allen Stewart</persName>, Director, Office of Caribbean Affairs.</note> and me separately this morning and we went together to his house this afternoon accompanied by <persName corresp="#p_CWB2">Connett</persName>. There have been other exchanges by telephone.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> told us again this morning he considered resolution of arms collection and reintegration downtown area as his fundamental problem—until that resolved nothing else can go forward. Arrival of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has given matter even more urgency than before,<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>, in exile in Puerto Rico, arrived in Santo Domingo on September 25. The Embassyʼs account of his arrival is in telegram 820 from Santo Domingo, September 26. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–8 DOM REP)</note> since he wants to stay ahead of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs maneuvering which he is convinced will go on unceasingly and to deny <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> “refuge” of downtown section from which to operate. He considers <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs presence can easily contribute to the perpetuation of separate zone downtown. When I pointed out that we had feeling not much had been done to prevent <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0359"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs return at this time despite <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>ʼs and my urgings, he admitted <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs return inopportune but said he had no real way of stopping him, particularly in view provisions institutional act and his public position which is very much his personal philosophy that no Dominican should be barred from return to his country except in few extreme cases.</p>
                        <p>He expressed conviction that there will shortly be set in motion nationwide demand for action to be taken re military. He said he would prefer to stay ahead of this anticipated wave of public feeling rather than be forced by it. From practical point of view he made it clear he is convinced that arms collection and reintegration of rebel military will not be achieved as long as Rivera Caminero is Armed Forces Minister due unacceptability of latter to rebel leadership.</p>
                        <p>He therefore had in mind “package deal” to be announced in TV address this evening which would involve announcement of replacement of Rivera Caminero by Colonel Juan Esteban Perez Guillen, orders to <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> to reintegrate rebel military officers tomorrow in accordance with formula to cover several categories involved; arms would also be turned in immediately and way would thus be opened for reestablishment normal police authority over downtown area.</p>
                        <p>I told him we all shared his view that reestablishment of control over downtown was essential. We also agreed on desirability of military changes. However I told him emphatically that timing gave us great concern. We had backed him and assisted in removal of Wessin, not without some embarrassment to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. Wessinʼs removal while agreed on as a necessary step, had further unsettled military whose morale already low. Following conversation with him, word had been passed to military by <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> of his understanding that President planned no further changes in leadership just now. Only this morning Rivera Caminero had met with other chiefs and large group of officers at San Isidro to quiet military concern by stressing leadersʼ full support for PG and intention to make every effort to see it through to elections. On both above accounts, abrupt change of Rivera now would be regarded throughout military as sell-out.</p>
                        <p>I question timing on additional ground involving <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>ʼs return yesterday. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> had made a violent speech demanding removal of 8 to 10 top officers of armed forces. If <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs demagogic demand were followed on very next day by removal of Minister of Armed Forces, this would be regarded in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as simple cave-in to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs demand and would in my opinion merely stimulate further demands from <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> side.</p>
                        <p>Further, and perhaps most important as regards effective settlement, this seemed to us an arrangement without any enforcement provisions as regards <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>ʼs side of bargain. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> had made <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0360"/>many promises and was already in substantial default on carrying out provisions of Act of Reconciliation. To make public sacrifice Minister Armed Forces in loose agreement which could not be enforced seemed to me to be a step which had considerable danger (in terms of effect on local and international opinion and on possible reaction armed forces) without any real assurance of obtaining objectives sought.</p>
                        <p>I went on to stress that my government, while sympathetic to his very difficult problems, was nonetheless concerned over some of trends developing. I mentioned again Washington concern over changes in the sugar industry for example. There had been little balancing action to numerous appointments made as result of pressures from constitutionalist side in both military and civilian posts. He acknowledged that he was unhappy about number of appointments but insisted the situation could be rectified once he had turned corner by dismantling rebel zone and establishing his authority therein. He continued express view that removal of Rivera Caminero was necessary to this end.</p>
                        <p>In afternoon meeting we argued that if he were determined to remove Rivera Caminero we must urge strongly that it be preceded by some fulfillment of obligations on constitutionalist side. We recommended specifically that Rivera Camineroʼs removal be made contingent upon completion of arms collection process, reintegration of constitutionalist military into armed forces, and establishment of provisional governmentʼs authority over rebel zone. A phased operation was discussed, with idea of achieving it in two or three days time. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> could be given assurance in advance that change would be made when operation completed and Rivera Camineroʼs cooperation to program might even be obtained. President prepared to assign Rivera to post in Washington in line latterʼs desire.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> seemed to give considerable weight to our argument although still obsessed with his downtown problem.</p>
                        <p>On learning later in afternoon of <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>ʼs planned return, Allen and I telephoned him separately to urge that no action be taken to put plan in action until there were chance for discussion with <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>. He said he had already talked with Perez Guillen and <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> but had made no definitive agreements. We have learned later [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] that Perez Guillen told Army Chief of Staff that he had been called to President who had discussed with him ways to dispose of rebel military problem. Perez told Martinez Arana he had not been offered any post. Rumors have circulated downtown this afternoon, presumably through <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>, of Rivera Camineroʼs ouster. However, we believe we have pulled <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> back for moment and there will be opportunity for further discussion.</p>

                        <p>431. For <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>. We share your view<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">See <ref target="#d134">Document 134</ref>.</note>—also repeatedly expressed by <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>—that most pressing problem confronting PG is reopening of downtown and that the longer this is delayed, the greater the erosion in public support for and authority of PG.</p>
                        <p>What we do not see clearly is how he plans to achieve this objective. He moved resolutely against Wessin but he has not acted with same determination in arms collection and reintegration of rebel zone. In our judgment further concessions to the rebels at expense of military will not do the trick without upsetting delicate balance of forces essential to his maintaining moderate, middle-of-the-road position. If he looks upon prior reintegration of rebel military into regular units as key to dismantling of downtown area, we think he is following mistaken course. Probably most of rebel enlisted men, non-coms and junior officers could be put back into their units without major difficulties. But trying to reintegrate 20–25 key officers into their regular units is a most difficult, if not impossible, enterprise given deep-seated animosity which exists between two camps at this level. We wonder whether with respect to key officer groups some quick solution might not be found which will permit prompt reopening of downtown area. It would be preferable, of course, to give these officers foreign duty or training assignments, both for their own security and to get them out of country until passions cool. If they want training maybe we could help. If they are unwilling to accept such assignments, would it be possible to place them in some appropriate installation outside rebel zone or disperse them individually in garrisons around country, with personal security guaranteed, until <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> can work out with each officer and military services appropriate assignment? Request that you explore this matter thoroughly with <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> in effort break impasse on dismantling rebel zone.</p>
                        <p>Another matter which is of deep concern to us is failure of <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> to strike more of balance between right and left. Image which he is projecting is one of greater and greater concessions to rebels at expense of moderate and conservative elements. If he is to maintain his authority throughout country, it seems to us that he must move <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0362"/>with equal energy against both extremes when they get out of line. In failing to act decisively (as he did in Wessin case) against strong-arm methods of extremists at government offices, business enterprises and university, he is running serious risk of undermining public confidence in his impartiality and ability to steer middle course against pressures from both extremes. Request that you discuss this matter again with <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> and stress importance of his redressing balance both from domestic and international standpoint.</p>
                        <p>We understand his desire to bring about basic changes in military establishment as rapidly as possible. We think it would be serious mistake, however, to take any further action along this line until situation downtown resolved. Once this is accomplished, we believe political and economic picture will be substantially improved and his hand strengthened to take further steps in dealing with military problem. Request you also convey foregoing to him, pointing out that he can count on our support in his subsequent efforts to reorganize military establishment.</p>

I have his assurance that he will make a special effort himself to insure that volunteers understand the sensitive nature of their work. After all, it is quite simple: if they start criticizing U.S. policy down there, they will simply shut down the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic and give the whole operation a bad black eye.</p>

                                <item>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> suggested that the time has now come for the Provisional Government “to redress the balance.” The impression is widespread both in the Dominican Republic and abroad that the Constitutionalists and their extremist allies have had all the best of it since the installation of the new government. Concessions to the rebels were obviously necessary as long as their zone remained intact but, with that problem now resolved, it should be possible for <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> to make it clear that his administration will be impartial and free of extremist influence. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> pointed out that the Provisional Governmentʼs unfavorable image resulted in large part from a few specific situations: i.e., the appointment of Morel Cerda as Attorney General, the presence of Franklyn Dominguez in a key position in the National Palace, the strong <gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss> influence in the immigration service at the airport, and the extremist, pro-rebel line being followed by the government-owned <hi rend="italic">Radio Santo Domingo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La Nacion</hi>.</item>

                                <item>President <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> said he was fully aware of the doubts raised by certain of his appointments and by other concessions he had made to the Constitutionalists. However, he strongly believed that his conciliatory strategy and the moves resulting from it had been absolutely correct. For example, the appointment of Domingo de la Mota as Director of Sports was open to justifiable criticism on political grounds but de la Mota took 300 men with him out of the rebel zone and kept them out. Similarly, the new governor of Puerto Plata—a Constitutionalist—persuaded two commandos of men from his region to leave and return home. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> said he gave people in this category jobs only to help restore peace and that some of those involved were aware of his purpose and expected to be replaced in time.</item>

Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> also suggested that it would be desirable for the government to reassure the country regarding its intention to hold elections on schedule. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> agreed and said he intended in the near future to call in all the political leaders for consultations on the composition of the Central Electoral Board and other questions relating to the elections.</item>

                                <item>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> expressed the opinion that <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> should pay careful attention to the problem of his relations with the military high command. Maintaining good communications with Rivera Caminero and the chiefs should be a matter of principal concern to the President. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> thought relations had improved in that quarter recently and urged <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> to make every effort to keep them good.</item>

It was his impression that the amount of aid required had been seriously underestimated. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs regime issues $19–20 million of checks covering payroll and other expenses in July and August for which funds were not available. The Provisional Government was forced to come up with this money. Now, additional assistance over and above the $20 million grant would be needed.</item>

                        <p rend="center">SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>The Dominican Republic is in a state of suspended revolution, and the provisional government headed by <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> has the task, in effect, of reconciling irreconcilables. If he seems to be favoring the rebel cause, he risks intervention by the armed forces; if he leans to the other side, he risks new outbursts of rebel violence. The underlying political trend in the D.R. is to the left, which enhances the prospects of a left-of-center candidate, if elections are held as planned. If such a candidate won, his government would probably be anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Communist-influenced. The military would likely seize power to keep out this kind of regime, but a military take-over would cause sizeable elements of the left to turn to systematic terrorism and guerrilla activity.</p>

                            <item>It is, of course, too early to make any very specific election predictions. Indeed, the elections may not be held on schedule at all. If they are held, it is not yet clear who the candidates would be or what party combinations may be worked out. Although there may be a candidate or two of the extreme right (for instance, the exiled General Wessin y Wessin has been talking about throwing his hat in the ring), most rightist backing will probably be for <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, running on the ticket of his Reformist Party as a center-conservative candidate. Similarly, although one of the Communist parties may produce a nominee of its own, most leftist backing will probably go to the candidate of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> party. It might be <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> himself, <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName>, leader of the revolution, or perhaps a party figure not so well known.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>Some observers believe that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would win such a contest over any man the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> could put up. They argue that much of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs old magic is gone—particularly because of his failure to return to the D.R. while the fighting was going on. They dismiss <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> as not politically shrewd enough. They note that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> still has <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0369"/>much prestige and is widely respected, and predict that many Dominicans will vote for him as the man who might bring back order and tranquillity.</item>
                            <label>14.</label>
                            <item>These are all points of some merit. But there are some broader considerations certain to have impact. We think, for example, that the expansion in size of the electorate—those who have politically awakened during the past few years and the large additional number of young people now qualified to vote—will strongly favor the left. We believe that many will vote for the “candidate of the revolution” because they see this movement as their only hope for rapid improvement in their depressed living conditions. The insistence by the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> party and the leaders of the revolution of their determination to reinstate the <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> constitution of 1963, with its provisions for agricultural reform and various other measures to improve the lot of the masses, provides a powerful initial issue for the campaign. Nationalistic resentment against the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intervention is also likely to favor the parties of the left. On balance, we think the candidate of the left will be in the stronger vote-getting position.</item>
                            <label>15.</label>
                            <item>If such a candidate won the election, his government would probably be anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Communist-influenced. The Dominican military leaders would be likely to seize power to prevent the installation of such a government. Indeed, if the election of a leftist candidate seemed likely, the military would probably intervene before voting took place.</item>
                            <label>16.</label>
                            <item>In the event of a military takeover, or even if <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> or someone like him won the presidency, sizeable elements of the left (and not only the Communists) would probably turn to systematic terrorism and guerrilla activity. Although the military might be able to cope with this development initially, their repressive actions would tend to antagonize the people and to lead eventually to another round of revolution.</item>

It cannot be done by November 3rd, the date planned, but he expects it will be done in “about a week to ten days.” According to the Ambassador, he further expects that <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia-Godoy</persName> will agree to the use of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> in conjunction with the National Police to attempt to pick up the arms, as it is obvious that current arms sweeps are in no way successful. The thorniest problem is still the reintegration of the rebel military into the Armed Forces. No accepted solution has been reached as yet. The Ambassador stated it was most important that the camp housing the rebel military be closed out as it is a source of potential trouble.</item>

He advised it was his opinion that, if there was a strong possibility the known Leftists could come into the government through an election, we should take steps to postpone the election especially as we are behind schedule anyway. He asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> for his opinion. The Ambassador agreed that we are behind schedule. He stated <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia-Godoy</persName> is “too good” to be President, really has no supporting cabinet as all the worthwhile people refuse to take jobs and <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia-Godoy</persName> is “killing himself.” The Ambassador stated that he is of the opinion we should make no decision now in regard to postponing the election. We should wait until the “package deal” is completed, at <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0372"/>which time he expects things will approach normalcy and then we can make up our minds regarding the election.</item>

Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> stated, in his opinion, it was not a definite plan.

                        <p>I submit herewith a memorandum which I believe will be of positive interest to you. It concerns twenty-six appointments to important government positions made by <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia-Godoy</persName> since the formation of the Provisional Government.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] While these appointments represent a relatively small percentage of President <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia-Godoy</persName>ʼs total appointments to date they are highly significant because of the power to influence and shape policy accorded these positions. Also, these positions are important because those occupying these high offices control to a large degree the employment of others within their respective organizations.

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Tom:</p>
                        <p>While I would not want to go too far out on a limb, I do feel a certain qualified optimism at the end of this week.</p>
                        <p>The move of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> into the city has without question provided the personal security for the population at large which has made other <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0374"/>forward steps possible. The opening of the banks and the two regular newspapers this week are the longest strides towards normality yet taken.</p>
                        <p>The failure of the general strike which the communists were trying to organize was a heartening thing. It lends credence to my own conviction that the rank and file of Dominicans want nothing more desperately than peace and a chance to work, notwithstanding the noise made by the extreme left which is all too often pumped up out of proportion by some of our enterprising and not very judicious press reporters. It was also helpful that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> spoke out against the strike, and the Secretary General of his party, who lunched with me today, told me that instructions have been sent out to all the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> branches to fight the communists on the labor front. This is a new and welcome sense of reality on <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs part. I think <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> made a mistake in leaving the play, and thus the credit, on dampening down the strike to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. He could have gained some kudos by going on the radio himself, but he chose not to do so. At any rate, any time something bad does not happen means one step forward. Further in the labor field, our own labor movement and the international units to which it is affiliated now have a whole raft of people here. They are moving about actively and have shown some of their muscle both in meetings with the President and in the Labor Ministry. This should be all to the good, although the labor picture here is involved and the fight will not be an easy one.</p>
                        <p>As for <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>, he really seems at last about to move on some of the bad appointments. He has asked agreement of the Uruguayans to receive Attorney General Morel Cerda as Ambassador in Montevideo. We hope to press on to get that accomplished in short order. He seems on the point of moving also on the radio and information sector. There have been other deplorable appointments, but these are the two fields in which the most danger has been done.</p>
                        <p>Reintegration of the military still remains a major problem and Ellsworth will be pressing on that, with our help there useful. At least <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> now accepts the need for people like <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> to leave the country, (he had already agreed on Montes Arache) and he has talked with them. That will make possible some balancing off with the pressure on the other side in the regular military leadership. My own view is that <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> should leave first, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> any more of the regular military. This will be a delicate operation but it ought to be possible to bring it off. At least the fever is out of the situation for the moment.</p>
                        <p>On the economic side the Dominicans, despite general disorganization, are pulling together better and we are getting a few things going.</p>
                        <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0375"/>
                        <p>The far right is plotting, as is the extreme left. There could of course be further killings at any time. There was one today, this time perpetrated by the rebel Chief of Intelligence, in a restaurant patronized by our own people. Taking out people like Morel Cerda will go a long way to disarming rightist excitement and we can move forward from there. For the first time I believe we may have turned the corner.</p>
                        <p>There is hard work ahead, and no solution in this country is likely to be wholly satisfactory, but at least we are perhaps on the way.</p>
                        <p>With warm regards as always,</p>
                        <p>Yours very sincerely,</p>

                        <p>I request your authorization to begin negotiations immediately with the Provisional Government of the Dominican Republic for the provision of $30 million of assistance to reduce political and economic pressures so that we can move toward the installation of an elected government and our withdrawal. We presently estimate that $50 million is the minimum needed for the balance of FY 1966. An additional amount of $25 million ought to be set aside now in case our estimates of financial and political needs and Dominican capabilities are proven wrong.</p>
                        <p>To meet these financial requirements $25 million can be made available from previously appropriated funds. This will exhaust the Contingency Fund. The balance would be dependent upon obtaining a supplementary appropriation. The $25 million currently available will meet our needs through December 31.</p>
                        <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0376"/>
                        <p>Since it will take until December 1 to establish procedures tying dollar disbursements to U.S. exports, assistance provided for November will have adverse effects on our balance of payments. Not more than $12.5 million will be disbursed in November. All assistance over this amount will be tied to procurement of goods and services in the U.S. The Treasury Department has stated that it will not object to this arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Since the overthrow of the Dominican government in April the U.S. has made large amounts of supporting assistance available to reduce potential economic complications and elements of political instability by helping meet government payrolls and provide for employment. The Provisional Government has proven to be weaker than feared. President <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia-Godoy</persName>ʼs financial advisers, who appear to be intelligent and conservative men, have reported serious budgetary problems now and into next year.</p>
                        <p>In an effort to ascertain the full extent of the Dominican financial problem, Assistant Secretary Anthony N. Solomon recently visited Santo Domingo to discuss the financial situation with U.S. and Dominican officials.<note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2">Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SAM1">Solomon</persName> visited the Dominican Republic October 29–November 2 to examine food distribution problems and assess economic assistance needs for FY 1966.</note> The estimates of external assistance needed are the result of his findings which are concurred in by the Country Team. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM1">Solomon</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>, and the Country Team further believe that the weakness of the Provisional Government prevents our insisting on a commitment to devaluation of the exchange rate when shown necessary as we have when we negotiated program loans with Colombia, Chile, and Brazil. Therefore, the negotiating strategy will be to tell the Dominicans that our maximum assistance through FY 1966 will be $50 million and that requirements beyond that will have to be met by their own resources. This is intended to limit our financial help and force the Dominicans to reduce their expenditures, increase their revenues, or utilize domestic means of covering deficits.</p>
                        <p>Our assistance will continue to be focused on playing down possible political problems by helping the government pay government employees their salaries and providing emergency employment on important public works projects. The government needs at least an estimated $20 million for wages and salaries before the end of 1965 and cannot be expected to obtain this amount from other sources. Although we estimate that it can eliminate the deficit in ordinary budget operations in 1966, it will need an estimated $15 million for wages and salaries in 1966 before this occurs.</p>
                        <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0377"/>
                        <p>The additional $15 million in this $50 million package includes $5 million for the balance of 1965 and $10 million for early 1966 to finance port reconstruction, irrigation, road maintenance and other high priority employment giving activities. These serve more importantly to siphon off potential dissidents from political activity.</p>
                        <p>Our best judgment is that $50 million will be required for the achievement of a political climate within which to pursue our aims but that an additional $25 million should be available since accurate projections of the Dominican situation are not possible to make. We will attempt to negotiate for the maximum self-help possible, subject to existing political circumstances. The negotiation of this package is a desirable alternative to the present situation where we receive piecemeal requests from time to time. Furthermore, we believe the Dominicans are prepared in connection with the U.S. assistance to impose increased taxes on imports and restrict internal credit.</p>

As of the same date, the countryʼs major newspapers, <hi rend="italic">El Caribe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Listin Diario</hi>, resumed publication. Shops and stores in the former Zone are now conducting business in a normal manner. The port of Santo Domingo is <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0378"/>open and servicing ships—seven were discharging cargo on November 12—and preparation for the rehabilitation of the portʼs facilities, extensively damaged during the revolt, will begin this week under the supervision of a representative of the Bureau of Yards and Docks.</p>
                        <p>Since the securing of the former Constitutionalist Zone by the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> on October 25, the situation of public order in Santo Domingo has improved markedly. The National Police has gradually increased its strength and effectiveness in the former Constitutionalist Zone and now maintains 24–hour foot and motor patrols in the area. The Inter-American Peace Force has been able to reduce its presence in the former Zone to one U.S. Battalion and three Latin American companies.</p>
                        <p>Despite the generally quieter atmosphere, isolated incidents of shooting and other forms of violence continue to occur frequently in Santo Domingo. Significant improvement in police morale and effectiveness is needed, as are more vigorous measures to disarm the civilian population. The house-to-house search for arms conducted by civilian-military-police teams has produced very little. As a further effort toward disarmament, President <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> on November 14 issued a decree offering monetary rewards for arms turned in voluntarily during the last half of this month. A graduated schedule of payments according to type and condition of weapons was established.</p>
                        <p>An improvement in the political climate was reflected by the last-minute decision of Communist elements—particularly the Dominican Popular Movement (<gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss>)—to cancel their call for a general strike scheduled to take place November 4. Ex-Presidents <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> had come out against the strike, both issuing constructive statements urging support for the Provisional Government. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> followed up this small success by initiating a series of conferences with leaders of the non-Communist political parties in order to lay the groundwork for next yearʼs elections and as a means of reaching agreement on the pre-campaign political truce stipulated in the Institutional Act. During the consultations, and in recent statements to the press, <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> reiterated his firm intention to hold elections within the nine-month period set by the Institutional Act. A further helpful political development occurred on November 13 when a group of prominent leaders, including <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, publicly subscribed to the terms of a “moral commitment” repudiating all acts of violence and calling for the suspension of demonstrations that might affect public tranquillity during the period of the political truce.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, several of the more important rightist political leaders refused to join in this commitment. Rightist plotting against the Provisional Government continues and we have reports of various schemes promoted by this sector to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>. However, success would depend on the cooperation of the Armed Forces <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0379"/>and there are presently no indications that such cooperation would be forthcoming. Relations between the President and the military chiefs have improved substantially of late. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> has assured the chiefs that he will make no changes in the high command without consulting them, while they, for their part, have pledged support for the Provisional Government and respect for civilian authority. A further strengthening of these relations may be expected when <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> makes the changes he has planned in his administration. He intends shortly to replace his Attorney General and Chief Information Officer, both of whom are rebel sympathizers of pronounced leftist tendencies. He has promised additional moves, including reorganization of the government-owned radio and television station, designed to bring the Provisional Government back toward the center of the political road.</p>
                        <p>The most critical problem at the moment results from the failure so far to make significant progress toward the reintegration of the Constitutionalist military into the regular Armed Forces. The concentration of rebel officers and men at the 27th of February Camp is a factor of continuing uncertainty and a threat to the process of stabilization. Reintegration has been stalled by the question of what to do with those ex-military men in <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName>ʼs forces who were not on active service as of April 24. We are pressing <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> to make the necessary decisions and get on with reintegration.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Tom,</p>
                        <p>I had planned to write you a proper letter this morning, but word came at dawn of my motherʼs death last night, and I am accordingly en route to Georgia—hence this paper will have to do.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that we have been in the midst of taking another poll as to local reactions and opinions, similar to the one done last winter. The interviewing was to be finished today, with tabulations, collations, etc. to take about six weeks—final results scheduled for early January, a little earlier if possible. The director of the field work came in to see me late yesterday, stressing that his impressions and conclusions were <hi rend="italic">preliminary</hi>, but based on experience elsewhere which, as you know, has been amazingly accurate in measurements of public opinion in several Latin American countries.</p>
                        <p>First of all, the poll-takers find that Dominicans favor U.S. intervention at a rate of 6 to 1. This, by coincidence, is extremely close to the Harris poll finding American opinion 84% in favor. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> put it the other way ‘round two days ago when he remarked to Congressmen Roybal and Fraser<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">Edward R. Roybal (Democrat–California) and Donald M. Fraser (Democrat–Minnesota).</note> that 85% of the Dominican people do not want the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> to leave—notwithstanding the noise made by the agitators and so played up by the press. The poll director found that the <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0382"/>overwhelming majority want the force here through elections, and he anticipates that when that time comes, they will not want them to leave then either. Most expect the “big fight” to come later, to put this yearʼs events in the shade.</p>
                        <p>If I remember correctly, last winterʼs poll<note n="3" xml:id="d146fn3">Not further identified.</note> showed <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> 46%, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> 28%. The Director said it is his opinion on the basis of the unprocessed data that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will be shown now to be somewhat, perhaps considerably, stronger than he was before. People in general think of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> as one of them, honest, stable and steady, and the man who put price controls on basic commodities. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is regarded as erratic and unstable, a man who says one thing one day and something quite different the next day, a leader who “let the people down.” The director commented wryly that Trujillo would run a good race if he were back.</p>
                        <p>The polling was done first in the rest of the country, Santo Domingo city the last and just now being finished up. There was the warning that the city polling might cause some change in the above, but not to any great extent. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> himself is hopeful of carrying as much as 50% of the city.</p>
                        <p>Although youth finds stimulation in the idea of revolution—not surprisingly—the revolution itself seems hardly to have penetrated beyond the city, except for some evidence of support in San Pedro de Macoris (depressed sugar town in the east). The American image as the source of all that is good, true and wise (as well as responsible for everything that happens—good or bad) seems not to have been dented at all. We are still regarded as honest, generous and well-intentioned—a generally beneficent image—but at the same time as bumbling and not very careful of the money we offer too open handedly—not sharp enough, or not caring enough in view of our “unlimited” resources, to keep the rascally Dominican politicians from making off with the money we so generously make available and preventing it from reaching the people. We are still thought of everywhere as those people who can make all things possible and who can cause the milk and honey to flow.</p>
                        <p>Food—and presumably work—is the principal concern and problem around the country. The food program is much criticized, but not the United States. Here again, the U.S. is thought of as the generous provider (although we often send food to which they are unaccustomed, donʼt want and donʼt know how to prepare), with the local officials and priests considered the villains who play favorites or steal the food and sell it. I suspect that just enough of this does go on to <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0383"/>provide the basis for the widespread and exaggerated charges. Poor quality foodstuffs are not blamed on the United States, which is considered to have such high standards of quality that it would not stoop to send inferior materials—obviously it is the local handlers who have kept the best for themselves and pawned off shoddy seconds on the people.</p>
                        <p>The above tends to show the great dependence—the overdependence—which characterizes Dominican attitudes towards the United States. The trust in us is what I have seen everywhere—including this weekʼs trip with the Congressmen—and it is heartwarming and at the same time rather pathetic. The obverse of this coin is that when anything goes wrong, it is our fault because we are so all-powerful that we could have kept it from going wrong had we only wanted to. A front-page article last week in one of the newspapers sustained that “the Dominican Republic could have peace and stability if only the United States wanted it that way”! Even the far left expects us to pay for their programs, once they achieve power.</p>
                        <p>Both the political findings and the psychological attitudes largely confirm my own views. At several points in the conversation I remarked to the poll director that he was taking the briefing right out of my mouth. After all, I am now in my fifth year in this country, which means, I believe, that I have spent more of my adult life in this Republic than has <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>! I await the confirmed results of the poll with great interest.</p>

                        <p>Phillips said there now were solid grounds for confidence that the Provisional Government would last and that there would be elections as scheduled. The broad underlying question now is: will both parties, i.e., <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, run—or will the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> boycott the elections? <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has already hinted that he will not stand for election if the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> is still present, and that there is no use in his running anyway because the Pentagon would never let him take office. If <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> did refuse to run it would make things very bad for us.</p>
                        <p>In reply to <persName corresp="#p_SRM1">Sayre</persName>ʼs question, Phillips said that he did not believe that the Dominican military would let <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> hold office for more than a week. In response to Gardnerʼs question, <persName corresp="#p_SRM1">Sayre</persName> said that it would be bad if <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> refused to run, but it would be worse if he did, won, and then got tossed out.</p>

                        <p>Later in the meeting there were murmurings about the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] poll in the Dominican Republic. I gathered the results thus far indicate that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> stands no chance at all. According to these same murmurings, 64% of the Dominican Republic thinks it a good idea that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops came in. This percentage seems unreal; it is possible that it refers only to rural vote. Gardner did not press for clarification [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the quality of the Dominican security forces. Phillips said that police morale had not been good but that Cerdaʼs removal had brought on almost immediate transformation. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] interest in the police lay in having them a) become an effective intelligence-gathering outfit and b) evolve an effective rural program with good and rapid lateral and vertical communications. The officers of the new rural police force have all been chosen and are undergoing training, as have 85% of the enlisted personnel. The training is emphasizing civic action and public relations, and an excellent augury for the future is the enthusiasm which the police command itself is showing for the program.</p>
                        <p>As far as urban riot control capability is concerned, there is some distance yet to travel. The former riot control organization had been of first-class quality, but most of its personnel had been liquidated during the troubles. Training was going ahead, but essential equipment was slow in arriving from the United States. The fault here, both Phillips and <persName corresp="#p_BWV1">Broe</persName> indicated, lay with <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Washington.<note n="3" xml:id="d147fn3">At this point the words “with <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>” are underlined and “To be expected of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>!” was handwritten in the margin.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The DNI (National Intelligence Service) was starting from scratch, but there were grounds for confidence. It had a good leader, and furthermore <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> was its firm supporter because of the very good and accurate information it had given him on the recent rightist uprising in Santiago.</p>
                        <p>In sum, it looked as if the Dominican security forces would be able to keep control of the situation when the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> pulled out. It was almost sure that there will be some re-action from the Communist Party if <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> wins the election, but it presumably can be contained.</p>

                            <item>The provisional government in the Dominican Republic has achieved a fragile stability after a turbulent break-in period. Many moderates and conservatives both in civilian and military life have developed a degree of confidence in the regime—confidence that was badly lacking in mid-October. The continuing series of concessions made to the left appear to have helped achieve <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Hector Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs purpose—the bloodless elimination of the rebel-held zone. The government now controls the country and most politically minded Dominicans feel it will survive until the elections slated for 1 June. Under these circumstances, <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> will probably pursue more balanced policies designed to reconcile the two still hostile factions that contested the civil war.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Nevertheless, the provisional government remains a government without popular support, bolstered largely by the Inter-American Peace Force. The regimeʼs mode has proven to be compromise but extremist forces of both the left and right remain willing and probably able to mount widespread terrorism if they feel threatened. The Communists have made inroads—most notably in the labor field and among students—from which they may prove difficult to dislodge. The same animosities which tore the country apart in April 1965 remain—magnified by the revolt itself, but now muted at least temporarily. It remains to be seen whether the present government can provide the conditions necessary for holding elections in June of 1966 and whether if such elections are held the results will be accepted by the Dominican people without a fresh outburst of violence.</item>

                            <item>In mid-October the regime was on shaky ground. The appointment of a number of leftists to leading positions in the government and <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs responsiveness to rebel demands alienated <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0387"/>moderates, the military and other conservative elements whose dismay was fanned by the slow pace of collecting arms and reducing the rebel zone in Santo Domingo. Rumors that the military chiefs were to be replaced, coming after the ouster of General Wessin, brought the military to the point of rebellion. Both the extreme left and right attempted to exacerbate civil-military tension.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Since then, the short-term outlook has improved—a development not all directly attributable to the provisional government. During the last 60 days the “unity of the left” has come undone. The Communists have failed to mount effectively large demonstrations and strikes, in part because non-Communist left-wing politicians have judged that for the time being, at least, support of the provisional regime is in their best interest. The failure of a disorganized rightist attempt to set up in Santiago an alternative to the provisional government has reduced the appetites of conservatives for conspiracy. The firm action of the Inter-American Peace Force in opening up the rebel zone capped <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs torturously slow approach to the enforcement of the peace terms. This and the quick end of the Santiago conspiracy contributed to the public consensus that the provisional government will remain in power until elections.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> is now demonstrating that his regime is capable of governing and at the same time is increasingly confident of his own abilities. He also appears to be exercising a closer degree of control over many of his appointees and is injecting himself into policy making in such areas as labor relations. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs actions in setting elections for 1 June 1966 and filling vacancies of the three man electoral board with two moderates have contributed to a psychological atmosphere in which many politicians look to the future.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>In the field of government staffing, <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> has taken the step of removing the most influential and objectionable appointee, former Attorney General Manuel Morel Cerda. Morelʼs successor, Gustavo Gomez Ceara, has begun to moderate the influence of leftists in the legal area. In addition, <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> has given assurances that Gomez will remove many of Morelʼs undesirable appointees. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> has promised other staffing changes that will prove beneficial—such as the removal by the Supreme Court of several extremists it appointed to judgeships and the transfer of Franklin Dominguez, a militant rebel who is now the Presidentʼs Press Secretary. It should be recognized, however, that continued confidence in the regime by conservative civilians and the military will be to some degree dependent on <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs fulfilling these promises and closely supervising those undesirable appointees who remain in office.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>A heartening development has been <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs interest in developing effective security services designed to control and combat <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0388"/>internal subversion. He has appointed two competent officers to head the Department of National Investigations (DNI), the organization charged with internal security and the Department of Special Operations in the National Police responsible for counterinsurgency. The heads of the two organizations were chosen by <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> on the recommendation of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> officials and he has adopted <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ideas for their organization and mission. The DNI has already begun checking on the loyalty of some 1,500 government employees and will hopefully serve as a channel to alert <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> to the extent of extremist penetration of his government.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>The Dominican military appears to be united behind the present armed forcesʼ chiefs. Relations between President <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> and the military leaders have improved but remain tenuous. However, both right and leftwing political groups have and will probably continue their attempts to exacerbate tension between the president and the military. The militaryʼs opinion of the president has steadily improved since late October as <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> has demonstrated his ability to govern and shown himself not subservient to leftist forces. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> has also apparently realized that he has little to gain by precipitously replacing the present service chiefs and secretary of the armed forces who have proved relatively effective and loyal under the circumstances. In any event the presence of the Inter-American Peace Force, now numbering about 7,000, supporting the provisional government, severely limits the Dominican armed forcesʼ freedom of action.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>The countryʼs two leading political parties, the Reformist Party (<gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>) and the Dominican Revolutionary Party (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>) are warming up for the national elections. Although campaigning is supposedly limited to the period three months prior to elections, according to the governing Institutional Act, most Dominican politicians have now turned their efforts toward the election. Former President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName>, who heads the (<gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>, announced his candidacy in July and has begun making public appearances and speeches throughout the country. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>ʼs <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> has still to announce its candidate but it is probable that if the party takes part in the elections, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> will be its candidate. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> is presently undergoing internal strife as former party leader Angel Miolan and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> feud over party leadership. The third ranking National Civic Union (<gloss target="#t_UCN1">UCN</gloss>) appears moribund and the numerous micro-parties are jockeying for alliances. The outlawed Communist parties will probably not be allowed to participate in the elections.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>Living conditions, never satisfactory for the greater majority of Dominicans, have already returned to normal. Santo Domingoʼs shops, restaurants, and commercial institutions most of which are located in the former rebel zone, are now open, but prices are high. <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0389"/>Business concerns which adopted pro-revolutionary titles during the revolt have now reverted to their original names. The populace in Santo Domingo, however, appears restless and without direction. Unemployment and underemployment are high. Ship traffic to Santo Domingo, the countryʼs principal port, has resumed but a shortage of storage space is causing some problems. The demand for consumer goods, pent up during the revolt, can be expected to return the countryʼs trade balance to a deficit despite the governmentʼs efforts and lead to a shortage of foreign exchange. Living conditions in the interior of the country were largely unaffected by the revolt except for temporary shortages of food and imported goods. Unemployment, estimated at one third of the labor forces before the revolt, increased as some business concerns suspended operations and the United Fruit Company terminated its banana operations.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>Many of the basic social economic problems which beset the provisional government would have existed even if there had not been a revolt. They were exacerbated by the recent strife. It is unlikely that in the time remaining to him, <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> will be able to do more than make a modest start toward solving some of them. Nor will the holding of free elections provide a panacea.</item>

                            <item>The dismal events of last Sunday<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2">On the morning of December 19 fighting broke out between Dominican Republic Air Force troops and Constitutionalist troops in the city of Santiago, about 80 miles northwest of Santo Domingo; a number of troops on both sides were killed, but no civilians were hurt. In a December 20 memorandum to the President <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> deplored the “senseless shooting” for threatening to “endanger the fragile—yet growing—confidence which was developing between <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> and his military chiefs.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Dominican Republic, Vol. XIII, 11/65–1/66)</note> in Santiago have gravely sharpened existing animosities in the Dominican Republic. President <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs efforts to create an atmosphere conducive to national elections in the spring have received a severe jolt. Indeed, the restoration in Santo Domingo and maintenance of tranquility will continue to depend almost entirely on the presence of the Inter-American Peace Force (<gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>).

                            <item>It is still not clear who set off the bloody battle in Santiago—that is, to say who fired first. Both the ex-rebel lieutenants and the local military units were clearly spoiling for a fight after almost a week of tensions and country-wide labor disturbances. The President has appointed a commission of respected and moderate members of his cabinet to determine the facts in the matter. The commission is to report to him on 23 December. What the commission can usefully recommend in the current circumstances is open to question; so, too, is <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs ability to act on the facts (if they are indeed ever ascertained) rather than on the basis of the political imperatives of the moment as he sees them.</item>

                            <item>Rooting out the guilty party or parties at this point is in any event probably irrelevant.

                            <item>The rebels will be less willing than ever to divest themselves of their weapons, to break up their still-sizable military stronghold at the 27th February camp, or to place themselves at the mercy of former comrades in arms by accepting reintegration. They will appeal, and probably with some success, to other elements of the left to join them in demands for changes in the military high command, and in other actions which will exacerbate, rather than relieve, tensions.</item>

                            <item>The military commanders have recently come to a working understanding with <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>. But after the events in Santiago they will regard any effort to effect command changes as a vindication of earlier fears that the provisional President is a prisoner of the left.

He may try to make concessions all around to resolve the furor—say, by trying to relieve some of the military commanders and perhaps by finding foreign assignments for some of the top rebels. The consistently optimistic President would then probably return to the painstaking task of integrating the rebels into the military establishment. In current circumstances, however, such moves by <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> are not likely to solve the basic problems; even the mere decision to make them could provoke resistance.</item>

                            <item>We do not foresee any change in this grim prospect for months to come. There may be a pause in violence until the presidential investigatory commission has reported its findings and the President attempts to make concessions. But given the existing underlying bitterness, strikes and violence are likely in any of the larger cities—Santo Domingo in particular. The extreme left, along with the young toughs, will attempt to exacerbate these incidents through pillage, vandalism, and terror. To control these outbreaks <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> will be obliged to rely increasingly on the Inter-American Peace Force to back up his own military and police. This will pose the danger that <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> will become more identified in the popular mind with both the “foreign invaders” and the “reactionary” military. No other responsible, democratically oriented Dominican is likely to be willing to take up <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs burden for him if for any reason he should depart the scene.</item>

Like most Dominicans, both the rebels and the military believe that there are only victors and vanquished.

If the victor is <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> the chances for a return to stability would be slightly better.

                            <item>The foregoing analysis suggests three possible conclusions: a) The Dominican civil war is not over, merely contained, and not very well contained at that. b) In a context of barely suppressed violence, Communist exploitation of bitter national animosities is the only constant; its effort clearly is to polarize the political situation by turning as many non-Communists of the left against the military and police as possible. c) The policy pursued so far of attempting to unify antagonistic peoples needs the essential ingredient of time.</item>

                        <p>During the <persName>Johnson</persName> Presidency, the U.S. foreign affairs leadership reviewed and approved a covert program to help the candidate favored by the United States Government win the 1966 Dominican Republic presidential election. Having intervened militarily in April 1965 officially to “protect American lives” and unofficially to prevent a “second Cuba” in the hemisphere, the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration approved a program in 1966 to provide covert financial support and electoral information to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName> of the Partido Reformista, a moderate, pro-American party. The objective was to ensure a political climate conducive to democratic principles and simultaneously to discourage a potential Communist take-over. The 303 Committee provided interagency coordination for the covert action. Substantial financial support was passed to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> without him knowing the true source of the funds. Fearful of possible widespread criticism that its pro–<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> bias might be rigging the election, the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration encouraged <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs principal opponent to run and even <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0393"/>considered giving <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> covert financial support although on a much smaller scale than what was authorized for <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. For the United States, the operation was hugely successful—<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> won by a decisive margin and most observers attested that the election was conducted fairly, with the voting process unmarred by violence and fraud.</p>

To be frank, I thought I had written on this subject to you back in early June, but I am unable to find any record of such a memorandum among my papers. Therefore, I want to reiterate, for the record, that the President told the Director and me on more than one occasion between May and mid-July, he expected the Agency to devote the necessary personnel and material resources in the Dominican Republic required to win the presidential election for the candidate favored by the United States Government. The Presidentʼs statements were unequivocal. He wants to win the election, and he expects the Agency to arrange for this to happen.</item>

                        <p>On several occasions between May and July 1965 higher authority informed [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] that the presidential election in the Dominican Republic simply must be won by the candidate favored by the U.S. Government [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].

As of this writing, policy guidance is not yet available on whether or not there should be an election operation nor in whose favor such an operation should be conducted.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum solicits 303 Committee action to determine, first, the identity of the candidate favored by the U.S. Government and second, whether a covert operation should be undertaken on his behalf.

                                <p>The issues which divided the Dominican Republic at the outset of the rebellion have not been resolved, but the Provisional Government of <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Hector Garcia Godoy</persName> has made some progress in its task of reconciliation. It has reopened the divided city of Santo Domingo, eliminated the rebel zone, and established machinery for the peaceful reintegration of the rebel military and for the collection of arms. On 1 December the Provisional Government announced Law No. 69, which sets 1 June 1966 as the date for general elections for president, vice-president, both houses of congress, mayors and members of city councils, and establishes a central electoral board with appropriate dependencies to direct the electoral process. The Provisional Government has also asked the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> to appoint a commission to supervise the elections and this commission has now been formed. It now appears probable that the Provisional Government will complete its nine-month term and that elections will be held on schedule. Pre-election activities are already under way, although formal political campaigning cannot legally begin prior to 1 March.</p>
                                <p>Although the holding of peaceful elections is of great importance to the United States as well as the Dominican Republic, real security can come only from fundamental changes in the Dominican society and economy. In looking forward it is clear that two ingredients are essential: stability, to heal the scars of a violent and lingering revolution; and reform, to correct social inequities and rigidities and to develop national resources.</p>
                                <p>In November a nation-wide survey of Dominican public opinion was conducted<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">See <ref target="#d146">Document 146</ref>.</note> [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] indicated that 64% of all Dominicans believe that the arrival of American troops helped rather than hurt them, and also provided an assessment of the relative popularity of political parties and potential presidential candidates. The poll shows that only two political parties have sufficient popular support to compete for the presidency: the Partido Reformista (<gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>), headed by <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName>, which was preferred by 42% of the population, and the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>), headed by <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>, which was selected as “best party” by 28% of the people. The ratings of the two leading individual candidates showed <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>
                                    <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0396"/>preferred by 51% of the country and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> by 22%. (A similar poll taken in February 1965 showed <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> preferred by 42% and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> by 25%.)</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> remains silent on whether he will be a candidate. He fears assassination, and prefers to remain under the protection of his armed bodyguards rather than to tour the countryside. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> also believes that the Dominican military would try to prevent him from taking office if he were elected. He must therefore make up his mind whether to run himself, to select another candidate to carry the party banner, or to order the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> to boycott the elections. Since an electoral boycott would be unpopular and could weaken the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> considerably, and since no <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> leader loyal to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has emerged who appears capable of rallying the party behind him, internal party pressures may force <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> to campaign. If he does, he will be a formidable candidate, whose charisma and forensic ability may enable him to regain much of the popularity he lost when he failed to return to lead the rebellion launched in his name.</p>
                                <p>An assessment of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs character, motivation, past performance and campaign platform indicates that he is, by local standards, a good executive and administrator, politically astute, in favor of democratic processes, opposed to violence, and moderate in his comments on and attitudes toward the U.S. His recent speeches, including the 28 November address which launched the <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>ʼs first major political rally in Santiago de los Caballeros, have stressed the need to extinguish the fires of hatred lit by the revolution so that the country can embark on much needed social reforms. The <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>ʼs campaign slogan and party motto is “Neither injustices nor privileges.” Although <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs campaign stresses the responsibility of government to fight unemployment, hunger and other social ills, he is believed to feel that any lasting social reforms must be based on renewed popular respect for civil authority and that his first and most difficult task, if elected, will be to restore law and order.</p>

Your reports and those of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> indicate deteriorating political and military situation. We would appreciate urgently your recommendations on arresting deterioration and views on following questions and ideas:</p>
                        <p>Would it help if <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> were told he would have full cooperation and assistance of <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> in carrying out his plan as was done in case of Wessin?

                        <p>Would it assist in departure of de los Santos if we could arrange VIP visit to United States? De los Santos could join the group going to Israel after visit to U.S. as Chief of Dominican Air Force. Would it help if we could arrange VIP visit for any of the other military chiefs understanding that they would return to the Dominican Republic at end of short visit to United States? Likewise, would <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>ʼs departure and possibly that of Montes Arache be facilitated if they were to receive appropriate invitation for short orientation visit to U.S.? We think that political risks of having <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> come here would probably outweigh advantages of invitation for short orientation visit but do you think such invitation would make it easier for him to leave Dominican Republic?</p>

                            <item>President called me to palace late this afternoon and, in grim mood, informed me that he had decided take drastic action to break impasse over departure of military from both sides. He said that after considerable reflection he had reached conclusion it absolutely essential to remove three armed forcesʼ chiefs as well as constitutionalist military leaders. He therefore planned issue decrees tomorrow assigning Rivera Caminero, De Los Santos and Martinez Arana to posts abroad. Simultaneous decrees would also order <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>, Montes Arache et al. to foreign assignments. Jimenez would be named <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>, Colonel Enrique Perez y Perez Army <gloss target="#t_CS1">C/S</gloss>, Captain Amiama Castillo Navy <gloss target="#t_CS1">C/S</gloss> and Colonel Beauchamps Javier (reportedly now in Lima) Air Force <gloss target="#t_CS1">C/S</gloss>.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> insisted that only way for PG effectively to govern and take country to elections is through thorough shake-up of top level armed forces. President asserted that, in fact, he is unable to govern outside of limited economic areas. Chiefs ignore his wishes, operate armed forces as “independent power” and obstruct other officials of government in their duties. Attorney General Gomez Ceara finding that he is powerless act in any matter that touches military or involves persons protected by the military, has offered his resignation. Mendez Nunez, “best man in cabinet,” also will resign if armed forces not brought under control. Others, it was indicated, could probably be expected take this position. If he does not move, President claimed, PG will collapse.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> then listed a number of grievances against chiefs—duplicity by Rivera Caminero in responding to orders for transfer of troublesome local commanders, apparent stealing by Martinez Arana, inflicting of indignities by military on visitors to Presidentʼs office and house, and generally arrogant attitude all around. Principal complaint, as before, was that chiefs seemed to be protecting terrorists in and out of military ranks.</item>

                            <item>Larger political issues also involved. According to President, responsible moderates and conservatives have been urging him make <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0399"/>clean sweep of leading military on both sides. (In addition to Cabinet members of this category, he mentioned in this connection Salvador Ortiz and Virgilio Perez Bernal, a prominent local builder.) President said he convinced <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> shares this view and may even so state publicly. (We have conflicting reports on this question.) Finally, in <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs opinion, country looks to him to open way to elections. Under present circumstances elections would be impossible, as Central Electoral Board President Liz has allegedly stated in private. President concluded, therefore, that only by solving countryʼs major problem—that of the contending military factions—could he create climate for elections.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> conceded that it might appear he was acting in response to pressure from <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and extreme left. Nevertheless, he thought removal from scene of constitutionalist military would ultimately weaken <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs hand. As matters now stand, he said, <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> can be expected to reap maximum advantage from anti-military sentiment in country. This would obviously no longer be case if issue of military leaders resolved. (I pointed out that these are highly debatable points; that, in particular, we have evidence <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> himself has put forward idea of trading <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> and company for chiefs.)</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>In conclusion, President said he fully realized possibly grave consequences of his decision. Chiefs might simply ignore or refuse obey his orders when decrees published. He would then have no choice but to resign, offering turn government over to armed forces in event Vice President Castillo and other cabinet officers followed his lead. Outcome, President thought, would depend to large degree on attitude of <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> and ad hoc committee. It was his opinion that with these behind him chiefs would not challenge orders.</item>

                            <item>I responded to this presentation with observation that Presidentʼs scheme obviously held certain attractions in theory but question had to be answered as to how it would work out in practice. His objective—and ours—is to hold free elections. Great progress had been made in preparing way until unfortunate events in Santiago. Did this setback, I asked, mean that President should abandon gradualist approach that had achieved so much before December 19? Would it not be better part of wisdom to take action re military on both sides in at least two stages as we had previously suggested? Presidentʼs reply, in effect was that his decision now made and could not be changed.</item>

                            <item>I did prevail on <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> to hold off until my colleagues could be brought down from Washington, promising him that we would do utmost have them here by noon tomorrow. I have not so far been able to reach either Penna Marinho or Duenas but hope schedule can be met. Few minutes ago, when I reassured <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> by telephone on this point, he informed me that Cabinet meeting now in session and it appeared “decision final”.</item>

                            <item>Full ad hoc committee met with <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> for more than two hours this afternoon. President had just concluded session with Rivera Caminero at which he made “one last appeal” for cooperation in making changes in military high command. According <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>, Riveraʼs answer was flat no. <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> explained that even if he might personally wish to cooperate, other officers would not permit him do so. Rivera warned that if President changed so much as one chief, armed forces would act throughout country and not “a single Communist would remain alive”.

                                <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> said he could see no way out of impasse. Rivera had refused his offer turn government over to armed forces. <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> also insisted there would be no military golpe. Chiefs would simply ignore presidentʼs orders. Meanwhile, best cabinet ministers, governors and other government officials prepared resign at any moment. President said he could find himself without a government tomorrow morning. He would not act as mere “figurehead for military” and could, therefore, only resign. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> suggested that committee might wish discuss with Vice President Castillo possibility of forming new administration. <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0402"/>He indicated, however, that he doubted Castillo would take over with chiefs still in place.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> dwelt at length on alarming possibilities of anarchy and violence if satisfactory solution not found. (Only solution he will so far admit to be satisfactory is removal of chiefs.) He recognized that resignation of PG would bring grave risks in that regard but thought this step would be better than permitting PG to become identified with military repression of civil populace. President repeatedly emphasized his conviction that rising wave of anti-military sentiment (Embassy [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] lack reports of such tidal wave in general populace) makes it impossible to continue status quo.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>We explored various possibilities with <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>, including proposal that committee sit down with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> (with President perhaps present) to attempt hammer out agreement of two major parties to back PG and help devise formula to resolve crisis. President seemed lukewarm to that idea. In his view, committee could best help by trying to persuade Jimenez, Perez y Perez and Beauchamps to accept respective posts in replacement of Rivera, Martinez Arana and De Los Santos. Jimenez, according to <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>, had first let it be known that he would accept but later sent word that his “brotherly” relations with chiefs made it impossible. We indicated our intention talk to military leaders but made no other commitments.</item>

This paper requested that the 303 Committee identify the presidential candidate favored by the U.S. Government and that a decision be taken as to whether a covert election operation should be undertaken on this candidateʼs behalf. The minutes of the 303 Committee meeting indicate agreement that the only visible candidate to support is <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName>, president of the Partido Reformist (<gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>). The 303 Committee decided to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] to prepare a contingency plan for an election operation in support of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, stressing those aspects needing the longest lead time, for presentation at the next 303 Committee meeting. The following contingency plan is submitted in response to this request.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">2. Concept of the Operation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The purpose of the projected operation is to provide essential support to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs campaign; its implementation must be guided by certain basic considerations.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First, it is essential that the operation be carried out in such a way that United States sponsorship cannot be proven in any way. Two factors enter here: (a) the U.S. is already believed to favor <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and will be accused of supporting him regardless of its real actions; (b) the exposure of actual facts of U.S. support would be nonetheless damaging both to the U.S. and to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. Normal operating conditions in the goldfish bowl environment of Santo Domingo present difficult security <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0404"/>problems. Such problems will be further complicated by the international attention and interest which will be focused to an unprecedented degree on the Dominican elections.</item>
                            <item>Second, while <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will need financial help as well as assistance in other forms in order to overcome certain handicaps, the amount of assistance given him must be controlled to avoid overweight. His campaign should be lean and hungry and his party organization should exert itself to the utmost in order to achieve the necessary degree of efficiency and at the same time hold to a minimum the inevitable accusations that he is getting help from non-Dominican sources.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In addition to money, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will need help in the form of advice and information. [<hi rend="italic">7 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (11½ lines of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>In sum, three kinds of support to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> are envisioned: (1) funds to be provided [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]; (2) information, expertise and political guidance relayed through reliable intermediaries whom <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> trusts; (3) development of media and other assets having a natural bias toward <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> or toward his platform. In the application of this support the guiding principle will be to tightly control the amount of aid and the manner in which it is given in order to prevent the aid from becoming apparent and to keep <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs campaign organization lean and aggressive.</p>

He has expressed growing concern over the number of adherents of the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>), the opposition party led by <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>, who occupy government positions at all levels. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has pointed out that these positions enable the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> to influence the thinking of the campesinos, who traditionally do as they are told by the government, as well as to buy votes with jobs and to use government money, transportation and equipment for partisan political purposes. He said that the <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> has limited financial resources and is finding itself unable to compete with the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> under these conditions. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has also told his party leaders that the <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> may not be able to compete effectively in the elections unless additional funds can be acquired.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> began to lay the groundwork for his campaign as early as 2 October 1965 when teams of party leaders began travelling to <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0405"/>population centers throughout the interior. Although formal campaigning cannot begin prior to 1 March, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is already touring the countryside and has held one major political rally in Santiago de los Caballeros on 28 November 1965. He intends to devote the early stages of his campaign to the interior, ending with a strong finish in the capital during the final 45 days prior to the election. His party has had considerable success in its efforts to increase its membership through inscription drives and to lay the organizational groundwork for the coming campaign, but is having difficulty in raising new funds and even in collecting financial pledges on which it had relied. Propaganda and public relations mechanisms as well as other campaign necessities such as transportation are still lacking, are expensive to acquire, and obviously need time to develop and coordinate if they are to contribute effectively to the party campaign.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Ellsworth Bunker</persName> reports that <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> is making slow but continuing progress in persuading the Army and Air Force Chiefs to step down. In talks yesterday, Army Chief Martinez Arana indicated his willingness to retire rather than to accept a post on the Armed Forces General Staff, as <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> had offered. Air Chief de los Santos is still holding out, but his confidence may have been shaken. Behind <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs progress has been his success in winning the support of an important group of ranking officers who are far-sighted enough to see that the interest of the Armed Forces are better served by meeting <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs wishes rather than by risking a clash.</p>
                        <p>Talks with the two Chiefs are continuing this morning. <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Ellsworth</persName>, as of noon, did not have a reading on how they had gone. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> cancelled his radio-TV speech last night in the hopes that he can go on <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0409"/>the air tonight and announce that the problem of the Chiefs has been resolved. <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Ellsworth</persName> is not at all sure that he will be able to do this.</p>

                        <p>As we approach the start of electoral period, our [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] FBI sources in Santo Domingo are picking up an increasing number of reports that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would like to see the elections postponed for several months because of what he describes as the existing state of political insecurity. We have also received several reports that <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> would be interested in a plebiscite to extend the life of the Provisional Government for a couple of years, believing that neither <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> could provide stability. It is very likely that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would like to have more time in which to recoup some of his losses.

                        <p>In my judgment there are now grounds for cautious optimism with respect to the chances of holding satisfactory elections in the Dominican Republic on June 1 as scheduled.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> has made it clear that he considers the politico-military crisis which began December 19 with the Hotel Matum incident to have ended February 26 on the swearing-in of new Army and Air Force Chiefs.<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2">In telegram 1994 from Santo Domingo, February 25, <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> and high-level military officers had agreed to a formula to solve the military composition problem. The formula called for De Los Santos and Martinez to be “promoted” to Vice Ministers of Armed Forces and for Osiris Perdomo to be the new Army Chief, and Juan Folch Perez to be the new Air Force Chief. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, DEF 6 DOM REP)</note> In his view, these and the previous changes in the high commands of the Armed Forces and the Police will make it possible to ensure an attitude of impartiality and obedience to civil authority during the campaign period on the part of the military establishment. I see no reason why this should not be true, particularly given the qualities of leadership and political moderation already displayed by the new Minister of the Armed Forces and the new Chief of the National Police.</p>
                        <p>Another encouraging development is the fact that political leaders and the people as a whole have obviously become increasingly convinced that the elections will be held. Right-wing parties (including notably the National Civic Union) which previously specialized in conspiracies to overthrow the Provisional Government have now announced plans to participate in the elections. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs Reformist Party is already engaged in full-scale campaigning and the rightist group behind the candidacy of ex-President Bonnelly has begun canvassing in the northern part of the country. We are presently completing arrangements to assure that the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Electoral Advisory Commission is on the ground during the entire campaign period. The Inter-American Human Rights Commission will also maintain a presence and is considering a plan to bring all its members to the Dominican Republic for the month of May.</p>
                        <p>The two principal problems remaining are the threat of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> to boycott the elections and the continuing danger that violence and terrorism will disrupt the campaign. These two problems are closely related. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> asserts almost daily that a systematic campaign of violence is being carried out against his followers. Although there is a strong element of exaggeration in his charges, it is true that members of his party and other “Constitutionalists” have been harassed, beaten and even killed for their political beliefs. In addition, there appears to be little doubt that members of the Armed Forces and National Police have been involved in these outrages.</p>
                        <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0411"/>
                        <p>We believe it most important that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs party, the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, participate in the elections in order to make them meaningful and acceptable to the largest possible number of Dominicans. (In our view it would be satisfactory and perhaps even desirable if someone other than <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> were to be the presidential candidate, although there seems to be little chance of his giving way. It might also be possible to live with elections in which there was no <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> presidential candidate but in which the party did participate on the local and congressional levels.) <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> is also anxious to have the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> go to elections and, while recognizing that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> may continue threatening abstention as a political tactic, wants to do what can be done to eliminate legitimate causes for alleging that a proper electoral climate does not exist.</p>
                        <p>Shootings and other acts of violence will, of course, continue. With so many weapons in the hands of civilians and such a large residue of hate from the civil war, nothing else can be expected. Nevertheless, I believe <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> can establish, with our cooperation and that of his military leaders, minimal conditions necessary for free campaigning. We are presently working with him on arrangements to ensure adequate Armed Forcesʼ backing for the National Police in the event the extreme left is again able to provoke serious disturbances in downtown Santo Domingo. (It is our hope that the Inter-American Peace Force can ultimately be relegated to the role of a backup only to be called upon in extreme emergencies.) We will also continue to press him on the need to take decisive action to end right-wing terrorism.</p>
                        <p>If all goes well and we get to election on schedule, I estimate <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs chances to be good. Although Bonnelly will obviously take votes away from him on the right, the formerʼs entry into the campaign gives <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> the opportunity to come out as the candidate of the center where most of the votes are probably to be found. In any event, I believe we must continue our intensive efforts to bring off the elections on schedule. There is no other acceptable way to resolve our short-term problems in the Dominican Republic. I also believe that our interests will best be served by the earliest possible withdrawal of the Inter-American Peace Force following the installation of an elected government.</p>

                            <item>The writer raised the point that the most important basic aspects of the election were to be sure that <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia-Godoy</persName> carried out the election in line with the Institutional Act and; secondly, the need to get out the vote, especially in the rural areas. The writer discussed the voting situation in great detail including the election carnet problem; need for use of indelible ink; lack of support to the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Election Commission; the personality of Angel Liz;<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">Secretary of State for Justice under the Council of State that governed the Dominican Republic from 1962 until February 27, 1963.</note> need for a Dominican civic group to support the governmentʼs efforts in the election, etc. The need to put continual pressure on <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia-Godoy</persName> was emphasized as it was quite <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0413"/>evident Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> believes the election procedures are on track and <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia-Godoy</persName> has the situation in hand.

It was agreed the most important issue was to have <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> participation in any event. It was agreed that probably <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> could not get the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> out of the race but a boycott by him or a partial boycott by the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> would be highly undesirable. The writer stressed all of the unfortunate aspects of a <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> victory to the U.S. and to the future stability of the Dominican Republic. It is interesting to note that, not in rebuttal to the above, but later in the conversation, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> opined that if <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> was elected the new military could work out a modus vivendi with him. The Ambassador also stated he believed <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> had “learned from a previous experience” and would comport accordingly, if elected.</item>

                            <item>There was a general discussion as to methods to be used to keep <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> in the presidential race. Approaches to Venezuela, Oduber, <persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">Figueres</persName>, the Mexican Government and possibly Frei to ask them to urge <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> to stay in the race were discussed. The writer pointed out that this was dangerous business, especially to the Venezuelans as they could get the impression we favored <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and pour in substantial support. Up to now, the Venezuelans had kept hands off as they have been disgusted with the <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>/Miolan bickering. <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> will consider such approaches. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> suggested that we pay <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> to stay in the race. He felt that a sum in the neighborhood of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] would suffice. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SRM1">Sayre</persName> and the writer opposed this. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> stated that he would like to explore the feasibility of this [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>].<note n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">In an April 7 memorandum to the Deputy Director for Intelligence, <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> clarified this issue: “I agree with you that the minutes of the 303 meeting of 28 March 1966 are somewhat unclear on the question of support to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. ‘On the problem of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, it was agreed that <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> would sound out the possibility of soliciting the support of other countries to keep him from pulling out.ʼ This reference overtook the previous suggestion that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> would explore the possibility of getting some money to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. In sum, there is no question of the United States Government clandestinely funding <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs campaign.” <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> continued, “I am aware of the dangers a <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> victory would entail, but every effort is being made to see this does not happen. There is general agreement that the best course is to have <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> run initially, and if he withdraws with a cry of fraud, there is nothing that can be done about it.” No record of the March 28 303 Committee meeting has been found.

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> telephoned on the morning of March 17 to report on a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> last night at the latterʼs home outside Santo Domingo.<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">In telegram 2126 from Santo Domingo, March 16, <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> summarized for the President his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> earlier that day. (Ibid., POL 14 DOM REP)</note> The Ambassador said that the meeting he and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName> had with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> late yesterday afternoon was cordial, with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> conducting himself with dignity.</p>
                        <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0415"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> went into considerable detail about the forthcoming elections. He explained that the United States Government and the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> were doing their utmost to assist Provisional President <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> in creating a climate which would permit all candidates to campaign freely. He said that the President, the vice-president, the chiefs of the armed forces and police are eager to see that the proper conditions can be established and are working to this end, especially in impressing upon the armed forces the necessity of being impartial and aloof from political activity. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> said this could not be done overnight, but that great progress had been made. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> agreed that conditions had improved.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> informed Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> electoral commission will return to the Dominican Republic on Monday<note n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">March 21.</note> and that full membership of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Inter-American Human Rights Committee would be arriving in May with considerable additional personnel.</p>
                        <p>It is the policy of the United States Government, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> said, that it will recognize and support a freely elected government, and he was certain that he spoke for all <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> members in declaring this too was their policy. He said the United States had no favorite among the presidential candidates and fully expected that the voters could make their choice on June 1 without fear or hindrance. It is our hope, the Ambassador added, that a democratic, constitutional government will be installed on July 1.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, while admitting progress, did not think there was time enough to achieve the necessary climate for elections by June 1. For instance, he was not certain that his <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> could safely hold a convention of 500 people in Santo Domingo to choose their candidates. Asked why the convention could not be held elsewhere, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> said other cities did not have adequate convention facilities. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> expressed the belief that if it were made a matter of pride in carrying out their responsibilities, the Provisional President and Secretary of the Armed Forces would provide the necessary security, even if it involved use of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> said the holding of the convention was a great responsibility for him and he feared the communists might resort to violence with the large quantity of weapons they have in their possession. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> reminded Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> that part of the responsibility for the large number of loose weapons rested with Col. <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>, who had deceived the Provisional President when the latter tried to collect them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> did not commit himself the one way or the other about the chances of <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> participating in the campaign.</p>
                        <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0416"/>
                        <p>(Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> reported, however, that the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> is campaigning all over the country at present. He also reported that President <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> had issued a decree last night cancelling the commissions of a number of civilians “assimilated” into the military. Among the persons affected is Maximo Fiallo. He also stated that the government had begun to replace with police private guards who have been protecting Manolo Bordas, <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, and <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Hector Aristy</persName>, promoter of the 24th of April movement. This is the first step in replacing private armed personnel with police for other prominent Dominicans.)</p>

                                <item>—The pollʼs percentages are based on the assumption that the population of <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> voters does not differ significantly from the population of <hi rend="italic">eligible</hi> voters.<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">Komer commented on this p <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> graph and wrote the following note at the bottom of the page: “Iʼm asking <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> to look at pros and cons of surfacing this.”</note>

                            <item>Current Situation in the Dominican Republic</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>A number of factors have contributed to a gradual but steady improvement in the situation since the date of my last report, March 7.<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> originally dated his memorandum March 7. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, S/S Country Files: Lot 70 D 209, Dominican Republic) An identical copy that went to the President was dated March 9; see <ref target="#d162">Document 162</ref>.</note> I believe that the grounds for cautious optimism with respect to the chances of holding elections on June 1 which I then expressed have been further strengthened.</p>
                        <p>Acts of terrorism and violence have markedly declined. The new Minister of the Armed Forces and the Chief of the National Police have <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0418"/>made it clear, through their public pronouncements and their actions, that they are determined that their respective Services shall maintain an attitude of strict impartiality and discipline throughout the electoral period, that they shall remain aloof from political activities of any kind, and shall be responsive to civil authority. Changes in local commands have been made where there has been evidence of lack of adequate cooperation. The National Police have initiated and continue a search for weapons in the hands of civilians and almost daily report recoveries of weapons and ammunition. I believe that, barring some now unforeseen acts of violence by the extremes of either Left or Right, the atmosphere of tranquility which now prevails can be maintained.</p>
                        <p>There is growing evidence that the people as a whole not only want to see elections take place on June 1 but have become increasingly convinced the elections will be held. Despite doubts expressed by <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> a short time ago that the climate in the city of Santo Domingo was sufficiently tranquil to enable his Party (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>) to hold its convention,<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">See <ref target="#d164">Document 164</ref>.</note> he announced on March 18 that the Party convention would be held in Santo Domingo on April 9–10 and would then determine whether or not to participate in the elections. It is my opinion that pressure building up within the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> will lead to a decision to participate in the elections with or without <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> as a presidential candidate. I believe that it is important that it should do so in order to make the elections meaningful and acceptable to the largest possible number of Dominicans. Another Party, the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> (Social Christian Revolutionary Party) has also announced that it intends to participate in the elections and will hold its convention on April 3 to decide on its candidates.</p>
                        <p>A further development which has contributed to stability and tranquility is the departure of a substantial number of ex-constitutionalist military either to posts or training abroad. By the end of this week all of the high-ranking ex-constitutionalist officers with the exception of the Camp Commander will have left the 27th of February Camp for posts abroad. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> hopes to be able to close out the Camp, the personnel of which now consists almost entirely of enlisted men and non-commissioned officers, by offering the remaining personnel pay with leave of absence until the elected government takes office, and seems confident that the offer will be accepted.</p>
                        <p>Within a generally more optimistic frame for the country as a whole, the University remains a matter for concern, the new Rector and Administration having confirmed a substantial number of extreme leftist professors. Because of the University autonomy, established both by law and generally by tradition in Latin America, the problem of correcting <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0419"/>the situation will be a difficult one for the incoming Administration. It is possible, however, that since a new Constitution must be written after the elected government takes over, the problem can be coped with at that time.</p>
                        <p>If the present climate prevails and we get to elections on schedule, I continue to estimate that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs chances are good. He remains, I believe, more than ever the candidate of the center where most of the votes are probably to be found. While Bonnelly will take votes away from him on the right, the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>, if it runs an independent ticket as now seems probable, should detract from the votes of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs party (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>). The 14th of June Movement, declared illegal in December, 1963, has petitioned the Central Electoral Board for recognition as a political party. The Board has declared a decision outside its competence and has referred the matter to the President.</p>
                        <p>In view of the favorable electoral climate created by the situation described above, I believe that we must continue our intensive efforts to bring off the elections on schedule. Toward this objective, members of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Electoral Commission are already in the Dominican Republic, <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> observers who will witness the voting process are being recruited and, at the invitation of <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>, we are cooperating in the preparation and dissemination of publicity directed toward getting out the largest possible vote.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned in my previous memorandum, I believe that our interests will best be served by the earliest possible withdrawal of the Inter-American Peace Force. Depending on the outcome of the elections, it may be possible to withdraw the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> before the elected government is installed. If this is not possible, we should look toward its withdrawal as soon as possible following the installation of the elected government.</p>

There was some talk about how <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName> might be prevented from returning, but no really helpful thought was advanced.<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">In an April 4 memorandum <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> informed the President of <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName>ʼs interest in returning to the Dominican Republic and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs statement to a U.S. source that he intended to propose to the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> that it nominate <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> to run for President in his place. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> discounted <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs statement and thought the danger of <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName>ʼs running would be the “disruptive influence that it would have on the presently good and improving electoral climate.” In terms of the elections themselves, he would adversely affect <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs chances only if he were to become <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs running mate.

[<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] Gardner gathered during the discussion the poll still puts <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> ahead by almost the same measure as before, and that the <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0421"/>conservative movement for National Integration (MIN) candidate, Raphael Bonnelly, had moved up from 1% to 3½%.

The principal reason for the break in the series of terroristic attacks was the new chief of police, who had clamped down firmly on the rightists. Phillips pointed out that the rightists had consistently directed their attacks against the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>; there was not one instance of an attempt against a Communist.</item>

                                <item>There was agreement that we were working with a delicate problem—giving substantial support to a candidate (<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>) who did not know that he was getting it.</item>

The uncertain point was whether <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would run himself.

Even with continuing infusions of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid and other external credit assistance, the Dominican economy in 1966 and 1967 is unlikely to do much more than regain pre–1965 levels. The government will almost certainly take some tentative steps toward agricultural development, improved education, and more efficient operations in the large state-owned sector of the economy; however, reform measures of the type required for sustained economic growth can hardly be implemented without a prolonged period of political stability.</item>

When the country has been independent, it has known only turmoil and civil war or military dictatorship. Repressive and brutal rule have been the norm, and life has been held cheap.

                            <item>The last dictatorial rule—the 30 years of Trujillo which ended only with his assassination in 1961—left a particularly deep imprint. The Trujillo reign not only prevented the development of political leaders and normal political life; it bred fresh hatreds and held back progress in nearly every sphere, except the economic, where there was modest growth. Much of the economic progress was designed for show, however, or was for the benefit of the Trujillo family or close associates, and did little to improve the welfare of the average Dominican. <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0426"/>Partly as a result of the Trujillo era, the political fabric is permeated with mutual distrust, and there is a wide gulf between the small upper-class minority and the great bulk of the population, which is ignorant and poverty-stricken. Dissatisfaction has increased as the Dominican peasants and workers have become more aware of their underprivileged condition.</item>

Less than half the Dominicans are literate, only about 10 percent have managed to complete elementary school, few have acquired any technical training, and there is a marked shortage of skilled workmen. Moreover, there is an acute shortage of managerial and executive talent, and generally a lack of energetic, persistent application to problems, particularly those of a routine and undramatic nature. Although almost all Dominicans have some mixture of Negro and Spanish blood, there is nevertheless a strong tendency for those of lighter skin to look down on the darker ones. The poor of the city streets are often called <hi rend="italic">negritos</hi>, and political movements seeking mass appeal sometimes refer to upper-class political groups as “the whites.”</item>

The 1960 census recorded a total population of 3,013,525, an increase of 42 percent over 1950. The current population is estimated at 3.7 million. The growth rate is 3.5 percent a year; given some improvement in present low standards of health and sanitation, this may go still higher. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> This, of course, greatly complicates any efforts to promote economic or educational progress. It also may have political effects, especially over the longer term. More than half the population is now less than 18 years old; the young people, many of them not reconciled like their parents to docile acceptance of minimal living standards, are likely to be a major force for political change.</item>

In return they received certain perquisites, including a share in Trujilloʼs institutionalized system of graft.

                            <item>The Dominican Republic is one of the poorest countries in Latin America, depending chiefly on agriculture, which accounts for 40 percent of GNP and employs two-thirds of the labor force. Its assets include some of the most fertile land in the Caribbean, a climate suitable to the cultivation of a wide range of crops, a primary road system linking all major agricultural regions, and an extensive, though poorly maintained, irrigation system in the arid western part of the country. Bauxite deposits are being mined, and there are small deposits of iron ore and nickel. The stock of other physical resources, however, is small. There are no exploitable deposits of petroleum or coal, and the hydroelectric power potential is limited. Moreover, arable land is limited in extent, and the ratio of population to arable land is one of the highest in the hemisphere. Output of the economy has been kept low by a small stock of capital (including a general lack of transportation facilities in rural areas, a lack of storage facilities at market centers, and little manufacturing capacity), by the application of only rudimentary forms of technology throughout much of industry and most of agriculture, and by a general lack of technical and managerial skills.</item>

                            <item>Dominican foreign exchange earnings and general economic activity are heavily dependent on agricultural exports, principally sugar. About two-thirds of the sugar industry is government-owned. Production costs in these state-owned sugar enterprises are so high that exports would be profitable for them only when world prices are extraordinarily high. Prices have been low since the end of 1964 and seem likely to remain so. The countryʼs vulnerability to fluctuations in export prices is increased by its heavy dependence on imports, including many important staple foods such as rice and beans, and almost all capital goods, fuels, industrial raw materials, and consumer durables.</item>

While a considerable number of Dominicans are well-off as compared with this low standard, there are no longer many families who are very rich.

                            <item>The Dominican economy, which had shown generally rapid growth in the period after World War II, has done badly since 1958. Initially, this was caused by Trujilloʼs use of an austerity program to gain foreign exchange to build up the Trujillo family fortune outside the country. The policy actions of post-Trujillo governments, which included governmental efforts to reduce unemployment by means of increased budgetary expenditures and hiring by state-owned enterprises<note n="6" xml:id="d171fn6">State enterprises in the D.R.—most of them former holdings of the Trujillo family—account for about half the countryʼs industrial capital and perhaps a fourth of the most productive agricultural land. Cuba is the only country in the hemisphere which has a higher concentration of means of production in the hands of the state. In the D.R. this has meant that government policy is the decisive factor in most economic matters and that politics and economics are more thoroughly intertwined than generally is the case. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> and which permitted a rapid rise in real wages, generated demand for goods far beyond the economyʼs capacity to produce or buy abroad. Political instability caused private investors to be reluctant to increase capacity in response to this demand. Moreover, the use of state enterprises as a “national patrimony” to provide increased employment led to sharp reductions in public sector savings and investment. A sustained period of rapid price rises and increasingly severe balance of payments difficulties ensued.</item>

                            <item>The rebellion in April 1965 made these problems more acute at the same time that it lessened the ability of the government to deal with them. The GNP dipped some 15 percent in 1965; the drop in per capita GNP was 18 percent, though the decline in individual welfare was not that severe. This was partly because of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> emergency feeding program which for several months reached 18 percent of the Dominicans. Even so, unemployment increased from perhaps 20 percent of the labor force to about 30 percent. The deficit in the governmentʼs budget rose somewhat over its level in 1963 or 1964.</item>

                            <item>A particular difficulty in 1965 which augurs ill for the future was a sharp decrease in earnings from Dominican exports—down $58 million from the $180 million total of 1964. About half the drop was caused by a decline in sugar production as a result both of the rebellion and of the low world market price. Sugar output fell from 910,000 short tons of raw sugar in 1964 to only 620,000 in 1965. However, the combination of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid<note n="7" xml:id="d171fn7">About $96 million in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid to the D.R. was disbursed in 1965.

A large proportion of the people, especially of the rural peasantry, is not politically conscious. In the D.R.ʼs first free elections in December 1962, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> polled some 58 percent of the vote; yet when the Dominican military leaders ousted <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> in September 1963, there were no significant public demonstrations of protest.

The senior military leaders did not oppose the overthrow of the <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid Cabral</persName> government at the outset of the revolt on 24–25 April. But when they realized that the coup was leading toward a restoration of President <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and the constitution of 1963, their reaction swiftly transformed the situation into a civil war, pitting the most militant elements of the left and right against each other. There is no doubt that the extreme leftists played a key role on the side of the “constitutionalists” when the fighting was at its height and that subsequently they have engaged in terrorist activities. Nor is there any doubt that elements of the extreme right have conducted terrorist operations in recent months, which have been particularly directed against members of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs Dominican Revolutionary Party (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>) and against former “constitutionalist” military figures.</item>

                            <item>In a sense, the primary contribution of the provisional government has been to provide a “cooling-off” period. That it could undertake few policy initiatives and that it could not manage a complete restoration of civil order was of less immediate importance than its ability simply to survive one crisis after another. Even to send a number of “constitutionalist” military leaders and some top-ranking officers of the regular military establishment to assignments outside the country involved a protracted struggle. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> was unable to work this out according to his original plan. He did, however, succeed in sending abroad the key “constitutionalist” officers and in making enough change in the command of the regular military to permit the installation of a new Minister of Defense, General Perez y Perez, in whom he has some confidence, and new chiefs of the army, the air force, and the police.</item>

Not only did the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and the parties of the extreme left pull away from each other, but the latter resumed quarreling among themselves about whether to use political tactics or terror and violence.

                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>, who for years was a leader of the anti-Trujillo exiles, was elected President in 1962 by an overwhelming majority, but he was then running against a much weaker opponent than <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. Barely seven months after taking office, he was swept from power by a military coup. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is the undisputed leader of the well organized Dominican Revolutionary Party (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>) which is united behind his candidacy. He is clearly the candidate of the “constitutionalists.” He is supported <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0432"/>by the radical Revolutionary Social Christians (<gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>), by the pro-Castro MR–1J4, and by the Moscow-oriented Communists (<gloss target="#t_PCD1">PCD</gloss>). However, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has sought to disassociate himself from the Communist parties, and has publicly rejected the support of the MR–1J4. The <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> and the parties of the extreme left command few votes in comparison with the <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> but still might make up the margin of difference in a close election. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> ticket has some added strength from the vice presidential candidacy of <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Antonio Guzman</persName>, who for a time was considered as a possibility for provisional president. <persName corresp="#p_GFSA1">Guzman</persName> brings no large personal following, but he will supply a certain aura of respectability.</item>

                            <item>A third presidential candidate, who appeals mainly to Dominican conservatives and rightists is Rafael Bonnelly, President of the Council of State that ruled the country in 1962, after <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs ouster. He is seeking to coordinate several right-of-center parties into a coalition called the National Integration Movement (MIN). In a contest between <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, Bonnelly can be expected to pull votes away from <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. If <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> appears to be in the lead, pressures will grow on the part of MIN and <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> supporters to unify against him. However, the ambitions of individuals in both groups, as well as the longstanding animosities between elements of the two parties make such an alliance difficult. Some MIN sponsors probably hope to use the organization as a political front behind which the military could exercise power in the event of a successful coup.</item>

                            <item>It is likely that the candidates of the two major parties will stay in the contest to the end. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is almost certain to continue in the race, but <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has at times voiced a conviction that elections are impossible owing to police and military intimidation of his party. More recently he has said that the Dominican situation is hopeless and if he should be elected the military would not let him govern. However, despite his fears, driven by his overwhelming ambition and the demands of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, which wants to ride his coat tails, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> accepted the partyʼs nomination. In the future he may threaten to withdraw his party for political effect, but barring a major interruption of the electoral process he will probably see the campaign out. If <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> should withdraw before the end of the campaign, we believe the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> will probably continue in the congressional and local elections. We are doubtful that they would try to put up a new candidate in the presidential contest.</item>

Running on reformist platforms, each has his strong points. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is identified with the peace and order of the Trujillo period, at a time when many Dominicans long for an end to upheaval and anarchy. He is probably remembered favorably among the urban lower classes for his largesse during 1961. Many Dominicans are anxious, above all, to avoid a return to the <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0433"/>violence and chaos of the 1965 rebellion; <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> appeals to them with his pledges of conciliation and unity of action. His <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> lieutenants have done some organizational work, and he himself has made a series of trips into the countryside to rally the voting groups likely to give him greatest backing. However the <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> campaign so far has not matched the vigor of the campaign of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs major advantage is his ability to appeal to the Dominican masses in terms they find understandable and attractive. As a campaigner he has unusual abilities. His general reputation for opposing the unpopular Dominican military establishment will also attract voters. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> has a powerful voice in the ministries and agencies of the Provisional Government and this influence will probably give the party considerable leverage at the polls. Should the impression that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is going to win continue to grow, he would also profit from a tendency to get on the bandwagon.</item>

                            <item>Both candidates have recognizable weaknesses. A Bonnelly candidacy will undoubtedly eat into <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs vote. On the other hand, if <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and Bonnelly were able to come to some sort of agreement, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would probably respond by trying to paint <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> as a candidate of the Dominican elite. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs identification with the violence of the recent past, and his failure in 1963 to fulfill his campaign promises, have undoubtedly disillusioned some of his potential supporters. He will probably restrict his campaigning in the interior, out of a fear of assassination, and this may hurt his chances. While it did not have this effect during the campaign of 1962, it could now give substance to a widespread belief that he is a physical coward. Another major vulnerability will probably be the susceptibility of the rural peasantry to charges that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is a Communist or Communist supporter. These charges will probably be a major weapon of the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> camp, and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is clearly worried that they will have an effect on the electorate, which though it understands little of communism, is strongly opposed to it.</item>

As a result of its intervention in April 1965 and its continuing efforts on the scene to assist the Dominicans in finding peaceful solutions, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is considered responsible for much of what happens in the country both by the Dominicans themselves and by interested observers throughout Latin America.</item>

                            <item>The new Minister of Defense Perez y Perez has stated that the Dominican military establishment will abide by the election results, whatever they are. This implies more of a change in military attitudes than we think has yet taken place. If <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> were elected, some key figures in the military would want to prevent him from taking or holding office. The continuing presence of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> would probably inhibit them from acting quickly; indeed their expectation as to when the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> might withdraw would probably be a factor in determining their timing. The dissatisfied military officers might also wish to delay action for some time so as to take advantage of some specific action of the new government which might render it unpopular or otherwise vulnerable.</item>

                            <item>If, on the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> were elected, he would begin with the acceptance of the military establishment. Moreover, he would probably manage to persuade leaders of the armed forces to go along with modest moves toward social and economic reform, even if these drew protests from rightist politicians. Initially, sharp opposition from the extreme left would improve, rather than detract from, his standing with the security forces. He might, however, lose this rapport if he used the police and army less vigorously than they thought was required to put down leftist-instigated demonstrations and violence.</item>

                            <item>One of the most arduous tasks facing any new government is to continue the gradual and delicate process of reshaping the military so that eventually it will become the servant of the government. If the president moves clumsily in this, he may provoke the very military intervention he is trying to rule out. If he acts to reduce the strength of the armed forces rapidly, he may risk loss of capability to cope with civil disorder, terrorism, or insurgency.</item>
                            <label>34.</label>
                            <item>Whatever the nature of government action, there are likely to be growing differences of attitude and political opinion within the military, and particularly within the army. Increasing numbers of younger <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0435"/>army officers, NCOs, and enlisted men will probably become antagonistic toward the countryʼs elite groups. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> has been making efforts to build influence within the military; the more extreme parties are likely to try too. Although this will tend to decrease the danger of intervention by the military establishment as a whole, it will add to the danger of a new split within the military and the alignment of military units with opposing political factions.</item>

                            <item>Given this uncertain allegiance of the Dominican military, the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> will continue, for a while at least, to be the primary stabilizing factor in the D.R. Its presence reduces the chances of a coup from the right and of insurgency from the left. Thus the chances of any Dominican government for survival will be substantially greater as long as the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> stays on. Its continued presence would, however, tend to promote exaggerated nationalism and anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> feeling, and over time might become a factor for instability. After the elections and the inauguration of the president on 1 July pressures for removal of the Force will probably increase, on the part of elements within the D.R., the Latin American governments whose troops are involved, and public opinion in the hemisphere.</item>

                            <item>We think that the staying power of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> as president would be considerably greater than that of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>; we are not confident, however, that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> could remain in office for a four-year term—or even for the period of this estimate. Because of his quieter style and more conciliatory approach, we believe <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would be less inflammatory in domestic policies than <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>; he almost certainly would be less difficult in relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</item>

                            <item>This is not to say that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would set a policy line antithetical to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests, but simply that he bears a bitterness which cannot readily be erased and would not be likely to cooperate more enthusiastically than he thought necessary. For example, a government headed by <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would probably be difficult in dealings with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> matters, but would probably go along with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> position on most global issues considered by the UN. In general, we believe that he would be likely to follow foreign policy lines acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, mainly because of concern that badly-needed <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic aid would not otherwise be continued.</item>

                            <item>As was indicated during his seven months as president in 1963, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> does not have much flair for executive action or administration, nor for finding aides who have such abilities. He is much better at proclaiming a program than implementing it. His tolerance of a variety of views, including those of the extreme left, has caused him trouble before and might again. Moreover, he has continued to show mercurial changes of mood, as well as an obsessive fear for his own safety. His <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0436"/>future actions are not entirely predictable; it is conceivable, for example, that he might win the presidency but later decide to resign if the frustrations of office should become extreme.</item>

                            <item>The revolution and its aftermath have produced sharp new animosities, difficult if not impossible to overcome. We think the broad tendency within the D.R. will be toward continuing growth of the political left. How much of this will benefit the parties of the extreme left and how much the moderate left will, of course, depend on the performance of the new government as well as on the leadership and competitive skill of the parties involved.</item>

Their members have taken the leading role at the university, and obtained a number of positions in the government bureaucracy; they continue to have influence, although they are by no means the strongest force, in the labor union movement. They have, moreover, substantially increased their capability, in terms of weapons, training, experience, and cadres, to carry out urban terrorism or guerrilla warfare in parts of the countryside—although in general the rural population remains unsympathetic.</item>

                            <item>There is a danger that if the moderate left is politically frustrated, some elements may make common cause with the extreme left. In the event that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> were elected and later displaced by the military, this combination on the left would become almost a certainty. In combination, the various leftist parties could bring heavy pressure on any government by means of political strikes, student agitation, and general violence. This might in turn provoke strongly repressive action by the military and finally lead to a new outbreak of civil war, with possible divisions among the military.</item>

                            <item>In any case, the government which comes to power on 1 July will probably have nearly as much opposition as backing. It will be confronted with social, economic and political problems so intractable that any significant accomplishment over the next year or two will be extremely difficult. If it fails to move forward at all in these fields, the support it begins with will shrink away and its vulnerability will increase. Thus the outlook for political stability is discouraging.</item>

Spending for consumption will almost certainly dominate, and no large-scale private investment from either domestic or foreign sources is likely, pending a viable political solution.</item>

                            <item>The new governmentʼs economic focus in 1966 and 1967 will be largely limited to short-run measures to provide immediate benefits to the populace. There will be strong pressure to cut down unemployment and central government spending can be expected to increase considerably. The budget deficit in 1966 is likely to run about $50 million. Increased demand for goods will probably lead to appreciable price rises. If for political reasons the government should undertake greater expansionist spending policies, price increases would be sharper and pressures on the countryʼs balance-of-payments stronger. There probably will be significant deterioration in the Dominican balance of payments position in 1966 and without improved production and prices for sugar the outlook for 1967 remains dim. A rise in imports and the probable stagnation of exports could cause a 1966 deficit for goods and services in the range of $75 to $100 million.</item>

                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> program loans and food supplies, combined with loans from the Inter-American Development Bank and other developmental credit assistance, can meet much of the expected shortfall in Dominican finances and materially help with pressing supply problems. The Dominican government may, nevertheless, have to give serious consideration to devaluation as a means of restoring the balance in international payments. But unless this were done as a part of a carefully worked out stabilization program, there is a good chance that a round of price and wage increases would soon vitiate its benefits.</item>
                            <label>46.</label>
                            <item>In short, Dominican economic policies in 1966 and 1967 will be almost entirely aimed at achieving short-term and largely political results. The government will almost certainly take some tentative steps toward agricultural development, improved education, and more efficient operations of the large state-owned sector of the economy. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and other lending agencies are already supporting projects in these lines. Nevertheless, the economy will remain vulnerable to export price fluctuations and it will face for a long time such problems as an inadequate marketing system, a shortage of capital, backward technology in agriculture, a general lack of technical and managerial skills and a grave problem of government management and resource allocation. Reform measures of the type required for sustained economic development will be extremely difficult without a prolonged period of political stability. Political stability, in turn, will be difficult to attain without a better military relationship to the government and a determined effort by civilian leadership to undertake basic social and economic reform.</item>

                        <p>Neither <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> nor any of his party leaders knows very much about political organization or the conduct of presidential campaigns. This lack of experience combined with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs relative lack of success in raising campaign funds from local sources have thus far impeded full exploitation of latent but widespread pro-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> sentiment. There has been a noticeable improvement in the organization and management of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs campaign [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. An evaluation of the progress to date, however, indicates that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] should be prepared to inject additional funds into the campaign to ensure that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> does not lose momentum at a critical point in the race because of shortage of cash. [<hi rend="italic">5½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>] The purposes of this memorandum are (a) to report on [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] operations undertaken to date on <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs behalf, and (b) to obtain 303 Committee authorization for an additional [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] which could be made available to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> through non-attributable channels if he is unsuccessful in raising necessary funds from other sources as will probably be the case or if he obviously needs additional support for specific campaign purposes.</p>

In an undated proposed agenda for the May 5 meeting McAfee summarized the proposal cited in <ref target="#d172">Document 172</ref> and its status thus far. McAfee also referred to a May 4 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Gordon</persName> to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> in which <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Gordon</persName> stated <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>ʼs approval of the proposal in <ref target="#d172">Document 172</ref> and recommended <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName>ʼs support of it. McAfee stated: “<gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> agrees with the <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> position. We have considered the merits of authorizing only a part of the requested [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] at this time, but do not believe them solid enough to justify modification of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] proposal. We have little doubt the whole [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] would ultimately have to be authorized in any event, and we see no real point in depriving [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] of flexibility in this operation.” In an undated memorandum for the record prepared by McAfee on May 5, he recounts <persName corresp="#p_DGCJ1">Denney</persName> briefing <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName> on the May 5 303 Committee meeting: “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGCJ1">Denney</persName> noted that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] had already been spent and that continued expenditures increased the likelihood of a leak which would reveal U.S. intervention.” McAfee continued, “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGCJ1">Denney</persName> noted that we had queried <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> about previous support for <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> which had apparently been provided at some previous time. Thus <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> might be aware that we could be similarly engaged with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGCJ1">Denney</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs campaign seemed to be gaining momentum and that one such leak might contribute significantly to putting his campaign over.” (All in Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INRIL1">INR/IL</gloss> Historical Files, Dominican Republic 1966)</note>

                        </list>
                        <p>Without consulting Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> or other representatives on the Ad Hoc Committee, <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> dispatched a personal emissary to the various Latin American capitals and Washington (arriving on June 14) to urge a “unanimous meeting of the minds” that the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> be withdrawn from the Dominican Republic before the installation of a constitutional government. This move was probably taken by <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Godoy</persName> with an eye towards the 1970 election (when he could campaign as the man who got the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> out of the Dominican Republic). It would confront the newly-elected President, however, with the choice of requesting the continued presence of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> or automatically foregoing the security it affords and the new government may badly need.</p>
                        <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0442"/>
                        <p>To take the initiative away from <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Godoy</persName>, the State Department has circulated for comment a proposed <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> resolution dealing with the withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>. The State proposal (Tab A), together with the reaction of the Embassy at Santo Domingo, <gloss target="#t_CINCLANT1">CINCLANT</gloss> and the Joint Chiefs, is described below.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">State</hi> proposes an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Resolution that would call for the withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> unless the newly-elected government decides by June 15th that the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> should stay on. The State proposal assumes that the Dominican military and police will be capable of keeping peace and order. It also assumes that the Dominican military will accept <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> (unless he begins to govern ineptly or tries to eliminate the military). It notes the possibility, however, that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> might try to keep the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> for an extended period as an umbrella to protect him while he revamps the Dominican military to his liking and to place him in a better position in dealing with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on economic assistance.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Embassy</hi> argues against the State proposal on the grounds that no Dominican politician could afford the risk of requesting, after the election, that the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> stay on. The Embassy believes that both <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would want the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> to remain for the first few months, and it urges that it is in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interest to assist the new government, no matter who is elected, to get off to a proper start. The Embassy endorses a formula under which a decision on whether the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> stays or goes would be taken by the 10th Meeting of Foreign Ministers, after the election and following consultation among the Ad Hoc Committee, <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> and the successful candidate. This formula, the Embassy believes, would give the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and the newly-elected President the flexibility they both need.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_CINCLANT1">
                                <hi rend="italic">CINCLANT</hi>
                            </gloss> disagrees with State and Santo Domingo. He proposes a resolution calling for the withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> immediately following the elections. <gloss target="#t_CINCLANT1">CINCLANT</gloss> would not give the elected President an option to retain the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>. He argues that the mission of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> will have been fulfilled with the holding of elections and fears that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, if elected, would retain the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> so that he could revamp the Dominican military along leftist lines. Without the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CINCLANT1">CINCLANT</gloss> believes that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> would be forced to seek an accommodation with the military. <gloss target="#t_CINCLANT1">CINCLANT</gloss> challenges Stateʼs assumption re the abilities of the Dominican security forces.<gloss target="#t_CINCLANT1">CINCLANT</gloss> considers that the Dominican forces would be adequate up to a point where military-type action might become involved. If the latter should occur, he feels that at least 20% of the Dominican security forces would defect and that we would be confronted with another April 1965. In <gloss target="#t_CINCLANT1">CINCLANT</gloss>ʼs judgment, the Dominican security forces cannot be fully trained or equipped before January 1967.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Joint Chiefs</hi> favor a variation of the State formula. They propose an early <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Resolution calling for the withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>
                            <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0443"/>
                            <hi rend="italic">to begin</hi> at the earliest practicable date following the election. The speed of withdrawal under this proposal would depend upon the degree of stability shown by the new government. The Joint Chiefs share <gloss target="#t_CINCLANT1">CINCLANT</gloss>ʼs assessment of the ability (or inability) of the Dominican security forces to maintain peace and order. The Chiefʼs position is at Tab B.<note n="2" xml:id="d174fn2">Not attached.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>We agree with the Chiefʼs proposal, but believe it would be improved by adding a statement to the Resolution that the rate of withdrawal would be determined by the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> (through the Ad Hoc Committee) after discussion with the newly-elected government. This addition would avoid the criticism that the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> might be withdrawn precipitately immediately following the elections.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you approve the State Department proposal as modified by the JCS and ISA changes noted above.<note n="3" xml:id="d174fn3">Approved by <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> on May 11.</note> Both changes are shown in Tab A.</p>

                            <p>From the point of view of the security of the United States the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> should remain in the Dominican Republic after a newly elected government is inaugurated only if the Dominican police and military <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0444"/>are unable to maintain internal security and prevent a Communist takeover of the government. As a result of the training and equipment we have provided to the Dominican police and military over the last several months, it is the view of the Departments of State and Defense that these forces are now capable of maintaining internal security in the Dominican Republic. We should, however, continue our stepped-up training program and provide such other equipment as may be considered necessary to keep these forces in an adequate state of readiness.</p>
                            <p>The continued presence of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> in the Dominican Republic provides a lightning rod for extremists and in a sense strengthens their position. It is a continued political liability to the United States.</p>
                            <p>It is recognized that the extreme left in the Dominican Republic has substantial arms in its possession. It is unlikely that these arms will be collected in the near future, certainly not within the time limit which the Hemisphere in general would consider acceptable for the continuance of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> in the Dominican Republic. We must be prepared to accept the risk that the Communists, at one time or another, will make a further play for power in the Dominican Republic. The best method for dealing with this risk is adequate training and equipping of the Dominican police and military establishment. We could not hope to continue an <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> in the Dominican Republic indefinitely for the purpose of dealing with this risk.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> as President</p>
                            <p>The election of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> as President of the Dominican Republic would provide reasonable assurance of a satisfactory working relationship between the civilian government and the Dominican armed forces. It can also be expected that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will take appropriate action to avoid infiltration of his government by Communists and Communist sympathizers. The Communists and extreme left can be expected to agitate against a government headed by <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, but such agitation can be handled so long as <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and the armed forces work harmoniously together and the United States provides a reasonable level of assistance to the government. It is expected that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would request the withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> very soon after his election.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> as President</p>
                            <p>A government headed by <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> will have difficulty maintaining good relations with the Dominican armed forces and police. But the armed forces leaders have made clear that they will accept the election results. Difficulties between <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and the armed forces would arise if he governed as ineptly as he did in 1963, or if he took action which the armed forces interpret as an effort to eliminate them. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has indicated in some of his remarks and through third parties that he <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0445"/>might like to keep the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> in the Dominican Republic after his election as a counterpoise to the Dominican military and police.</p>
                            <p>The possibility exists that we will be asked to remove the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> by the newly elected president at a time of his choosing. In the case of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>, there may be an equivocal situation in which he would seek to keep the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> as a trump card to be used by him against the Dominican armed forces. This contingency could involve the United States and the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> continuously in Dominican politics. Moreover, the recent speeches of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> on economic matters suggest that there may be considerable difficulty in working out a satisfactory self-help program under Alliance criteria. With our continued commitment in the Dominican Republic through the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>, however, we might be forced to provide continuing economic assistance on a basis which we regard as unsatisfactory.</p>
                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> commitment, and therefore ours, is to help restore a normal situation in the Dominican Republic and to carry the country to elections. By extension, it might also be said that this includes inauguration of the elected president. Thus, if the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> remains in the Dominican Republic long enough to assure the installation of a president, we would have fulfilled the objectives we set out to achieve in April 1965.</p>
                            <p>The decision on withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> should be made before the election. If <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> should win and the decision is delayed until after the election, we will be under pressure from certain elements in the United States to keep the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> in the Dominican Republic to assure that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> stays in office. If we nevertheless decide at that stage to withdraw the force, we may be charged with leaving <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> to the mercy of the Dominican military forces.</p>

                            <item>(FYI) Department notes tendency some officials and press in Latin America to assume that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> victory in June 1 elections is foregone conclusion. Our reading of Dominican election indicators show that it is very much of horse race.

There is no basis for suspicion election may be rigged. Dominican Electoral Commission seems impartial and we have detected no reason for serious complaint against it. Election will be conducted under <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> observation as was case in free election of 1962. We also expect substantial number newsmen will be present. U.S. and <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Ad Hoc Committee have encouraged all these efforts assure Dominicans have chance free election and that results will be respected. (End FYI.)</item>

The Embassy concluded that there is no information to backup predictions and that the “political, economic, and social ingredients of campaign are intricate web from which one is well-advised to derive patterns cautiously.” The Embassy reported that the race “should be considered too close to toss-up, with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> probably being right now man to beat.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 14 DOM REP)</note> three trends have altered complexion election campaign, boosting <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs chances but leaving outcome still not clearly predictable: renewed vigor <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0449"/>and confidence <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> campaign; all but formal collapse Bonnellyʼs MIN everywhere except possibly Cibao, with fragments gravitating to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> without conditions; and failure <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> neutralize communism issue or cleanse from <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> taint of involvement in swelling campaign violence.</item>

In improving public relations effort, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has broadcast at different times on two national networks. Since early May has received near maximum exposure through series at least thrice-weekly radio talks, has stepped up campaign tours and is usually received by impressive crowds turned out by local <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> organizations. Small parties allied with <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> also making intensive use of radio, countryʼs key political medium. Great number <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> vehicles working countryside, expensively printed posters and literature, and airborne <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> streamers all attest to <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>ʼs generous financial sources. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs personal appearances throughout Republic (in “saturation” style of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> candidates) psychologically uplifting to backers and impressive to uncommitted voters.

Communism issue appears still of more concern to most of electorate than Trujillismo, though <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> leaders now hitting frequently and forcefully on <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs Trujillo connections (and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has subtly introduced it in several speeches). Bishopsʼ pastoral letter, intended to proclaim churchʼs election neutrality, provided ammunition for some (including priests according to <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>) to spread notion that even church considers <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> unsafe.

                                <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> campaign since last analysis has continued mount in intensity, and appears well-directed and adequately financed. <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> operatives <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0450"/>in interior have stepped up efforts to turn out maximum of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>-inclined city voters and counter <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> head start in rural areas (while some <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> organizers, sensing victory, show signs of complacency). At top of <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, however, in past three weeks campaign has been less than spectacular. Difficult to judge effect on voter confidence of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs refusal to campaign in person or his statements that he does not want presidency, but it could hardly be encouraging to hard-pressed local leaders. Much of his radio time since last analysis spent on <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> program. Though discussion of roads, dams and irrigation projects is needed, subjects inherently lack drama and newsworthiness and allowed public attention to swing to more sensational comments of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and allies. Moreover, while <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in person making specific promises which are appealing to local audiences and to key sectors (though not necessarily sound economically), <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs economic speeches hold out depressing prospect of austerity, sacrifice and hard work on long road to recovery.</item>

He may have planned stake recovery of initiative on major gambit of threatened withdrawal, but his move at this point seems to have had low and possibly even adverse political yield. Withdrawal threat has lost edge with excessive use. Growing public suspicion that <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and sympathizers responsible for much of current campaign violence has undercut credibility of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs protests, weakened <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> stance as meek and persecuted party, and sowed doubt that all of isolated police-military actions against <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> unprovoked. At same time, many Dominicans have latent anti-military stain and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> accusations may have touched this nerve at important juncture.</item>

PLE has all but announced shift to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and other MIN leaders striving to get into <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs camp—with conditions if possible, without them if necessary—before what remains of organization moves en masse without them. Discouraged by long wait, some MIN committees have broken up and <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0451"/>others moribund. Though public has tended overrate MIN strength, drift of MIN backers to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> brings his campaign psychological lift and sudden last-minute swing of group of parties behind <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> if handled adroitly could help reinforce trend to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> by creating impression among politically imperceptive of massive pro-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> mobilization at critical moment in campaign.</item>

                            <item>Last analysis remains valid in concluding that large bloc of silent swing voters may well decide winner. Many of these of course will cast vote not on merits of candidates or issues but in hope of joining winner. Difficult gauge effect recent weeksʼ campaign interplay on uncommitted bloc who may vote issues. Must be supposed, however, that prospect order and stability remains highly persuasive consideration and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs failure to acquit himself on issues of communism and violence have weakened him, notwithstanding his repudiation of 14th June support. For this reason, we believe <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has gained influence, perhaps transitory, in uncommitted bloc.</item>

                            <item>Overall impression from this vantage point is that in past three weeks <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has gained momentum that, if retained, could put him over. <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> still campaigning with strength and confidence, but loss of initiative at top level has slowed what showed signs of becoming accelerating bandwagon. With little more than one week remaining, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> used what he may have considered a bit trump card without successfully regaining campaign initiative or developing new issue. Result is discernible, even though faint, trend toward <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> among visible electorate. <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> is responding with increased expression of confidence and displaying no defeatism that might hasten migration to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, in fact, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> failure to follow hard-hitting line consistently (e.g., his return, after dramatic withdrawal bit, to important but unexciting issues of economic and social reform) is one of current major puzzles of campaign. We are unable decide whether <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, on basis his own judgments (which must be afforded healthy respect) has concluded he has little to fear, or whether he is doing little more than going through minimum motions to acquit his responsibilities to party. At same time, it possible he lying Doggo in preparation for final-week burst of activity. In this regard, some Reformista Party leaders uneasily wondering what dramatic last-minute surprise <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> may have up his sleeve. Leaving aside such speculation, major questions remain whether recent trend toward <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is more apparent than real and whether—assuming importance of appearances—<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will be able <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0452"/>transform it into victory in brief time remaining, where mistake or accidental bad break can heavily damage either side.</item>

Where <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> organization diligent and effective, indications are <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs earlier rural lead has in places been overcome. Similarly, some probes have revealed areas of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> strength in and around cities, including some poorer neighborhoods of Santo Domingo. Sugar areas still lean toward <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, but not monolithically. Among salaried mill workers <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has heavy lead; but among cane cutters and colonos <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has significant strength.</item>

However, in remaining two thirds of country, including populous Cibao, trends at this point hard to establish and prediction would be little more than guess. During recent visits to northwest, Cibao and northeastern provinces, EmbOffs had impression of slight <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> edge, but <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has drawn extremely well in appearances in those areas and very important silent Campesino vote there defies evaluation. In this last regard, caution advisable in assuming silent vote is usually pro-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. In areas in which military, police and patron are dominant influence, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> backers are inclined to keep their peace.</item>

                            <item>Taking into account all above factors and admittedly unscientific soundings by Embassy, at this point in campaign we now conclude very hesitantly that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has become the man to beat, principally because he has apparently gained the initiative, a matter of great importance with respect to influencing the large and decisive uncommitted bloc of voters. Events between now and June 1 may well change picture. As we have seen breaks of the race and invigorated Reformista campaign have closed gap. But as tight, hard fought race heads toward finish, inherent organizational superiority of <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs undeniable color and charisma are still advantages that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has yet to prove he has fully overcome.</item>

                        <p>The results of the June 1, 1966, presidential elections in the Dominican Republic were reported to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> in a June 3 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> who wrote that an “impressive” number of voters, approximately 1.4 million from an estimated 1.7 million, went to the polls. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> summarized that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> had captured 57.09 percent of the vote; <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> 39.17 percent and Bonnelly 3.4 percent.

                        </p>
                        <p>Since April 1965 we have pursued four central objectives in United States policy toward the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">First Objective.</hi> With the outbreak and spread of violence in Santo Domingo in April, 1965, the United States acted to protect the lives of U.S. citizens and to evacuate those wishing to depart. The U.S. also gave protection to and evacuated the nationals of other countries.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Evaluation</hi>. Some 6,500 men, women and children from 46 different countries were evacuated without loss of life.</p>
                            </item>
                            <item>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Second Objective.</hi> With the complete breakdown of all governmental authority, including the rebel Molina Urena regime, and the filling of the power vacuum by extremists dominated by trained Communists, the U.S. acted to prevent the takeover of the Dominican Republic by these extremist groups. In accomplishing this objective it was the policy of the U.S. first, to preserve the opportunity for the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> to function and, second, to work within the framework of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> to permit the Dominican people to exercise self-determination.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Evaluation.</hi> The <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, through collective action approved by the Tenth Meeting of Foreign Ministers, established the first Inter-American Peace Force (approved May 6 and organized May 23) and established, on June 2, the “Ad Hoc Committee for the Restoration of Democratic Order in the Dominican Republic”.</p>
                                <p>The U.S. forces, and subsequently the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> forces, stopped the increasing chaos and bloodshed, primarily by separating contending forces with the “Line of Communication”. This action and the work of the Ad Hoc Committee in helping the Dominicans to establish a provisional government frustrated the efforts of the Communists to seize control of the Dominican Republic by force. (At the same time this objective was being accomplished, the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> did not permit control of the Dominican Republic to fall into the hands of the military or rightist groups.)</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Third Objective.</hi> With the re-establishment of relative stability under Provisional Government, the U.S., within the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> framework, worked to help bring about free and fair elections through which the will of the Dominican people could be expressed.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Evaluation.</hi> On June 1 elections were held and judged by competent <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and private observers to be free and fair. Results now available show <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName> receiving 57.07% and <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> 39.17% of the vote. (Bonnelly received 3.41%.)</p>
                                <p>U.S. intelligence indicated in March 1965 and in the months prior to the June 1966 election that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName> was overwhelmingly the choice of the Dominican people for President. This intelligence plus the decisive results of the election are conclusive evidence that the <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0455"/>timely action of the United States permitted rather than frustrated democratic expression of the will of the Dominican people.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Fourth Objective.</hi> Beginning in the second week of the revolt, the U.S. had as a corollary objective keeping the Dominican economy afloat and preventing widespread hunger and hardship.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Evaluation.</hi> The small sector of Santo Domingo under rebel control represented the financial and commercial heart of the Dominican Republic and included the banks, major governmental offices, and important private commercial institutions. While the revolt caused an economic suspension in the Dominican Republic, the U.S., by helping to organize and finance basic civic services and by enabling the banks to open branches outside the rebel area, prevented the suspension from drifting into economic collapse. Outside of the capital city, there was a minimum disruption of economic patterns.</p>
                                <p>Hunger and extreme hardship were avoided by a large scale feeding and relief program organized by the U.S. within days after the revolt. By utilizing U.S. forces on the Line of Communication as one of the means to distribute food, the U.S. not only increased the rapidity of distribution but also dissipated much of the hostility toward the presence of U.S. troops.</p>
                                <p>During the 13-month period between the revolt and the elections the U.S. distributed directly and through voluntary agencies over $16 million in food (final figures are not available). In other assistance, the U.S. obligated over $118 million (excluding U.S. military expenditures) mostly used to keep the economy and the government sector afloat. About $57 million of this was nominally administered through the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>.</p>

                            <note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">In this June 16 memorandum <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Gordon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> summarized the economic discussions begun on June 7 among <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName>, and President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in Santo Domingo. They informed <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> that a total assistance package of $70 million for FY 1966 and 1967 had been authorized, and an additional $10 to $25 million in supporting assistance may be required from the Contingency Fund in FYߝ1967. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> Files: Lot 68 D 93, Dominican Republic)</note> and <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Ellsworth Bunker</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d179fn3">In this June 16 memorandum entitled “Need for Continuing Supporting Assistance in the Dominican Republic,” <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> seconded the recommendation of <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Gordon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> in their June 16 memorandum for more supporting assistance (see <ref target="#d179fn2">footnote 2</ref> above). <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> also supported a devaluation of the Dominican peso, but warned that such a measure would take coaxing on the part of the Dominicans because they are “generally afraid of devaluation.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> Files: Lot 68 D 93, Dominican Republic)</note> which deal with the probable size of the aid program <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0456"/>needed for next year and with the difficult question of the timing of a devaluation of the Dominican peso. Not having the operational responsibilities of Link and <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Ellsworth</persName>, I should like to offer some views from a different perspective without giving detailed action recommendations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Internal Security</hi>. Central to the question of political stability in the Dominican Republic is the capability of the Dominican police and military to maintain security once the Inter-American Peace Force is withdrawn (presumably within 90 days of the July 1 inauguration). While the decisive election of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has taken some of the steam out of the extreme left, the Communists, after their baptism of fire, are better organized for violence (as opposed to political action) than ever before. They and the “tigres” still have large quantities of arms obtained during the revolt.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore a first order of business to assure that the Dominican security forces are properly equipped, trained and led. As our military forces are being withdrawn, consideration might be given to quietly leaving behind certain equipment, especially soft goods and riot control matériel, which we might find politically difficult to supply to the Dominicans at a later date.<note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4">The President wrote: “Pursue <hi rend="italic">good</hi>” next to this paragraph.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, the Dominican Military must be modernized, professionalized and taken out of politics. The integrity of the military must not be undermined but at the same time, and important to its capability to maintain security, the military must improve its image in the eyes of the Dominican people who aspire to a reduction in both its size and role. It should be dissuaded from seeking vengeance against <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and other antagonists and it should be oriented away from politics and “golpista” tendencies. Over a period of time, the armed forces should be substantially reduced in number, consequently reducing the tremendous drain it represents in the Government budget.<note n="5" xml:id="d179fn5">The President wrote “I agree” next to this paragraph.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Sense of Progress.</hi>” It is important to the maintenance of stability for the Dominican people to have a “sense of progress”. They must feel that there is a year to year improvement in their economic life and believe that their childrenʼs lives will be better than their own. Given the best of circumstances, only relatively meager gains in the Dominican living standard can be achieved in the next few years. Therefore, this psychological “sense of progress” can only be achieved in ways that are in addition to important but long-run economic development objectives. (The long-run objectives which can be realistically achieved in the Dominican Republic are mainly self-sufficiency in food; export <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0457"/>competitiveness in cash crops such as sugar, fresh vegetables and produce; food processing for consumption and export; and tourism.)</p>
                        <p>Even <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs economic orthodoxy probably will not overcome the apprehensions of Dominican and foreign investors to the point where private sector investment will provide the immediate economic push needed. Therefore a sense of progress will depend largely on government attitudes and projects.</p>
                        <p>As a first step, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> should organize his government to reflect the urgency of the economic job to be done. He should name an economic “czar”, responsible only to him and with ample powers to overcome political and bureaucratic obstacles. Julian Perez, the head of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs Economic Commission, may be the right man.</p>
                        <p>As in Mexico, rapid land distribution could be a major element in creating a sense of progress. Large properties held over from the Trujillo days are available and their distribution, with clear titles, should be begun. Some of the past Mexican mistakes should be avoided such as communal ownership, distribution of non-viable parcels and failure to provide for the other elements such as credit, roads, etc., which make agrarian reform meaningful.<note n="6" xml:id="d179fn6">Next to this paragraph the President wrote: “Take up with <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName>. L.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Mission should not be over expanded with “technical assistance” employees. We should operate to a larger extent through contracts with action-oriented organizations on highly visible regional projects. For immediate action we have the Yuma Valley project and in the longer run, there are the World Bankʼs regional projects for the Yaqui Valley.</p>
                        <p>Special emphasis should be given to the use of our resources in technical and vocational education so that Dominicans now filling menial jobs can feel that their children will be able to move a notch higher in the economic and social scale.</p>
                        <p>Finally, in creating a sense of progress it is essential to avoid creating unreasonable expectations, which if frustrated, could contribute to another round of violence.</p>

                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">Hoover</persName> has furnished security reports on 35 of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs first appointments.<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">Not further identified.</note> These cover the Cabinet and sub-Cabinet, the Supreme Court and some of the key independent agencies such as State Properties, Industrial Development, Immigration, Communications and Airport Administration.</p>
                        <p>Security-wise the Cabinet looks good. The report on Minister of Interior and Police Ramon Castillo contains references to past pro-Castro sympathies. He is a rather erratic fellow who is now well right of center and working closely with our Embassy in Santo Domingo.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> made a clean sweep of the Supreme Court. You will recall that under <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> some highly undesirable elements got into the judiciary. The FBI has no derogatory information on the new group. The Attorney General is also given a clean bill. We can expect the new Supreme Court to clean house further down the ranks of the judiciary.</p>
                        <p>The heads of independent agencies, with one exception, present no problems. The Director General of State Properties is said by one source to have been a member of the Communist Party. The charge does not seem to be supported by other sources. Both <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> regard him as honest, trustworthy and a capable administrator.</p>
                        <p>From a security standpoint, the appointments represent quite an improvement from <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs choices ten months ago which had us so worried.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is facing a particularly difficult dilemma. He feels the need to bring his military more under control; he would like to do this before the departure of the Inter-American Peace Force (<gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>), now scheduled for late September; but to do it so quickly risks a violent reaction by the military. One possible way out would be to ask the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> to stay longer, though this too would have some political cost.</p>

Some elements on the extreme left have resumed acts of violence; some on the extreme right are plotting once again. One aspect of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs response has been the preparation of a draft law to curtail political party activity; this is antagonizing part of the moderate opposition as well. His own Reformist Party is not so well-organized or united that it provides him with a really solid base, and a number of its members are disenchanted because <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has given them less patronage and more austerity than they expected.</item>

Total number of military personnel is nearly 19,000. In addition, there is the National Police with about 8,500. Though not the throw-back, guerrilla outfit it was in Trujilloʼs time, the Dominican military is still essentially a conservative force and tends to align itself with the civilian elite.

He has appointed as his own military <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0460"/>aide an ambitious officer who is generally considered a Trujilloist and is regarded with suspicion by the defense minister and the service chiefs, who have made their views known to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has replaced the chief of police with a trusted associate—but a man who seems heavier handed and lighter headed than his predecessor.

                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has told the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Ambassador that he is determined to proceed with a reduction and thorough reorganization of the Dominican military. Although he realizes that this involves some risk, he may be underestimating how much. He has emphasized his belief that certain specific changes must be accomplished and that the broad outline of the whole plan must be established while he still has the backing of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>. (<gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> strength is now down to about 5,000, and the last units are scheduled to leave in the latter part of September.) He has been giving some thought to the pros and cons of requesting an extension of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> presence.</item>

                            <item>Many Dominican military figures are probably willing to cooperate with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in his reorganization efforts. Others in the military are bound to become restive as they see plans developed to cut back not only their numbers, but also their privileges and prerogatives. Officers already involved in conspiring with civilian rightists are likely to do more of it. Any upsurge in terrorism on the part of the extreme left or any improvement in the political fortunes of the moderate left, would probably cause more of the military to involve themselves in coup plotting.</item>

The likelihood of these contingencies will in any case become greater when the last elements of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> depart. And if, before the presently scheduled departure date in late September, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> presses ahead to accomplish several of his military reform measures—and to advertise the rest—the chances of a military coup would be sharply increased.</item>

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>The withdrawal of the Inter-American Peace Force (<gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>) in late September will remove the primary element that has ensured Dominican stability during the past 16 months. Although there is presently no evidence that the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> ʼs departure in itself will serve as the immediate trigger for a coup or insurgency, the chances for a confrontation between <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and dissatisfied elements are likely to increase appreciably over the ensuing months.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has not developed a political base strong enough to withstand severe reactions to his reforms, particularly those affecting right-wing military elements. He will have to balance carefully the opposing political forces if he is to implement his program without the backing of something like the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>. If the President succeeds in implementing those reforms through which he seeks to curb the power of right-wing military elements prior to the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> ʼs departure—and then can make them stick—his chances for retaining power will be improved. It is by no means certain, however, that he can successfully negotiate this Dominican tightrope.</p>

                            <item>During the period September 6ߝ8, I had an opportunity to review the situation in the Dominican Republic with President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, ex-President <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> and Professor <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> as well as with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName>, the United States <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> officials, Generals Braga and Linvill of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>, and Dominican civilians.</item>

                            <item>I have come away with the impression that despite a situation which presented many difficulties of a political, economic and social nature, the new administration of President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has made commendable progress. Political compromises, not always desirable, had to be made in an effort to overcome and heal old hatreds and bring into the Government as wide a spectrum as possible. Strenuous efforts had to be made to set in motion a stagnant economy. While austerity measures had to be applied to the economic situation, at the same time account had to be taken of the dangerous and explosive situation arising from widespread unemployment, and measures to increase job opportunities had to be planned and implemented. The loyalty and cooperation of the Armed Forces, historically a question mark in the Dominican political situation, had to be secured.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>I believe the new Administration has made considerable progress in working toward the solution of these difficult and complex problems. Despite a few initial missteps and an early tendency on the part of the Reformista congressional majority to ride roughshod over the opposition, President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has made serious efforts to obtain the cooperation of Professor <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>. Professor <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> for his part has expressed his personal friendliness for President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and has endeavored to carry out his role and that of his party as a constructive opposition. I mentioned to both President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and Professor <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> that it seemed to me essential, if the country were to pull through the difficult situation it faced, that both the leaders and their <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0463"/>parties should endeavor to cooperate and work together. Both expressed themselves as being in full agreement.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>On the economic side President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is holding weekly meetings with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName>, top members of our <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> staff and Dominican officials concerned with economic problems. Both President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> stated that they felt very satisfactory progress was being made in implementing the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs. The Government is also beginning to grapple with the difficult problem of reorganization of the Sugar Corporation. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> wished me to express to you his very deep appreciation for the allocation to the Dominican Republic of additional sugar quota and for the support and assistance he had received. While other problems have been encountered, as, for example, the present depressed tobacco market and some additional unemployment brought about by austerity measures, on the part of the business community there appears to be increasing confidence in the ability of the Government to survive the present difficulties.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>In response to my question about the attitude of the Armed Forces, President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> replied that he considered that his relations with the Minister of the Armed Forces, the Chiefs of Staff and other leaders were excellent, that he held weekly luncheon meetings with them, that they accepted the fact that the military establishment was in need of reorganization, including a reduction in numbers. He has already taken steps to reduce its size by attrition and begun to dismantle the power base of a troublesome group at the San Isidro air base near Santo Domingo. He said that in some elements, particularly in the Air Force, changes would have to be made but that in general he was well satisfied that a proper relationship existed between the Government and the Armed Forces. He also expressed himself as pleased by the plans for reorganization submitted by the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and proposed to go ahead with them although they would have to be put into effect gradually.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>I reminded the President that as of September 1 there were 2700 troops of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> in the Dominican Republic and that according to the present schedule the last contingent would leave on September 20. The President replied that this schedule was entirely satisfactory to him but then inquired whether it would be possible to retain, for psychological purposes, a small group until the end of September or perhaps even for a week or two in October without any formal request from him. I replied that while this might be possible any substantial extension would require a new resolution by the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> following a formal request from him. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> stated categorically that he did not wish to make such a request and my own view is that little is to be gained by an extension of the kind he has suggested; and that on the other hand perhaps a good deal of criticism of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>, and especially <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0464"/>the U.S. might result. Both General Braga and General Linvill feel that an extension such as suggested by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would be unwise.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> expressed considerable optimism over the results of the Governmentʼs efforts during the first two months in office. In spite of some initial errors he felt that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was gaining experience and confidence and that there was a widespread feeling in the country that this administration must be kept in power for its full four year term. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>, who expects to arrive in Washington September 18 as the Dominican Ambassador, has been performing a very useful role in an advisory capacity to both President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and Professor <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and as intermediary with them.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>The one exception to the generally favorable view which I received was that of Professor <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>. While he reiterated his determination to work with President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, for whom he expressed personal friendship, he said that plotting was continuing and that the only way to put an end to it was to “dismantle the terrorist apparatus” led mainly by extreme right-wing civilians. He added that General <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> was always the center of these plots but that if the eight or ten leaders were given overseas diplomatic assignments the backbone of the plotting would be broken and <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> would quiet down. Professor <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> said that he felt his own presence in the Dominican Republic was vital since he was in a position to exercise restraint on the masses. He expressed great concern over the economic and social problems that beset the country and felt that President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> should exercise care in applying his austerity program not to aggravate further the unemployment problem. He estimated that there were between 80 or 90 thousand unemployed in Santo Domingo alone.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>With the exception of Professor <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, I could find no one who felt that there were signs of any widespread plotting or any likelihood that efforts would be made to overthrow the government. While some irreconcilable elements of the extreme Left and Right stand ready to oppose President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, these have no significant popular following. While they still possess a significant quantity of arms, considerable progress has been made in collecting heavy weapons and President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is of the opinion that considerably more progress will be made in this respect. I believe that the Dominican military is loyal to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and is capable of putting down any uprising that might be foreseeable in present circumstances. The major opposition parties, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and the Social Christian <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>, in assuming the role of constructive opposition give the government their support. I came away, therefore, with a feeling that very considerable progress had been made, that the country was calmer than I had ever seen it and that President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was acting with determination and a good deal of courage in tackling the many difficult problems with which he is faced.</item>

I informed Mr. <persName>Williams</persName> that while rumors were always circulating in the Dominican Republic, I knew of no serious or significant plotting against the Government; that I expected to investigate these reports when I was in Santo Domingo; and that I should be glad to inform Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> of my views when he returned next week to Washington.

                            <item>The Dominican Republic lacks many of the basic ingredients for stability. It has had scarcely any experience in achieving political compromise through representative institutions. The military—or major groups within it—have long acted as the arbiters of Dominican politics and have not hesitated to intervene when they thought necessary. The 1965 revolution and its aftermath produced sharp new animosities among politically active elements of the population—animosities which cannot be readily overcome. The scope of economic and social problems is such that, at best, progress can come only slowly.<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">These basic considerations are treated in some detail in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 86.2–66, “Prospects for Stability in the Dominican Republic,” dated 28 April 1966.

                            <item>The <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> Administration, in office for less than three months, is only beginning to come to grips with the most serious of its problems. The mandate he received in the June elections—some 57 percent of the vote—helped create a honeymoon period for his Administration, and he moved quickly to establish a strong degree of control over the bureaucracy and to dominate the Congress. However, a large proportion of his Reformist partyʼs adherents are in the rural areas and are politically inactive most of the time; partly for this reason he has been unable to establish a solid, well-organized political base, especially in Santo Domingo. A number of members of his party have become disenchanted because he has not provided patronage on the scale they expected.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Though <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has appointed some members of other parties to cabinet and other administrative posts, this has not attracted much additional political support or otherwise added to the strength of his position. Even by Dominican standards, the calibre of cabinet personnel seems mediocre; <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> himself has little confidence in the competence of certain of the ministers and delegates little authority to them. In some cases he has chosen men for key posts chiefly because he felt sure of their loyalty. This appears to be the case for his chief of police and his military aide. The formerʼs heavy-handedness in dealing with demonstrations or agitation carries the risk of estranging <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> from the moderate left. His military aide is persona non grata with the military chiefs who have long distrusted him and fear he is undercutting them.</item>

                            <item>The Administration has undertaken a few positive economic actions, some popular, some not. It has slightly reduced prices of some foods, it has reduced salaries of higher paid government officials (including military officers), and it has laid off a few government employees. On the other hand, it has not put through any major new tax measures and, though there is a sizable amount of aid money available, has made only limited progress in its emergency investment program. Such projects as are underway have had only marginal impact on the severe unemployment problem, and the government plans in the near future to fire a fairly large number of sugar workers so as to help reduce the exorbitant costs of the government-run sugar establishment.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Among <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs strengths are his centrist political position, his staunch anticommunism, and his reputation for integrity. Another major asset is the general recognition that he has strong <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support—as indicated by the $40 million <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid program for emergency investment and the recent increase in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> quota for sugar from the Dominican Republic. And perhaps the chief factor in his favor is that there is at present no viable alternative.</item>

                            <item>The various political opponents of the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> government have so far acted with relative restraint. Elements of the extreme left and extreme right have perpetrated occasional incidents of terrorism and violence, but this has not been on a major scale. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> and his left-of-center Dominican Revolutionary party have not gone so far as to cooperate with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> but have shown a measure of responsibility in their opposition.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The most important factor affecting the governmentʼs stability will be <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs relationship with the military. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has calculated that his own hold on power cannot become firm unless and until he can establish his governmentʼs authority over the military. To this end, he has made plans for ambitious military reforms aimed at consolidating his control and curbing the power of certain rightwing officers. No Dominican leader since Trujillo has been able to impose his will on the military; those who have taken even tentative steps to do so, as did <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> in early 1965, soon find themselves on delicate ground.</item>

                            <item>
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> realizes that this is a risky business—as shown by his desire to have key reforms accomplished before the departure of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss>. Resentment of the activities of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs military aide and suspicion that the President may eventually replace a number of top officers have contributed to some discontent in the military. A few officers of the far right and civilians of similar view are taking soundings concerning <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs military support, but they do not now seem to have the strength for a successful coup.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs orders issued in late August, which would break up the fourth brigade formerly commanded by General Wessin y Wessin and which would shift air force ground combat troops to the army, have been only partially implemented. One danger point in the near future may come in connection with dispersing the armored battalion of the fourth brigade to different commands; the military are well aware that this would be the most potent single organization for, or against, a coup effort.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>Many of the Dominican military, perhaps a majority, are sympathetic to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs reform plans. But a growing number of officers are likely to become restive as they see the government moving to cut back not only their numbers and prerogatives, but also their power. In making new appointments of military officers he trusts, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will inevitably earn the enmity of those he replaces; this will be particularly so if he turns to certain Trujilloist officers with whom he has associated in the past but who are now regarded with disfavor by most of the younger military men.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>The departure of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> will remove what has served as a primary deterrent to a coup in which the military would be the decisive element. However, the coup danger may not be immediate; it will <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0468"/>depend on how dangerous to the country or to their own interests the military consider <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs actions to be, and to some extent on their ability to find civilian allies. During the period of this estimate, we think that the chief risk of a coup would occur if the military came to feel that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was pushing military changes too far or too fast. There will probably be some increase in terrorist activities by rightist elements, but in themselves these are unlikely to threaten the stability of the regime.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>The withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> will probably also be followed by an increase, though perhaps not a major one, in the terrorist activities of the extreme left. The 14th of June Movement is likely to play the lead role, and some members of the orthodox Communist party will almost certainly be involved. The pro-Chinese Dominican Popular Movement, militant on a number of past occasions, is so badly split that its effectiveness will be limited for some time. The combined assets of these three extreme leftist organizations are not large; the Dominican military will be able to contain and probably eliminate any guerrilla actions they may attempt in the countryside, because the peasants will not give the leftists much support. These groups do have the capability, however, to undertake violent and disruptive operations in Santo Domingo; unless they obtain support from the non-Communist left, they do not pose a serious threat to the government. There is a danger that the police or military, by over-reacting to agitation or demonstrations which they presume to be Communist directed, may create martyrs and drive some erstwhile moderate leftists into common cause with the extremists.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>Faced with these manifold problems, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will not achieve a strong or stable position during the period of this estimate. Moreover, it is unlikely that he can accomplish enough in the way of economic improvement to make any net gain in his political support. On the contrary, some of the economic measures he finds it necessary to take for budgetary or balance of payments purposes are likely to contribute to a gradual erosion of his support. We think, however, the chances are somewhat better than even that he will survive in office for the six month period of this estimate.</item>

                            <item>Together with my colleagues of the Ad Hoc Committee I called on President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> October 25. The Committee wished to ascertain President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs views regarding the continuation in being of the Tenth Meeting of Foreign Ministers. I pointed out to the President that, if the 10th <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss> were to continue in being, the Ad Hoc Committee could also continue in existence and should any situation arise requiring action by the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, the Committee would be able to respond immediately without the time consuming steps involved in convoking another Meeting and establishing new machinery. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> replied that his preference very definitely was to have the 10th <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss> and the Ad Hoc Committee continue in being. He expressed confidence that continuation of the Meeting would raise no public opinion problem within the country. I concur in Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs views regarding the desirability of continuing the Tenth Meeting of Foreign Ministers.</item>

                            <item>I referred to Professor <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs recent allegations of continued terrorism and his complaint that political activity was not possible, that the government was not paying attention to public opinion, and that <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> sponsored bills had not been approved by the Legislature. I added that his present more critical attitude, his decision to retire as head of the Party and his announced departure in early November for Spain contrasted with his avowed intention when I saw him in September<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">See <ref target="#d183">Document 183</ref>.</note> to cooperate with the government.</item>

                            <item>Regarding allegations of terrorism, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> had spoken only in generalities and he had asked him publicly to what specific actions he had reference. He remarked that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>
                                <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0470"/>seems to be tired and dispirited, apparently unhappy and irritated by the situation within the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, with the Party divided and various factions fighting each other. The President added that, although there are responsible men in the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, there does not appear to be any one person likely to replace <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> able to weld the groups together and maintain Party unity.</item>

                            <item>President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> referred to the desirability of completing arrangements as soon as possible for the training of the frogmen in the U.S., a commitment which we had made as early as last January. I informed him that I expected plans to be completed by the end of the present week and that arrangements could be made for their departure promptly. The President expressed the view that departure of the frogmen would remove the remaining source of possible serious friction. He expects no further problem in completing the reintegration of the remaining Constitutionalist forces.</item>

                            <item>The President expressed the view that although the state of the economy represents the biggest problem facing the government the situation has improved. Current expenses are being met out of income and salaries of all employees of the government and government owned enterprises are being paid on time. Special U.S. budget support assistance has not been needed since July. Referring to the Sugar Corporation, he mentioned that the $12 million loan under negotiation with private banks would cover the $6 million current deficit and provide funds for the coming crop. The main problems are to reduce production costs and provide employment for the nearly 5,000 employees whom it was necessary to lay off. He assured me that plans for the use of the $40 million U.S. assistance loan are proceeding well with nearly $9 million committed and $17 million more about to be committed.</item>

Labor opposition is beginning to develop, and there seems to be a growing feeling of pessimism among the part of the business community most affected by the austerity program, particularly importers. There is a situation for potential trouble between the contending stevedore unions, a problem which had presumably been settled by the Provisional Government. It remains to be seen whether the Presidentʼs handling of the situation will be successful.</item>

                            <item>I believe that on balance the constructive factors making for stability of the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> Administration outweigh the negative ones. It was to be expected that there would be some psychological letdown from the atmosphere of anticipation and enthusiasm engendered by the installation of the newly elected Constitutional government. In view of the serious deterioration of the economy aggravated by the <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0472"/>revolution and the continuous series of crises faced by the Provisional Government, the remedial measures undertaken by the new Administration were bound to cause some dissatisfaction. Certain other problems are those being encountered by all of the underdeveloped nations. While one has to take these into account, I am cautiously optimistic about the situation in the Dominican Republic.</item>

                        <p>According to <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> the polarization crisis is less acute than appears in his cables. I agree—but the problem is present, and it is easier to deal with now than later.</p>

                        <p>State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> have worked up a so-so paper on short term courses of action (Tab C) to arrest the polarization trend. On the <hi rend="italic">attitude</hi> side it is fine. In terms of what <hi rend="italic">concrete steps</hi> we can take, it is not too good. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> tells me that they have some ideas that have not been put on paper. We should get these on the table.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">economic reporting</hi> from the Embassy has not been full and sharp. Washington doesnʼt have a clear picture of the present situation and trends. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> is up here for this purpose. We need to pump him.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> said that he had returned over the weekend from the Dominican Republic. On this trip he had found a noticeable improvement in the political and economic climate in his country. There was, he said, a new sense of confidence and forward movement, particularly noticeable in the business community. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> went on to say that the main purpose of his wishing to see the President was to request special consideration in the allocation of sugar deficits. He noted that the Dominican Republic faced three principal economic problems:

                        <p>The Ambassador called at his initiative. He said that he had tried to make an appointment with Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Gordon</persName> yesterday, but given Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Gordon</persName>ʼs imminent departure for Buenos Aires, this was not possible.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the purpose of his visit was to reiterate what he had said to the President in their interview of January 23,<note n="2" xml:id="d189fn2">See <ref target="#d188">Document 188</ref>.</note> 1967 concerning his governmentʼs desire to have an assured quota of 600,000 tons of sugar for the next two or three years while the government-owned sugar corporation was completely modernized. He was making this request again because he had recently heard from his governmentʼs sugar brokers in New York that the Philippines would not be able to meet their share of the Puerto Rican deficit.</p>
                        <p>On the modernization of the sugar industry, the Ambassador reported that his government on February 6 invited bids for a management survey of the industry. The bidding would close on March 6, at which time the government would select a consultant firm to do the survey.</p>
                        <p>I told him that we were also aware of the information in the hands of the sugar trade. I pointed out I was in no position to give him an answer on his request for additional sugar up to 600,000 tons. He said he recognized this. I said that assuming the Philippines would not be able to meet its share of the Puerto Rican deficit, we would not be dealing with the quota redistribution until late spring and probably not until July. I stressed the importance of moving forward with all speed on the modernization of the industry.</p>
                        <p>I told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> that when I saw Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Gordon</persName> in Buenos Aires next week, I would convey his views to him.</p>

                        <p>During a 29 November 1966 White House meeting chaired by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>, a program of short-term courses of action for the Dominican Republic was agreed upon.<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">See <ref target="#d187">Document 187</ref> for a briefing memorandum for the meeting.</note> One of the objectives in this program is the encouragement of moderates within the Revolutionary Social Christian Party (<gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>) and weakening the influence of hard-liners and Communist infiltrators within the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>.

                                </p>
                                <p>The proposal is based on policy stated in a paper entitled “Short-Term Courses of Action for the Dominican Republic” which was approved on 29 November 1966 by representatives from the White House, Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency. To encourage <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> moderates and to diminish influence of hardliners and any Communist infiltration of the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> is one of the objectives cited in the paper. In this context a strong, more moderate Social Christian Student group in the UASD would also tend to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> faction which represents a more responsible leadership.</p>
                                <p>In the University elections of 1966 <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> lost to the Communist student association which now controls the university by a vote of 1182 to 1587 out of a total of 3000 votes cast.<gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> will again present candidates for election during the student government elections scheduled for May 1967. It is the only significant non-communist student association at the University with a fair chance of winning the election. Thus, should <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> win the coming student elections, or at least make a strong showing under a continuing relationship with moderate <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> leader Caonabo Javier Castillo, Communist control of the student government as a vehicle for Communist propaganda would be circumscribed and the turbulent political climate at the University would be ameliorated.</p>
                                <p>The University elections, however, will also play an important part in off-campus politics on a national scale, where student groups enjoy disproportionate importance as pressure groups. Therefore, inasmuch as the <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> candidates being put forward for election are closely identified with the leadership of the moderate wing of the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>, a strong <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> position in the student government of the UASD could substantially strengthen the moderates within the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>, and thus become a moderating influence on the Dominican political scene.</p>
                                <p>The <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> is a left of center political party in opposition to the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> Administration. Although the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> has generally followed a radical line since the April 1965 Revolution, often tactically allied with the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> (Revolutionary Dominican Party) and a coalition of extreme leftist parties, in recent weeks the Javier leadership of the party has declared itself in “constructive opposition” to the Government. This posture of “constructive opposition” was formulated by Caonabo Javier <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0481"/>Castillo, the Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>, who is also influential among Dominican youth. Because of his prestige among youth and students, Javierʼs call for “constructive opposition” has been taken up by <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss>, a Social Christian Student Association, which reflects the line of the Javier faction of the Party. Thus, by helping <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss>, it is hoped that a first step will have been taken towards bringing about a more constructive climate in the university which would at the same time strengthen the more moderate wing of the Party. In this connection, it is well to recall that the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> is the only significant left-of-center party which has made its policy of peaceful opposition a matter of public record.</p>
                                <p>Although Javier now represents the moderate wing of the party, it must be noted that he is also young (age 31), mercurial, and has become in the past identified as a strong critic of so-called U.S. Imperialism in Latin America. It is possible, that Javierʼs recent conversion to a more conciliatory position vis-à-vis the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> Government may be only of a tactical and temporary nature. It should also be noted that even if Javier maintains a party line of loyal opposition to the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> Government, he may in the international field continue to attack the U.S. and so-called “U.S. Imperialism” in Latin America. However, even were Javier to retrogress to a hard anti-U.S. position, a strong <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> position in the University would be preferable to Communist domination of the student federation at the university. Under any circumstances, development of access to the moderate leadership of the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> could constitute an essential instrument in moderating the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> line whichever way Javier might veer in the future.</p>
                                <p>In short, channeling support to a moderate leader of <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> directly or through a leader of the moderate Javier faction of the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>, would be a secure and inexpensive means of implementing the recommendations of the above-cited 29 November 1966 paper on Short-Term Courses of Action for the Dominican Republic.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>Political tensions are on the rise in Santo Domingo and the situation is sufficiently fragile in the Dominican Republic that the regimeʼ stability could be threatened with little warning. There are no signs at present, however, that anti-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> elements plan to move during the Presidentʼ attendance at the hemisphere summit conference in Uruguay next week.<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> was 1 of 20 Chiefs of State who attended the American Chiefs of State Conference at Punta Del Este, Uruguay, April 12–14.</note> There are, however, deep tensions in the country that are certain to cause <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> serious trouble in the near future.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ scheduled journey to the summit conference next week in Punta del Este comes at a time when Dominican political tensions are on the rise. The attempted assassination of <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Antonio Imbert</persName> on 21 March and its aftermath have added new dimensions to the divisive issue of “trujilloism” that could disrupt the regimeʼ fragile political stability.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">The Aftermath of the <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> Affair</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The attack on <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>, one of Trujilloʼ assassins, followed a series of charges—some of them well founded—that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was employing “trujillista” personnel and tactics in his government. The Communist and non-Communist left have made such accusations the focal point of their criticism since last fall. Recently, elements of the anti-Trujillo right—the political aggregation that governed the country during the 1962 Council of State and during the <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> administration that preceded the 1965 revolt—have picked up the theme. Thus, the attack on <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> produced expressions of distress, consternation, and outrage from these elements; moreover suspicions immediately developed that the assailants were in or sheltered by the government.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> moved quickly to forestall immediate serious antigovernment repercussions from the incident. He announced that a special, high-level commission would investigate the assault, established a <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0485"/>$25,000 reward for information on the would-be assassins, and voiced his personal repudiation of the attack. His most dramatic step, however, was the appointment of the other surviving assassin of Trujillo, Luis Amiama Tio, to the sensitive post of minister of interior and police. Amiama, who saw in the attack a danger to his own personal security, agreed to take the post on condition that he be given a free hand to conduct the investigation.</p>
                        <p>4. Although the appointment at least temporarily silenced criticism of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> from most quarters, it planted the seeds of discord within the government. Amiama, who is not identified with the more extreme and intractable right, had become increasingly disenchanted with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> over the last few months. He has privately voiced concern over the Presidentʼ methods and tactics, which he finds reminiscent of those of the late dictator, and has demonstrated a deep sensitivity over the presence in the government of some unsavory leftovers from the Trujillo era. In particular, he has singled out <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ coterie of palace aides for criticism. At the top of Amiamaʼ “bad guy” list is controversial presidential aide Colonel Nivar, but close behind are “special intelligence adviser” Perez–Sosa and legal adviser Polibio Diaz. The background of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ personal bodyguard and adviser, Melido Marte, suggests why Amiama and others are upset. In 1961 Marte was described as “a poorly educated strong-arm thug who is trusted by the Trujillo family.” Although <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> occasionally has voiced dissatisfaction over the often independent conduct of such aides as these, he apparently regards such long-time supporters as completely loyal to him and is reluctant to sever ties with them.</p>
                        <p>5. In accepting the cabinet post, Amiama said he would work for the elimination or downgrading of “trujillista” officials. He quickly came into conflict with one enemy, police chief Tejeda, whom he accused of “unjustifiable errors” in the investigation of the <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> shooting and in effect pressed <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to dismiss him. The replacement, General Soto, however, was once police chief under Trujillo, is considered incompetent and dishonest, and has had close ties with those officials Amiama finds so objectionable. It may well be that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> named Soto to balance Amiamaʼ influence. In any event, Amiamaʼ handling of the investigation and the direct control he would like to exercise over the police seems likely to bring him into conflict with Soto, who has already said he is unaware of any police deficiencies in the <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> case.</p>
                        <p>6. The new minister of interior and police has already come into conflict with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> over the disposition of outgoing police chief Tejeda. Amiama has threatened to resign unless <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, who had named Tejeda to his palace staff, removes the ex-police chief from active duty. If Amiama resigns, this might be followed by the resignation of his brother—Foreign Affairs Minister Fernando Amiama Tio (who <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0486"/>is slated to be a member of the Dominican summit delegation)—and be accompanied by a great glare of publicity and bitter recriminations. Some weeks before the attack on <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>, Amiama threatened that if <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> forced an open break with him he would have no alternative but to make common cause with other anti-“trujillista” elements of both the left and right—including the left-of-center Dominican Revolutionary Party (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>) and the Communists. In fact, Amiama already has held a series of meetings with the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> secretary general over the past two months.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> himself may pose additional political problems as he recovers from his wounds. Even more rightist and opportunistic than Amiama, he had been sounding out various political elements with regard to an anti-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> coalition when the assassination attempt boosted his popular image. <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs heroics after the attack—such as the driving of his own car to the hospital while wounded in both shoulders—probably elicited admiration in certain circles, including the military. Amiamaʼ concern over <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs ambitions may have been behind his suggestion to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Embassy that <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> be invited to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> for medical treatment. Such a move would remove one irritant from the scene, at least for a while.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Attitudes Among the Military</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>8. The attack and resulting investigation has introduced an element of strain into <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ relations with the military. Minister of Defense Perez has said that the intense investigation Amiama has conducted within the armed services has produced some resentment among military officers who remain jealous of their prerogatives and privileges. This could provide an opening for disgruntled military officers, such as those whose political cliques have been disrupted by <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> or who had been removed from choice assignments, to coalesce under the guise of protecting the military establishment. Another factor for instability would develop if military elements came to believe that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ performance in a period of political turmoil showed irresolution and vacillation.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Other Political Factors</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>9. These various charges and maneuvers on the issue of trujilloism are taking place against a mixed pattern of other developments, some favorable and some adverse for the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> government. On the one hand, the left-of-center political parties—particularly those on the extreme left—are in serious disagreement and disarray. On the other hand, they have been keeping up a drumfire of criticism of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> for the failure of his government to control and prevent violence. Particularly active in this role are the radical leaders of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> who succeeded <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> when he went into voluntary exile in Europe. <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0487"/>Government officials continue to provide the left with new ammunition for their charges; most recently the governmentʼ director of telecommunications was accused of armed assault for entering a <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>-oriented radio station on 29 March and destroying transmitting equipment.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has had considerable success in reducing the influence of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and of the extreme leftist parties in the labor movement. There is strong labor resentment, however, over the governmentʼ wage freezes. The Dominican President has managed to wean some moderates away from the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, and so far the small Revolutionary Social Christian Party has adhered to a policy of “constructive opposition.” On the other hand, the Social Christians have recently suggested they would abandon that policy unless <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> allows their party a more influential role, and the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> has said it will not support the government in the event of a coup.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>11. Economic developments have not helped to offset <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ political problems. In fact, available signs indicate that the pace of economic activity has been disappointing thus far this year. This sluggishness has taken place against a background of high and chronic unemployment, and potentially explosive social conditions, particularly in Santo Domingo. Further, the persistent balance of payments deficit has recently shown signs of getting worse and the inflation potential may be growing because of the current trend toward increased government deficits. These economic problems will require politically difficult policy choices involving further import restrictions, higher taxes, and devaluation. Uncertainties over the economyʼ short-term future compound the problem of choosing among these alternatives.</p>

                        <p>12. All things considered, the difficulties facing <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> seem serious but not yet critical. There are no indications that antigovernment elements are planning to take advantage of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ expected absence during the summit meeting, but there are deep currents of tension and emotion within the government that could suddenly surface without warning. In addition, Vice President Lora is neither widely respected nor considered to possess great political acumen, and someone could try to test his control of the situation.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> probably believes that he can reap domestic political dividends from the summit trip in the form of favorable publicity; he may hope to establish an image as a recognized hemisphere statesman. He is likely to seek assurances of continued <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic and political backing—a factor that carries considerable weight with many potential Dominican dissidents.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> replied to a question from the Secretary saying that his country was gradually recovering from its civil war and was strengthening its democratic institutions; the people have learned their lesson from history. Unfortunately, however, they now insist more on their rights than on their obligations. He expressed some concern about the effect of continuous Haitian migration to his country, which adversely affects the Dominican economy and brings in some people with extreme leftist ideas.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to define the number one problem in the Dominican Republic. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> replied that it was unemployment. Even though the present Emergency Plan of forty million dollars and government-generated public works projects were helping relieve the unemployment situation, it was still serious. A possible solution, of course, would be an agrarian reform on a broad scale, since 70 percent of Dominicans are farmers. He stated that a plan is being worked out to re-settle some 20,000 families per year over a five-year period. This program will cost some ten million dollars.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether there were land holdings that could be divided up. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> replied that many of the old Trujillo latifundia are in fact being sub-divided and permanent title is being given to the new owners.</p>
                        <p>On the sugar question, the Secretary pointed out the statutory difficulties involved in changing U.S. quotas, as well as the possible disadvantage of setting a fixed quota and then experiencing a shortage <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0489"/>requiring even larger amounts of imported sugar. The Secretary also mentioned the repercussions of a new Cuban sugar quota if peace is ever reached with that country. He indicated that certain countries such as Morocco had barter arrangements with sugar-producing countries and that it might be possible for the Dominican Republic to enter into such an arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> stated that he was aware of these factors. Japan has recently offered to enter into such a barter arrangement but this offer was not fully satisfactory in that Japan was willing to compute the value of Dominican sugar only at current world prices, which the Dominican Republic thinks are unrealistic.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> congratulated President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> on his ability to lead the Dominican Republic along the road of political and economic <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0490"/>recovery and expressed warm support for the continued growth of constitutional, representative democracy. He stated that the Dominican Republic is a good example of what the United States wishes to see in other parts of the world: namely, that people have the right to self-determination, to freely elect their leaders and to choose the type of government they desire. President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, with the assistance of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> (who is now trying to achieve the same objective in Vietnam), worked together successfully toward that aim.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> thanked the President for his support and indicated that he was constantly working to strengthen his countryʼ economy and its democratic institutions.</p>
                        <p>The President asked him what groups cause him the greatest difficulties. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> replied that the extreme right and the extreme left were the most troublesome groups, although their numbers were very limited. The majority of the Dominican people want peace and stability and support their present Government.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that because of the prominence of the Dominican people in the eyes of the Hemisphere and of the world he hoped that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would have a chance to tell his Latin American colleagues of the efforts by the United States to keep Castroite extremists and others from taking over the Dominican Republic and how the Dominican Republic and the United States had worked together to insure free and honest elections there. It would be good to tell some of the more skeptical Presidents how the Dominican people decided not to be swallowed up by communism and it would be helpful for them to hear from an especially authoritative source that the United States is not interested in satellites or in territorial gains—as proved when the United States left the Dominican Republic right after last yearʼ Presidential elections. The President said that some of our best young men had given their lives in the Dominican Republic and that hundreds of millions of dollars had been spent there for the sole purpose of guaranteeing the people the right to free choice. If the United States Government had not acted, there might now be a second <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> in the Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> agreed and thanked the President for prompt United States intervention. He added that he and his people, as well as the whole Hemisphere, were aware of how the United States had saved the Dominican Republic from the threat of communism. It is true that many Dominicans, and also some other Hemispheric leaders, donʼt always state this clearly because they prefer to use demagogy for their own political reasons. The great majority of the Dominican people are fully aware of the reasons for United States intervention. He also said that he would he happy to discuss the matter with his colleagues here as well as with the press.</p>

                        <p>The President invited Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to discuss some of the main problems facing his country at the present time. President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> stated that his country is eagerly awaiting favorable news regarding a larger sugar quota and that he would like to have a five year permanent quota of 600,000 tons, primarily from the Puerto Rican and Philippine short-falls. The President said that he did not know what our sugar requirements would be but that sympathetic consideration would be given to the case of the Dominican Republic when the overall sugar picture became known.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> said that upon his return to his country he would be asked what new support had been offered to him by the President of the United States. He indicated that he would like to be able to reply that the prospects in the field of sugar were good, that the President of the United States was interested in assisting in the development of the countryʼ water resources, and that he had promised him United States cooperation in this and other matters.</p>
                        <p>The President said that while he certainly desired to be helpful, his ability to carry this out was a different story. He said he did not know what the sugar short-fall for this year would be, that the Foreign Assistance Bill had not yet been considered by Congress and might encounter serious difficulties, but that as soon as the framework of decisions became known the Dominican Republic would be given very sympathetic consideration.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> thanked the President for his assistance and continued support.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The future course of the Dominican Republic is of great importance to the United States for three inter-related reasons: (a) its strategic location in the Caribbean chain of islands which puts it on our geographic doorstep and very close to Communist Cuba; (b) the primitiveness and fragility of its political, economic, social and military institutions, which make for chronic instability and consequent vulnerability to extremism; and (c) the serious damage to our interests which would be caused by the assumption of power in another Caribbean country by forces inimical to us.</p>
                        <p>Four hundred years of political, economic and social underdevelopment, thirty years of corrosive dictatorship, and the last six years of political turbulence and instability have produced a nation and a people uncertain of themselves and their future, erratically searching for a national identity and character while yearning for democracy and the economic and social advances and the peace they associate with it. Political factors, demographic developments, economic and social inequities and proximity to Cuba have contributed to a chronic ferment on the national scene with youth perhaps the most volatile element.</p>
                        <p>The United States has a vital interest in denying this Caribbean nation to communism, including the Cuban variant. Related directly to this interest is the necessity to prevent a regression into authoritarianism of the right, with its almost certain consequence, in the Dominican environment, of enhancing communist prospects. Any long-term success in this regard must necessarily entail far-reaching economic, social and military reforms and the concomitant creation and strengthening of indigenous institutions which today lack wholly or in part the capability to assure stability and progress or to strengthen the nation against domestic or foreign subversion. From the standpoint of the inter-American system, it is equally important that the Dominican <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0493"/>Republic be strengthened to the point where it may function as an independent, fully sovereign and responsible member of the international community.</p>
                        <p>Circumstances of geography and history—but only secondarily economics—have deeply involved the United States in developments in the Dominican Republic. Many factors favor our exercising a significant influence. The first is our very proximity, which predisposes many Dominicans to accept as inevitable a very important U.S. role. A second is the crucial need of the Dominican Republic for our economic and technical assistance. A third is a combination of the first two: the unusually developed tendency of many Dominicans in all walks of life to view the United States as the arbiter of their nationʼ destinies, for good or for evil. It is easy and dangerous, however, to overestimate the extent to which even a powerful nation can at this moment in history work its will on a weak neighbor. The recent history of U.S. involvement in this country has emphasized certain inherent limitations on the exercise of our influence. First, there are the restraints placed on U.S. policies and actions by a decent regard for domestic and international opinion and by the ultimate ability of the Dominicans to have recourse to international organizations against real or alleged abuses of our influence. Second, the degree to which our prestige has become committed here is in itself an element which Dominicans, in and out of power, can use to resist our influence in matters in which their and our interests diverge because they realize the very restricted alternatives we have under present circumstances. Underlying these other limitations on our influence is the basic, persistent fact of the essential primitivism of Dominican society, politics and institutions which often vitiates, distorts or frustrates our inputs, be they political, economic, social or military. Our very special importance in the Dominican Republic gives us an uncommon ability and opportunity to counsel, persuade and guide; it does not give us the power to command.</p>
                        <p>Following the revolution of April 1965, our immediate objective had to be the restoration of order in the Dominican Republic and a return to legally elected constitutional government and, once this was accomplished, the maintenance of sufficient political stability and economic progress to enable the Government to carry out its mandate. Over the long run, we seek to promote the existence in the Dominican Republic of democratic governments, operating from a sound economic, social and military base, friendly to the United States and disposed to cooperate with us on vital issues in international forums. In moving toward that basic objective, we seek a citizenry better informed about, and prepared to construct and support, democratic institutions and a way of life based upon the rule of law and respect for the rights of others. As an indispensable concomitant, we seek the strengthening and rationalization of the Dominican economy and a balance-of <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0494"/>payments equilibrium so that domestic and foreign resources can be most effectively utilized in a comprehensive and effective program of economic and social development and reform, which will assure meaningful and tangible progress toward the correction of economic and social inequities. Finally, we seek a small, professional, apolitical security establishment which acts as a positive, rather than, as in the past, a negative force in the political, economic and social development of the country.</p>
                        <p>Our over-all strategy to accomplish these objectives inevitably engages us in most aspects of Dominican national life. We are utilizing very substantial financial and technical assistance and encouraging appropriate domestic and foreign investment in order first to stabilize and then develop the Dominican economy along modern lines and to stimulate and accelerate social reforms. As part of this effort we are trying to raise the low average effectiveness of human resources and of the countryʼ economic and social institutions. We support and emphasize publicly and privately the concept of legal, constitutional government and the democratic process. Through material and technical assistance, training and indoctrination we work toward a security force that is effective, compatible with the countryʼ needs, responsive to civil authority, apolitical, and ready to perform a positive supporting role in the countryʼ progress. Finally, we employ these multiple U.S. inputs so as to persuade the Dominican Government and people to commit themselves and their own resources in a manner permitting long-run, self-sustaining economic, social and political development while avoiding resort to violence and disorder.</p>
                        <p>The broad policies which flow from this strategy are producing undramatic but measurable progress toward our principal goals, and they require no major adjustments.</p>

                            <item>The tensions and turmoils which are endemic in Dominican politics have recently been exacerbated by developments following the attempt to assassinate General <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Antonio Imbert Barrera</persName> in March. Chances are, however, that President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will continue to maneuver adroitly enough to retain power during the period of this estimate.</item>
                            <label>B.</label>
                            <item>The military leadership will probably hold together behind <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. We do not think that these men have given up the idea that the military establishment is the final political arbiter, but they accept <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ policies and they see no viable alternative to him.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ political opposition on the extreme left is in disagreement and disarray and likely to remain so for some time. One or more of the Communist splinters may again undertake sporadic urban terrorism; any attempts they might make at insurgency in the countryside will probably be unsuccessful.</item>
                            <label>D.</label>
                            <item>We see more reason for concern in the possibility that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> might become increasingly vulnerable to charges of neo-Trujillismo. This is an issue on which he is already under attack from important civilian elements of left and right. These opponents of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will almost certainly seek adherents among the military; however, we think it unlikely that they will enlist enough military support during the period of this estimate for a successful coup.</item>
                            <label>E.</label>
                            <item>Even so, the combination of political and economic pressures on <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> could impel him to adopt a more authoritarian mode of government.</item>

                            <item>The performance of the Dominican economy will continue to be spotty—better than the bad year 1966, but with a high level of unemployment and a large trade deficit. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will almost certainly come under increasing pressure to raise taxes and perhaps to devalue—either of which would intensify his political problems.</item>

                            <item>In a speech in late February, President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName> likened Dominican politics to “a nest of tarantulas.” We would not fault his judgment on the matter. Intrigue, venality, corruption, arbitrariness have long been the rule, not the exception, among Dominican officials. Plotting against the government has been a favorite national pastime, and since 1961, when the assassination of Trujillo ended 30 years of absolute and brutal dictatorship, there have been seven changes of government.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Much the most serious outbreak was the revolution in April 1965 which came near to full civil war; order was restored only after the landing of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops and the stationing in the Dominican Republic of an Inter-American Peace Force, numbering at one stage some 26,000. In June 1966, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was chosen President in an orderly election and since then political affairs have moved in a smoother fashion. But the fears and enmities of the past are still operative and much of the governmentʼ time and energy must go to efforts simply to keep the lid on. In March 1967, the attempt to assassinate General <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Antonio Imbert Barrera</persName> brought a revival of tension.</item>

                            <item>Despite his past close association with the Trujillo dictatorship, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is personally honest and is regarded by most Dominicans as an intellectual. He is eager to advance the general welfare and believes that the Dominican Republic needs strong leadership. Lacking a strong political base, he conceives of governing primarily in terms of political maneuver and manipulation of the individuals and interest groups with the most political weight. He tends to be highly suspicious of any he sees as potential rivals; he does not typically appoint strong figures to Cabinet posts; he delegates little responsibility and then usually only to his inner circle of influential advisors, who probably even more than the President, distrust the opposition and lean toward authoritarian methods. Oftentimes his motivation in making a new appointment or in undertaking some more complicated maneuver appears obscure, perhaps because he seems to act in response to pressures from the inner circle. He is intensely concerned about all actions and tactics of opposition parties, and he has come to regard a number of the leaders of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>ʼs left-of-center Dominican Revolutionary Party (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>) as little better than Communists.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has had fair success in his various maneuvers to keep organized opposition groups divided and off balance. He has neutralized <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0497"/>a few of their leaders by means of Cabinet jobs or other patronage, and he has quietly done what he could to encourage their natural tendencies to fragment or simply become less active. However, his political style and policies have encouraged the “outs” to collaborate in opposition to the “ins.”</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>The <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> administrationʼ program has not attracted wide political support. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ lack of political appeal comes partly from his austerity measures, such as tighter controls on imports, reduction of government budgetary expenditures, a trimming of some salaries, a cutback in the number of unnecessary employees in the big government sugar enterprise, a harder try at collecting taxes. To convince the vested interests of the necessity for such unpalatable measures is never easy and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ style of governing has not made it easier. Efforts at economic development are gaining momentum, but such efforts are concentrated in the countryside with little being either undertaken or accomplished in Santo Domingo. Also, because of the continued political violence, important political segments have been alienated. Perhaps the strongest thing going for him in the broad relationship of his government with the politically influential elements is their reluctance to take the risk of another civil war.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>In concentrating on various political manipulations, the Dominican President has foregone any systematic effort to turn his Reformist Party (<gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>) into an active, enduring political base, and he lacks the personality to enhance his mass appeal. The fact that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> carried some 57 percent of the vote in the elections of June 1966 does not mean that he has anything close to that degree of effective political support at present, because the great majority of Dominicans tend to be politically apathetic between elections.<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">The population is predominantly rural and less than 65 percent literate. In the Dominican elections in December 1962, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> won with a higher percentage of the total than did <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in 1966. Yet when the Dominican military leaders ousted <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> in September 1963, there was no significant public protest. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Political interest is, of course, sustained to a much greater extent in Santo Domingo than generally in the countryside, where <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ strength has been greater.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>A major weak point for <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is his vulnerability to charges of neo-Trujillismo. Although most Dominicans (including <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>) absolve him from the excesses of the Trujillo era, a number have a real and passionate fear of a possible return to the brutal Trujillo methods, and a number of others find convenient political ammunition in the issue. Moreover, certain of the governmentʼ actions have lent themselves to ominous interpretations by opponents both on the left and the right. Sometimes they picture him as the leader, sometimes as the captive of a neo-Trujillista clique. As evidence, they point to his former chief military <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0498"/>aide, Colonel Neit Nivar Seijas, and several other Presidential advisors, who are trusted <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> colleagues from Trujillo days. They also cite police excesses—specifically the roundup in late January of 500–800 “leftists” suspected of plotting. And they express alarm at a series of political murders which the administration is seemingly unable to prevent. Some of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ opponents have gone a step farther and charged that his governmentʼ resumption and conduct of relations with the Duvalier government of Haiti is also a sign of Trujilloist tendencies.</item>

                                <hi rend="italic">Neo-Trujillismo</hi> has become the most important issue as a result of the assassination attempt in March against the perennial rightwing plotter General <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>. In an effort to squelch widespread rumors that the assassins were backed by some of his own advisors, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has taken several actions to show his determination to solve the crime and deal resolutely with the perpetrators. His administration has offered a $25,000 reward. He has appointed as new Minister of Interior and Police, Luis Amiama Tio, <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>ʼs longtime associate and fellow survivor of the group that killed Trujillo. And he has said that Amiama would have a free hand to carry out the investigation.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>However effective in quieting immediate criticism over the <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> affair, the appointment of Amiama to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ Cabinet has admitted a highly disruptive influence into the government. A man with political aspirations of his own, Amiama represents elements of the anti-Trujillo oligarchy whose prerogatives have been limited by <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and who have long been at swords point with him and his intimates because of their past roles in the Trujillo government. Amiama has already managed to force out of office one of his old enemies, the chief of the national police. And he is causing the investigation to be pursued in the military establishment so intensively as to produce considerable resentment. Apart from official maneuverings, Amiama has also been meeting with <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> Secretary General Jose Francisco Pena Gomez whom he may hope to use to further his own ambitions.</item>

This is reflected in the Presidentʼ connections with the Trujillista Colonel Nivar, formerly his chief military aide and at present commanding officer of the First Brigade in Santo Domingo; Nivar is widely suspected and despised within the armed forces. Many of the military leaders who support <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> do so because it is advantageous to them at present, because they approve of many of his policies and because they see no better alternative. At the same time the armed forces have continued to function as a powerful interest group, and we believe they have not given up the idea that the military establishment is the final political arbiter in the Dominican Republic.</item>

                            <item>A key position in the military is that of Secretary of State for the Armed Forces, who acts as Minister of Defense and has also assumed certain prerogatives of the Service Chiefs. As a buffer between the President and the Chiefs of the Services, he has the task of reconciling what hitherto have been irreconcilables—a civilian chief executive and the Dominican military establishment. At present, the position is held by General Enrique Perez Y Perez, who was appointed <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0500"/>under the Provisional Government but who seems fairly responsive to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and has so far managed to retain the support of the Service Chiefs. Perez y Perez has been subject to growing criticism from below, however, particularly for his cooperation with Amiama in pressing the investigation among the military of the <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> shooting. The present Service Chiefs of the army and navy appear to be loyal to the government and to have reasonable control over their officers. The air force is traditionally less disciplined and its officers are more susceptible to rightist coup overtures.</item>

                            <item>The leading opposition party, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼ<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, has lost considerable ground. It is still suffering from the shock of defeat and the defection into <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ Cabinet of some of its conservative and moderate leadership. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>ʼ attempt to take a position of “creative opposition” was rejected by the administration. <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> leaders were harassed by the police, party stalwarts have been fired from government jobs, and its minority representation in the legislature has been all but ignored. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> was especially bitter over what it regarded as government persecution in condoning if not actually initiating police attacks on former Constitutionalists. Except in Santo Domingo, the party has lost much influence in its former bailiwicks. It no longer has a stronghold in labor or in the State Sugar Council, and its hold on the Santo Domingo city government is under attack from the government as well as from party dissidents.</item>

                            <item>The feeling of persecution, combined with the defection of key <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> moderates, has enabled a more militant group to take over the leadership. The elder statesman of the party, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>, now in voluntary exile in Europe, has more or less abdicated, and his young protégé, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, has taken the helm. The new <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> leaders have responded to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ offer of a “dialogue” with them by saying that there could be no dialogue until <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> took steps to end persecutions and eliminate corruption. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>ʼ former partner on the democratic left, the smaller Revolutionary Social Christian Party (<gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>) cautiously agreed to a dialogue, but remains basically critical of the government. Although the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> has threatened that it would organize a “resistance movement regardless of ideologies” if the present situation continues, it has also said that it would not work to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> unless all other forms of protest were silenced. The meetings with Amiama suggest that the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> expects that a move against <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> may come from the right.</item>

                            <item>The extreme left, always divided, has further fragmented. The three major extremist parties still exist: the Revolutionary Movement of 14 June (MR1J4), the Dominican Popular Movement (<gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss>) and the Dominican Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PCD1">PCD</gloss>). The MR1J4, largest of the three, <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0501"/>and the only one permitted to participate in the June 1966 elections, has suffered the greatest setback. Its percentage of the vote was far below the minimum required to keep it a legal party. Since then some of its leaders have defected to the <gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss> and have urged that the organization now be regarded as the true party of the proletariat.<gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss> strength has suffered, however, from the expulsion of a group for trying to act as a “Red Guard”; this splinter proceeded to institutionalize itself into the Communist Party of the Dominican Republic (PCRD). The founder of the <gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss> had been ousted earlier; he has formed still another group, the Orthodox Communist Party (PCO). Despite their differences and small numbers, the extremists have some strength or influence among students and in labor. Leadership of one labor confederation, FOUPSA-CESITRADO, is divided between representatives of the <gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss> and the MR1J4.<note n="4" xml:id="d197fn4">The actual number of adherents to these various extremist parties is hard to determine accurately, since their memberships are in such a state of flux. Our best estimate are:<gloss target="#t_PCD1">PCD</gloss>—100; <gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss>—250; PCRD—50; PCO—25; MR1J4—600. These five parties vary widely in the extent to which their ideology and aims can be identified with those of foreign Communists, whether Soviet, Chinese, or Cuban. One or another has solicited support from each of these external sources, but without significant success. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>

                            <item>The most distinct threat to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in the short run comes from his opponents among the economic and social elite. Many of them were former members of the defunct National Civic Union and controlled economic and political life during the tenure of the Council of State and under the <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> government. They more than other groups chafed under Trujillo and after his death took a far more anti-Trujillo stand than did the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>. Aligned with this grouping are Amiama and <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>, the two surviving members of the conspiracy to assassinate Trujillo. The potential of these elements to embarrass <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is high, but their potential to overthrow him depends, more than anything else, on the amount of support they can obtain among the Dominican military.</item>

                            <item>Blessed with some of the most fertile land in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic has been cursed by the inability of generations of Dominicans to use it effectively. The ratio of people to land is already fairly high, and the rate of population growth (estimated at 3.5 percent annually) is probably one of the highest in the world. Agriculture absorbs half the labor force and produces some 35 percent of the GNP. Per capita GNP is considerably below the average for Latin America. The problems of underemployment in agriculture and unemployment in the urban areas are chronic.</item>

                            <item>The economy was seriously disrupted by the revolution of April 1965; GNP fell nearly 15 percent, unemployment rose to perhaps 30 percent of the urban labor force, sugar production decreased, and there was a sharp drop in export earnings. Recovery has been painfully slow: it remains a major aim of the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> government merely to restore the economy to the level of 1964. In 1966, the GNP increased modestly but probably less than the growth in population. There was no significant reduction in the level of unemployment. The administration of economic affairs suffered from ineptitude in the bureaucracy and from <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ insistence on personal supervision over most financial transactions. The government was not able to realize its goal for public investment, and private investors held back to “wait and see.” In spite of an unusual increase in the Dominican sugar quota for sale to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, the total value of Dominican exports remained below that for 1964, and the trade deficit was the largest in Dominican history. In short, even with an infusion of about $70 million in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic aid, the overall Dominican economic performance was poor.</item>

                            <item>On the positive side, the government has provided some encouragement to private investors and has started a number of its own development projects, primarily in the basic agricultural sector. Efforts are being made to improve the technical level of Dominican agriculture, improve the farm credit system, rehabilitate the irrigation system, extend and improve market roads, bring new land into cultivation, diversify production, and to improve the general level of education in the countryside. It is too early for these projects to show much accomplishment but some results are evident, and a foundation is being set for future progress.</item>

                            <item>The government also has established basic policies designed to prevent inflation. Budget deficits have been held within limits that could be financed without internal borrowing and a substantial number of surplus workers have been discharged from the public payrolls and from the government-owned portion of the sugar industry. Most wages have been held in line, although <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> found it prudent to rescind earlier cuts in salaries of the military and high government officials. The fiscal and wage restraints undoubtedly slowed the pace of economic recovery, but were probably necessary in view of the unusual danger of inflation in the Dominican economy.</item>

                            <item>The major issue intensifying divisions between pro and antigovernment groups will be neo-Trujillismo. As the contest between these groupings continues, the likelihood increases that military officers will be drawn in on one side or the other. Certainly one of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼ main preoccupations during the next year or so will be to prevent the emergence of a rightist civilian-military combination against him. <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0503"/>Although he will attempt to maneuver around and through rightist civilian groups, he may eventually be forced to make a hard choice among them.

Relations between the government and the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> are likely to continue cool but not hostile. Relations between the government and the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> will almost certainly deteriorate further. We think it unlikely, however, that the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, as a party, will choose during the period of this estimate to go into violent opposition to the government and make common cause with the extreme left. A small number of radical <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> members may, of course, do precisely that. A more likely course for the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> leadership would be de facto collaboration with Amiama and some elements of the anti-Trujillista right.</item>

The Communists may resume sporadic urban terrorism, particularly in Santo Domingo, but any attempts they may make at insurgency at the countryside will probably prove unsuccessful.</item>

                            <item>The marriage of convenience between <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and the military leadership will probably remain essentially intact for the next year or so. There will be frictions, and a few in the military are likely to engage in plotting with anti-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> politicians. The military may come to exercise a somewhat greater degree of influence on the President than it does now; in any case, he is likely to move cautiously, if at all, on policy changes which would directly affect the military, e.g., the military budget, the salaries and allowances, accepted devices for graft, plans to restructure the military establishment. On most other matters, however, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will probably continue to reach decisions without military counsel although he will, of course, keep military attitudes in mind; we do not think he will become a “prisoner” of the military.</item>

                            <item>The economy will do better in some ways in 1967 than it did in 1966, but the improvements will not generally be of the kind that bring political dividends. The recovery in GNP will probably be at a higher rate than in 1966, though the level of GNP is unlikely to exceed that of 1964. The amount of investment, particularly in the public sector, will probably increase. At the same time, the value of exports will remain relatively low, and the trade deficit could run more than $80 million, its level in 1966. Import controls will have to be maintained, and the inflationary pressure, contained thus far, will probably grow. <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0504"/>
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will almost certainly come under increasing pressure to raise taxes and perhaps to devalue—either of which would pose major political problems, particularly with respect to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs rightwing opponents.</item>

                            <item>In any case, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> backing will continue to be an essential pillar of support for <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. This backing cannot insure that he will retain power, but loss of it would hurt him badly. If, for instance, the Dominican military came to feel that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was withdrawing its backing or becoming lukewarm about it, the chances of a coup would rise precipitously. A severe cut in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic aid would thus not only have major economic repercussions, but would undermine <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs political power position as well. In a way, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid relationship to the Dominican Republic has become similar to the Soviet aid relationship to Cuba—though on a much less expensive scale.</item>

                            <item>Assuming continuation of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support, chances are that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will maneuver adroitly enough in the primitive arena of Dominican politics to retain power during the next year or so. Nevertheless, charges of neo-Trujillismo could weaken his tenure by producing a new and stronger alignment of forces against him. Furthermore, assassination is still a standard political tactic in the Dominican Republic, and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has his full quota of political enemies.</item>

                                <item>A series of factors—(1) the investigation which points to the Trujillista military stronghold at the San Isidro Air Base as the focus of the anti-<persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> plot, (2) Defense Minister Perezʼs cooperation with Amiama in pressing the investigation against military elements, and (3) Amiamaʼs success in forcing <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to make some important changes in the Police and his Military Household—have made the military a little edgy for the first time since the inauguration.</item>

                        <p>The attached memoranda from Bill Gaud and Charlie Schultze recommend that you approve a $5 million Supporting Assistance loan to finance an emergency urban development program in Santo Domingo. <persName corresp="#p_GAL1">Linc Gordon</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> are the originators of the request.<note n="2" xml:id="d199fn2">Following this sentence <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> wrote: “Sect. Fowler concurred.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The loan is designed to buy some insurance against social unrest and political tensions in Santo Domingo by generating employment for some 3,000 people through city improvement projects.</p>
                        <p>I do not agree with Charlie Schultzeʼs comment that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is not as concerned about potential unrest in Santo Domingo as we are and is unwilling to spend his own money. He shares our concern over the danger of the disgruntled urban unemployed. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">John Crimmins</persName> is convinced that if <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> had the funds to spend on this program, he would do so. But he does not and would welcome our assistance. Where we differ with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is that he looks upon the urban program essentially as a means of reducing his security problem, while we think that by demonstrating the interest of the central government in the urban poor, he can build up political support which he very much needs.</p>
                        <p>The funds for the loan are available. While I would like to see us get away from Supporting Assistance in the Dominican Republic, I think it is in our interest to make this small investment to head off a potential source of trouble.</p>
                        <p>I recommend you approve the loan.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Bill Gaud has asked you to approve a $5 million Supporting Assistance loan to finance an emergency urban development program in Santo Domingo</hi>, Dominican Republic. This will be in addition to the $40 million Supporting Assistance loan authorized last June to finance investment expenditures in the Dominican budget. The final part of that loan was released last month and is fully committed to high priority programs in the rural sector.</p>
                            <p>
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Supporting Assistance funds for FY 1967 have been fully programmed, but the $5 million requested for this emergency loan is available from the Contingency Fund.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">The justification for this loan is purely political</hi>.Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> reports that growing unemployment in Santo Domingo and increasing radical activity by the leftist opposition have created political tensions which threaten the stability of the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> regime. The purpose of the loan is to reduce the possibility of a political explosion in Santo Domingo.</p>
                            <p>In January 1967 the cityʼs budget situation forced the firing of 2,700 people. The emergency program to be financed by the loan will generate employment for 3,000 people on street and sewage projects, initiate an urban community development program, and expand loans to small businesses.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, <hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> does not regard the problem in Santo Domingo as seriously as does Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName>
                                </hi>. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs position is as follows:

                                    <item>He is not convinced that this kind of program will improve his position in Santo Domingo, where opposition elements dominate the city.</item>

                            <p>In view of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs position, and the lack of self-help provisions, I would normally be reluctant to recommend this loan for your approval.

The loan will be made from the <hi rend="italic">Supporting Assistance</hi> appropriation which authorizes funds to promote <hi rend="italic">political</hi> stability with no specific requirement for self-help as is required for development loans.</p>
                            <p>Bill Gaud, <persName corresp="#p_GAL1">Linc Gordon</persName>, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> agree that <hi rend="italic">any future assistance to the Dominican Republic for urban programs should require greater self-help and be provided as a development loan</hi>.</p>

                            <p>The dollars made available under this loan will be tied to U.S. procurement.

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> reviewed the Dominican situation along the lines of the attached paper. He described the events which took place yesterday in the Dominican Republic—the clash with a small band of guerrillas in the north and fire-bomb attack against <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> Senator Casimiro <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> in Santo Domingo. He thought that the second attack could have as much, or more, of an unsettling effect on the fragile political situation as the March 21 assassination attempt against <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> project was considered in detail. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> described the immediate objective of the project—to help <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> wrest control of the leadership of student organization at the University of Santo Domingo from the communists—and the longer term goals—reinforcing the hand of <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> leader Jaonabo Javier, strengthening the PRCS as a political party and contributing toward general institution building in the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss>. He stated that the risk of disclosure was low because the <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> had been asking Dominican businessmen for money and this was public knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> withdrew his earlier objection to the <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> proposal and those present representing the 303 Committee gave their approval.<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2">A May 8 memorandum for the record of the 303 Committee May 5 meeting, immediately following the review group meeting reported that “Although Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> reiterated certain reservations about the proposal, he cast his vote with the majority view.

                            </p>
                            <p>The attempted assassination of <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> on March 21 has been the single most important political event since the last (December) review of short-term courses of action,<note n="5" xml:id="d200fn5">See the attachment to <ref target="#d187">Document 187</ref>.</note> and indeed since <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs assumption of office ten months ago.</p>
                            <p>Prior to March 21, the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> Government, in spite of several important weaknesses, had made progress in consolidating itself. While not eliminated, the polarizing trends giving rise to concern in the last review had not intensified and in fact had probably weakened. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> was continuing its total opposition to the Government and expressing it in efforts to construct a broad “anti-Trujillista” movement without regard to ideology. On balance, however, this attitude was reducing somewhat the support for the leadership within the Party and in the country as a whole. The erosion of the Partyʼs position was also attributable in part to various pressures exerted against it by the Government, which harbored deep distrust and suspicion of the intentions of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> leadership. Moreover, the posture of strong but “constructive” opposition of the Social Christians (<gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>), with constitutionalist credentials as valid as those of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, tended at once to underline the radical stance of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and to strengthen <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs position. The Communists, engaged in bitter internecine struggles, were weak. The “Civico” (anti-Trujillista) right was in touch with the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> but ineffective. The great bulk of the military accepted or supported <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, with only isolated centers manifesting low-key discontent. Labor was unhappy but essentially passive. The general economic atmosphere, although reflecting little progress toward correction of basic disequilibrium, and affected adversely by the deflationary tendencies induced by austerity and by administrative and technical ineptness on the part of the Government, was improving as business confidence and optimism about a continuation of stability became almost palpable. This general picture of uneven, flawed but perceptible progress was marred by continuing incidents of excesses by the police against the citizenry, perhaps especially <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> adherents. These incidents were being considerably exaggerated by the opposition to the Government, but <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0511"/>there was sufficient validity in the opposition charges to create uneasiness about <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs willingness or ability to control the police, and, by extension, to give limited currency to opposition charges of “neo-Trujillista” tendencies in the Government.</p>
                            <p>The incident of March 21 and its aftermath introduced considerable fluidity into the political environment and weakened the Government. In the process, the essential and persistent fragility of the political structure has been clearly demonstrated. The attack on <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> has stimulated and gained adherents for the “anti-Trujillista” forces and placed the Government at least temporarily on the defensive. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> has exploited the situation, but it has been the “Civico” right which has taken principal advantage of the new circumstances in an effort to resuscitate itself. Rumors of plotting have burgeoned, and some “Civicos” are talking of an “Ongania solution,” with Wessin y Wessin cast in the lead. (This aggressiveness on the part of the perennially golpe-minded right may give pause to its potential sympathizer—and former blood enemy—the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>.) The <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> clings to its line of “constructive” opposition, but within the Party there are pressures, enhanced by the <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> attempt and its aftermath, to abandon that position in favor of flat-out opposition to the Government. In the military, especially the Air Force, the persistent opponents of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> are becoming somewhat more vocal, but we have no evidence yet of firm plotting. In the economic sector, the effects of the political uneasiness have been direct and swift. The mood of clear optimism in early March which appeared to override the effects of austerity has been replaced by one of, at best, caution and uncertainty.</p>
                            <p>Despite the clearly negative consequences for <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> of the <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> incident and the period of political maneuvering it produced, the situation is not critical but, rather, uneasy. The President almost certainly has the support of the majority of Dominicans, who still believe in him personally and who see no alternative to him, even though that support is not readily organizable or mobilizable because, in part, of the weakness of the Reformista Party. He still has basic military support. He has the support of the United States. And he appears confident of his authority. Against these strengths are set:

                                <hi rend="italic">Background:</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>During your conversations with President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> at Punta del Este last month he asked you to assign the Dominican Republic a special deficit allocation in order to raise the Dominican sugar quota in the United States market to at least 600,000 tons this year. President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was reflecting a request previously made by the Dominican Government for an annual quota of 600,000 tons for the next five years. Last year the Dominican Republic received a special allocation of 123,000 tons from the Philippine and Panamanian share of the Puerto Rican deficit. Its total quota for 1966 was 603,000 tons.</p>
                            <p>We believe it would be in the national interest to assign the Dominican Republic a substantial special allocation again this year, but not to meet its request in full. We recommend a special allocation of about 105,000 tons, which will raise the Dominican quota to 590,000 tons. This figure will be well above the quota of any other Latin American supplier, evidencing our continuing support for the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> Government and our satisfaction with the progress it has made in the past year toward solution of the sugar industryʼs problems. At the same time it will establish our intent gradually to phase out preferential treatment for the Dominican Republic in assigning sugar quotas. This will serve the dual purpose of (1) reassuring other Latin American suppliers that we are not neglectful of their interest in an expanded market in the United States and (2) place additional pressure on the Dominican sugar industry to reduce costs and become competitive in world markets.</p>
                            <p>The Dominican Government has been making vigorous and politically courageous efforts to improve the efficiency of the state-owned sector of the sugar industry and to diversify out of sugar production. In this first year of President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs administration, production costs in the state sugar industry have been cut by somewhat more than <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0517"/>two cents a pound. To continue this program, the State Sugar Council is contracting for the services of American consultant firms to draw up a detailed program of rationalization and diversification that will be eligible for international financing.</p>
                            <p>We do not believe that a special allocation should be granted unconditionally. Rather, we should take the opportunity to further developmental activities—while at the same time decreasing somewhat the potential requirement for <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> assistance—through promoting rationalization of the sugar industry and diverting excess sugar lands to the production of food and other crops.</p>
                            <p>To this end we propose that a part of the proceeds of the sale of this sugar be set aside in a special fund for mutually agreed programs. We will try to reach agreement with the Dominican Government to set aside 2 cents a pound, which would provide a fund of about $4.2 million. At a minimum we would require a set-aside of1½cents a pound, for a prospective fund of about $3.2 million. While small in terms of total financing required for the projects to be developed, the proposed fund would assure that, when approved, the projects could be started promptly.</p>
                            <p>Several other Latin American countries have asked for preferential treatment this year in reallocation of the Puerto Rican deficit. These countries will be disappointed if the Dominican Republic alone receives a special allocation. Furthermore, all countries in the Western Hemisphere will receive smaller allocations than they had anticipated if preferential treatment is accorded the Dominican Republic. We may expect protests from some. However, we would be able to cite the recommendation by the <gloss target="#t_CIAP1">CIAP</gloss> subcommittee on the Dominican Republic that special treatment be given that country in sugar deficit allocations this year. Moreover, since the Philippines have turned back their share of the deficits, other Western Hemisphere countries will receive slightly larger quotas in the United States market than they did in 1966, even if the Dominican Republic receives a special allocation of about 105,000 tons.</p>
                            <p>While the language of the proposed directive provides for a special allocation of about 105,000 tons, the practical effect of such an allocation would be to give the Dominican Republic about 85,000 tons more than it would have received in the absence of such an allocation. The use of the higher figure in the proposed directive results from the complicated formula which the Department of Agriculture is required to use in administering the Sugar Act.<note n="5" xml:id="d201fn5">Reference is to Section 204(a) of the Sugar Act of 1948, as amended by the Sugar Act Amendments of 1965. (79 Stat. 1275)</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>No other country in the Hemisphere is as dependent as the Dominican Republic on finding a satisfactory market for its sugar. Furthermore, <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0518"/>there is mention in the legislative history of the Sugar Act of the possibility of a substantial increase in the Dominican quota through reallocation of deficits. It should be noted that imposing conditions on the entry of Dominican sugar that are not imposed on other countries could be considered technically inconsistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Nevertheless, we do not anticipate any objections on GATT grounds.</p>
                            <p>I believe, therefore, that the granting of a special allocation of about 105,000 tons would be in the national interest and would be consistent with the legislative history of the Sugar Act.</p>

                        <p>Up until March 21—when unknown assailants tried to kill <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>—<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was making slow but steady progress in consolidating his political position. Months of relative stability had given the business community a new confidence and the economy was starting to gather some momentum.</p>
                        <p>Since March, the political and economic climate has changed and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs position weakened. Failure to solve the <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName> case—followed by a series of other murders and attempted murders—has made the public apprehensive. The economic sector is uneasy and cautious. And anti-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> elements on the right and left have launched a campaign to pin the “Trujillista” label on him. As might be expected the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> is in the forefront of this effort.</p>

                        <p>The most important of these is to persuade <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to curb terrorism and restore public confidence. He has taken two steps in this direction:

                                <item>—appointment of a high level committee to make a thorough investigation of the National Police Force, which is suspected of being involved in some of the terrorism.

                                <p>Following the approval of the operation, the political atmosphere at the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo (UASD) deteriorated to such an extent that it was believed that a confrontation between FRAGUA (the Communist-supported student group) and <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> would lead to bloodshed. Rather than risk this confrontation, <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> decided to boycott the elections. In calling for a boycott of the student elections, <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> hoped to limit student participation to such a degree that it could later have the elections cancelled. Another factor which <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> considered in making its decision to boycott the elections was the fact that the Student Council, controlled by FRAGUA, had set the elections for 23 May 1967, thereby not allowing <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> sufficient time for campaigning prior to the elections. Given the above situation and <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss>ʼs assessment that without an extensive campaign it could not hope to win the elections, the need for an operation to support <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss> in the elections no longer existed.</p>

                            <item>Student elections were held on 23 May 1967 as scheduled. The elections were held amid a flurry of Communist propaganda including the use of Soviet flags which were flown higher than the Dominican flag on the campus. FRAGUA won easily since it was not opposed by the only other major student organization, <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss>. Only 20 per cent (1,421) of the student body participated in the elections. Of those, 1,118 voted for FRAGUA, 230 for FUSD (the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> student group), and 73 for the Communist Youth group. Even with the abstention of <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss>, the elections were wrought with violence which erupted between the Communist Youth and FRAGUA. These events appeared to confirm <gloss target="#t_BRUC1">BRUC</gloss>ʼs estimate that had it participated in the elections the UASD would have seen one of its bloodiest student elections.</item>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Herewith are memoranda from <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName>, Freeman<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">Attached was a 2-page memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> and Freeman, dated October 30, in which they recommended that the President authorize them “to negotiate a <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 sales agreement with the Dominican Republic to provide approximately 15,000 tons of soybean oil, 30,000 tons of wheat, 12,000 tons of tallow, 5,600 bales of cotton, 933 tons of tobacco, and other items for export totalling a market value of $12.3 million.” The Departments of State and the Treasury concurred in this recommendation.</note> and Schultze on a $12 million <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 loan to the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>There is agreement on the size and nature of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 loan but not on the timing of negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> and Freeman prefer to proceed immediately. Schultze recommends delay until the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 agreement can be combined with our <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Supporting Assistance negotiating package. The delay would be for 4–5 weeks.</p>
                        <p>Charlie argues that our leverage in negotiating self-help conditions will be increased by making <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> one package. He also notes that the Dominicans are obtaining the commodities they need under reimbursable purchase authorizations and the amounts involved are so small that they would have no effect on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> prices.</p>
                        <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0522"/>
                        <p>There do not seem to be any compelling reasons why the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 agreement should be negotiated right away. Consequently, Charlieʼs recommendations of deferral until the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> are combined into one package seems reasonable.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 agreement with the Dominican Republic.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>I have no objection to their basic proposal. But <hi rend="italic">I recommend that we defer</hi> the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 negotiation until it can be <hi rend="italic">combined with negotiations on an <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Supporting Assistance loan</hi>—which will be ready for review in the next few weeks. By combining the two forms of assistance we <hi rend="italic">maximize our leverage</hi> for self-help conditions. We are trying to combine <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> loan negotiations wherever possible.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">
                                <hi rend="italic">Background</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>The commodities to be supplied are wheat (30,000 tons), soybean oil (15,000 tons), tallow, cotton, tobacco, oats, and cotton yarn. This will be <hi rend="italic">the first <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 agreement ever to include cotton textiles</hi>. (The textile interests got the law changed in 1966 to permit the full financing of cotton yarn and cloth.) The agreement would provide a <hi rend="italic">twenty-year dollar credit</hi>, with shipments made during this fiscal year.</p>
                            <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0523"/>
                            <p>Usual marketing requirements would be waived since most imports of these commodities have been financed by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> loans.</p>
                            <p>This assistance will ease the Dominicans’ <hi rend="italic">balance of payments problem</hi> and help finance public investment in agriculture. It is also intended to supplement domestic production damaged by drought.</p>
                            <p>Commitments will be sought from the government of the Dominican Republic to take several self-help actions in the agricultural sector, which will be financed mostly by the local currency proceeds of this loan.</p>
                            <p>A <hi rend="italic">$20 million Supporting Assistance <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> loan</hi>, also to provide balance of payments and budgetary support in FY 1968, has been requested by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName>. It will probably be ready for your review within the next few weeks. The key purpose of that negotiation is to influence the allocation of the Dominican budget for 1968. <hi rend="italic">The self-help measures to be negotiated with the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> loan will improve the effectiveness of our aid</hi>. They will include commitments to
<list>
                                    <item>—increase tax revenues and reduce military expenditures,</item>
                                    <item>—limit inflationary government borrowing,</item>
                                    <item>—establish procedures to promote greater export additionality for our aid.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>A good portion of the $12.3 million <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 agreement is a <hi rend="italic">budgetary cost to us</hi>. In view of the anticipated reduction in the Supporting Assistance appropriation, it is very important to utilize the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loan to the fullest extent possible to obtain the important overall self-help reforms we seek. $12.3 million represents a substantial resource for the Dominican budget. <hi rend="italic">Joint negotiation of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 and Supporting Assistance loans would strengthen our bargaining power and be consistent with your desire to treat <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 and dollar aid as equivalent resources</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Using <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 this year to negotiate budget and monetary policy will <hi rend="italic">lay the groundwork for similar joint dollar aid and <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 negotiations next year</hi>, when we will need all the economic leverage we can muster. We <hi rend="italic">face a critical negotiation</hi> with the Dominican Republic sometime after the municipal elections in May, <hi rend="italic">on the issue of devaluation</hi>. Without devaluation, continued high aid levels will bring little, if any, basic improvement in the Dominican economy or in the high level of unemployment.</p>
                            <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> and Freeman would prefer not to delay the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 agreement for joint negotiations, their reasons are not compelling. At worst, delay might cause some political embarrassment. However, holding the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 presents no real problem for us or the Dominicans because <hi rend="italic">the commodities are now being shipped under reimbursable purchase authorizations</hi>. The amounts of wheat and soybean oil involved in this agreement are so small that they would have <hi rend="italic">no effect on U.S. prices</hi>.</p>

                            <item>Two weeks—and especially this last, very active week—of intensive rumor-mongering and speculation concerning possible intentions of Wessin movement and alleged <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> shifting of its focus and support from <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to Wessin have produced local political situation best described as uneasy. Our vigorous public and private efforts dispel any impression of changing <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attitude appear to have achieved little significant or at least measurable success. By way of illustration, Vice Pres Lora considered it necessary raise what is being said concerning <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> posture during dinner with Emboffs Nov 16. Lora, who was strongly and categorically assured of straight-line <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support for <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, professed not believe rumors himself but said he wanted us know effect they seemed be having in key areas including palace.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>A. Present campaign has probably contributed to process of erosion in some areas of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs civilian (and possibly military) support, which process seems have been developing for some weeks and particularly since Wessinista <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss> presented request for recognition as political party to central electoral board late last month. <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>ʼs assertion <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0525"/>that it presented 125,000–150,000 signatures in support its claim to legal status seems have impressed many and, as reflected by wide variety Emb contacts, may be widely accepted at face value. To a man, however, some 25–30 non-Wessinista Emb contacts (including Lora, Col Nivar Seijas, <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> dissidents and moderates, and <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> leadershipʼs official channel to Emb) profess to view alleged <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss> strength decidedly in Golpista terms and only very secondarily in electoral terms. They seem impressed at least as much by rumors concerning <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>ʼs intentions as by their individual estimates its actual or potential strength. And in these rumors highly imaginative allegations concerning <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> posture weigh heavily.</item>
                            <label>B.</label>
                            <item>As Dept. is well aware, <gloss target="#t_DOMS1">Doms</gloss> in and out of office, of high or low estate, have in recent years demonstrated inordinate sensitivity to every nuance, real or imagined, of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policy. This unhealthy attitude, which is the price we pay for our heavy influence and involvement, is exploited constantly by political elements, sometimes positively but more often negatively. This chronic sensitivity has become acute in the past few weeks, basically because of Wessinista upsurge but also because of unsatisfactory economic conditions and, to a probably minor degree, apprehension over the Congressional cuts in aid funds. The result has been that rumors of a less than positive <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> attitude toward <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> have received wider currency and created more apprehension—even in relatively sophisticated circles—than at any other time since <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> took office.</item>

                            <item>We are continuing efforts counter these allegations, many of which concern charges made or echoed by relatively responsible elements that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> slowing down or diminishing aid to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in preparation for changeover to Wessin. Past week or two have seen public charges that there is serious friction between Emb and <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> on aid matters, aid is inadequate, aid will be cut, technicians withdrawn, or even entire USAID Mission to DomRep terminated. Amb plans deal as forthrightly as possible with issue in his long-scheduled address to American Chamber of Commerce Nov. 22. We can reasonably expect that this address will have dampening effect on current speculation, but are not sanguine that, in view limitations created by appropriations situation and current policy guidelines provided Emb (on, e.g., <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 negotiations), its effect will be long-lasting.</item>

He told <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>, according to latterʼs statement to Amb, he is uncertain about how to deal with situation and reportedly told Col. Tejeda Alvarez that Wessinʼs return at this time would create divisions in armed forces, a point also mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> told WRB<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">Presumably a reference to WGB, <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">William G.

                            <item>In conversation with Amb subsequent to his talk with <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>, Pres stated he not unduly concerned about Wessinista threat. At same meeting, however, Pres betrayed unusual sensitivity about fact that some military and civilian elements had interpreted routine political contacts by our Consulate in Santiago as <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support for <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>. Pres insisted, in response Ambʼs statements, he fully understood our position of support for him, but incident, in our judgment, betrays a certain amount of jitteriness and lowered morale on part Pres. With respect his morale, should be remembered we have hit him with very gloomy analysis 68 B/P and fiscal prospects without indicating, for reasons well known to Dept., what, if anything, we are prepared to do to help. We have also discussed with him in direct terms <gloss target="#t_GODR1">GODR</gloss> delinquencies on certain aid-financed activities (<gloss target="#t_ODC1">ODC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> Bank), although Pres stated he would meet all commitments, he may well feel that he is being squeezed at a time when his political problems are mounting.

They also profess conviction that Wessin, once here, would “demartyrize” self in relatively short period (2–3 months) and that situation would thus regain its previous if precariously balanced level.</item>

Even if we discount his own ability carry out his messianic political aspirations, Wessin appears fast becoming rallying point or symbol for disaffected political and business elements covering a broad spectrum who for variety of perhaps contradictory motivations and doctrines see in him potential instrument for upsetting present unsatisfactory (to them) status quo. And there is reason <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0527"/>believe Wessin still able command some loyalty in armed forces, particularly at lower levels.

                        <p>I am not losing my “cool” over recent developments in the Dominican Republic but events of the past ten days have contributed to an uneasy atmosphere in that fragile country.

                        <p>On the plus side, however, President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> seems to be firmly in the saddle, the military leadership, despite some in-fighting, appears to be behind him, the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> is not nearly the cohesive and broadly militant party that it used to be, and the people in general continue to seek stability and to avoid trouble.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is of course keeping a close watch on developments and has been requested to give us a current assessment as well as an indication of what, if anything, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ought to do in the circumstances.

It may be nothing more than an extension of their psychological warfare. We have no intelligence indicating plotting or defections within the armed forces or gearing up of Constitutionalist elements for a return to violent tactics. I am puzzled and uneasy, nevertheless. The Embassy is following developments most carefully.” <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> concluded: “One way of giving moral support to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>—and warning his adversaries—is for the President to send him warm New Year Greetings.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Dominican Republic, Vol. XVIII)</note>

                        <p>Summary</p>
                        <p>Relative political stability achieved by <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> administration during first 18 months in office now coming under stepped-up pressure as result convergence political, economic and other factors. Further radicalization of public and private posture of <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> as leading opposition party appears clearly underway. Emergence of Wessin and <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss> as new anti-Communist alternative to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> complicates political scene in negative sense and at least calls into question firmness and continuity of support in some sectors heretofore solidly committed to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. Increased militancy (perhaps born of frustration) of extreme left seems to pose threat of renewed violence if and when “target of opportunity” situation occurs, or can be developed. Political timetable during first half 1968 offers enough prospective such situations to warrant concern. In face of all this, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> appears confident he can weather anticipated storms by using essentially same methods and tactics as have characterized his administration to date. While we are less sanguine now than heretofore that he is fully on top of situation and all its diverse aspects, we continue give him better than even chance of survival through May 1968 election. Our strong continued support, always publicly demonstrated, is essential to this outcome. End summary.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                                <p>A. Three weeks hence <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> administration will have been in office longer than any Dominican regime since Trujillo assassination. Despite its numerous faults and chaotic situation it inherited, present <gloss target="#t_GODR1">GODR</gloss> has provided country with greater measure stability and at least better prospect economic progress (although as of yet negligible social and political progress) than any of its post Trujillo predecessors. It has rekindled hopes of many Dominicans (and others) that there may be, after all, a constitutional solution to Dominican problem.</p>
                                <p>B. Stability, however—always relative here—is achieved and maintained only through constant attention to delicate equilibrium of forces and through keeping opposition (real and potential) as divided <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0532"/>and off-balance as possible. Although he seems be finding it increasingly difficult to do so, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has so far been able perform both feats successfully and has concurrently been able instill in nation as whole a sense of accomplishment, meager though it may be, beyond expectations of most a short 18 months ago.</p>
                                <p>C. Two major elements of political scene have displayed constant and ever-increasing inability to reconcile themselves either to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> or to being out of power. These opposition elements are, of course: former Constitutionalists, with emphasis on Communists and <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> radicals but including many IRD moderates and numerous Social Christians; and intransigent right wingers, opportunists and others now lumped into or sympathetic to Wessinista <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>. Unfortunately, their frustration has been heightened, rather than lessened, by <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs operation and staffing of his govt and his apparent public insensitivity to very real social problems affecting nation. At this time hard-core Constitutionalists and hard-core “Wessinistas” are seeking seriously undermine if not eventually overthrow <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. Their chances of success in latter endeavor would depend, inter alia, on degree of cohesiveness they possess or can develop within themselves, degree of unity of purpose they can achieve, both internally and with each other, and amount of outside support, i.e., military, Havana (and to a significantly lesser degree Cuban exiles operating with forces of the right) they can draw upon, all available evidence indicates that, at this time, they lack, singly or in any combination, those essential ingredients of success.</p>

Communists, while still split and squabbling, are nonetheless trying to increase their trouble-making potential and their initially most effective force, i.e. 14th June, may have strengthened its ties with Havana. All of these elements are, at least to minor degree, already inter-related. Some <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> members and Communists have on instructions infiltrated <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] has had indications in recent months of stepped-up infiltration by Communists of <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, particularly at neighborhood levels in Santo Domingo, where there has been evidence of some infusion of 14th June elements. Some Golpista-inclined elements of <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss> have been discussing coup possibilities with <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and other elements, and there has been evidence of other contact between <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> elements in an unknown context. Caamano may now be shared by <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>

Oppositionʼs growing, though still limited, potential will, of course, feed on unrest but will make relatively little headway towards ultimate goal of at least some of its sectors, i.e., <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs overthrow, so long as bulk of businessmen, Partido Reformista and, most importantly, armed forces, remain united and behind President. Some erosion these major sectors Presidentʼs support has already occurred, particularly toward <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>, though not to significant degree. Next few months, with their potential for unrest heightened by three-month municipal election campaign scheduled begin February 16, could well produce significant growth of oppositionʼs potential and increased erosion Presidentʼs support.</item>

                                <p>A. Particularly in view <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>ʼs probable participation therein, election campaign will bring into open latent hostilities of revolution which remain just barely below surface and provide occasion for possibly serious disturbances. Even should <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> not participate in elections, which not presently certain, it could be fully counted upon to wage vigorous “non-campaign” in pursuit its own interests. Communists are likely to try to join in with harassment of campaigners as they did in 66 elections. Such activities could invite “repression” of left both by authorities and by <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss> (and possibly <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>) affiliated “vigilantes” and could create atmosphere propitious for inflating ranks of left-wing radicals and extremists and for simulating greater cohesion between these elements of left.</p>
                                <p>B. To right, including many Reformistas, businessmen, and military elements, such eventualities would in turn translate into visible growth of “Communist threat” and result in heavier pressures on <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to deal with it summarily. Should he not respond satisfactorily, he would run increased risk of losing significant elements of business community and military to <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>, whose attraction for them lies in part in fact it offers Wessin as an acceptable alternative to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> should Pres prove conclusively (to them) that he “soft on communism.”</p>
                                <p>C. All this, of course, is without reference to any specific plans Communists may have in mind for guerilla actions and/or urban terrorism, to possible <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> plans for “popular uprising”, or to <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss> plans for coup attempt. While we have yet to develop hard evidence that any such effort is likely to occur in near future, it is clear that at least some elements of each of three above sectors are actively considering action along lines indicated. In addition, there are two external factors that could trip delicate balance against <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and force him to assume increasingly defensive and authoritarian positions, and make him prey to more and more wolves. For our purposes these factors, both unknown, <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0534"/>are (a) those of the conceivable developments in Haiti which would impact adversely here, and (b) just how <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> (or entire island) fits into Cuban plans.</p>

Notwithstanding real possibility of major trouble and some erosion of his support between now and scheduled May 16 elections, we continue estimate of his survivability would necessarily have to be reviewed and reassessed however if, in treading delicate tight rope between now and then, he should make any serious missteps such as miscalculation under pressure of some key issue or of balance of forces and should take action net effect of which would be to alienate significant support or sharply intensify opposition, or if he were to be dealt with unfairly by elements beyond his control, e.g. his own incapacitation, successful exploitation by his opponents of any Communist effort in Haiti, or a major Castro-backed effort against him.</p>

We also hypothesized that “any movement against the govt in which <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> engaged in foreseeable future would, because of its present isolation from moderate sectors, have to be undertaken in concert with long-discredited elements of military and right, or with extreme left, or with a combination of the two.” Intelligence developed since then, and particularly since last Sep, indicates a disquieting but as yet not precisely measurable degree of cross-fertilization between <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>, and Communists.</item>

                                    <item>We hold to our working hypothesis as the most plausible explanation of <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> actions and statements and estimate that <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> is once again attempting maneuver events so as to create situation favorable to eventual realization of its ambitions. In this it is unfortunately being provided an opening by <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and elements of his administration, most notoriously some elements of the police, whose continued <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0535"/>“repression” of opposition elements, however justified its action may be in some instances, is providing ammunition to opposition. <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>ʼs first attempt manipulate events to its hypothesized ultimate ends took place last May when political temperature had almost reached boiling point after terrorism that capped six weeks of rising political tension following assassination attempt against <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Imbert</persName>.

Which in many respects is an echo of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs “return to constitutionality without elections” of 1964–65. In fact, later slogan in which “constitutionality” refers to 63 Constitution, is being given renewed currency today by partyʼs continuing denial of constitutional character to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> administration, its executive committeeʼs posture on electoral abstention, the growing threat of its legislative blocʼs permanent withdrawal, and its first official invocation of 63 Constitution as basis for party position (as evidenced in its Jan 3 letter to Emb and in Jan 5 broadcast by Pena Gomez, who stated <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intervened in 65 primarily to prevent return to constitutionality of 63, and that since <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> still holds to that constitution “it natural” that party would face intervention again should there develop another chance to apply that constitutionʼs tenets).</item>

Its unusual musical offerings on Christmas Eve (Constitutionalist hymn and Marseillaise) and New Yearʼs Eve (marching song of DOM youths who trained in Cuba prior to Jun 14, 59 invasion effort against Trujillo), all three of which repeated in Jan 6 broadcast, its almost constant public reference to coming “redemption” and “liberation,” its absolute silence on <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamano</persName>, its now constant and uniformly contemptuous (and often vicious) personal attacks on <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, its efforts persuade its audience that present situation on “total repression” of peopleʼs hopes and aspirations mirrors or surpasses that <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0536"/>of early 65, and its constant reiteration of friendship for military and particularly AF.

Moscow-oriented <gloss target="#t_PCD1">PCD</gloss> has, for the first time known to Embassy, resorted to training guerilla warfare cadres; three such groups of 12–16 personnel each have been identified recently; two were located in Haitian border regions and one in countryʼs northern tier. At least this would seem to indicate that since most recent tricontinental conference <gloss target="#t_PCD1">PCD</gloss> has moved toward Havana outlook on revolutionary activity, or, at most, that Dominican Republic may be considered a unique situation by Havana–Moscow axis in which some measure of agreement has been reached by them on its guerilla potential. In either event, these indications signal more extreme posture on the part of the <gloss target="#t_PCD1">PCD</gloss> and distinct departure from “pragmatic” approach to which it has adhered in past. 14th June and <gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss> are being rent by internal dissensions, with <gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss> in a more advance stage than 14th. Both have encountered ample frustrations in attempting to organize over past months for insurgency effort predicated on more classic approach of Campesino support. They have found that Campesinos do not easily abandon their traditional conservatism; that internal security forces operating throughout interior represent formidable obstacle to clandestine activity of this nature; and that, all aspects considered, this is form of long range endeavor which they are unable to sustain under pressure of their own internal divisions and of government. As their frustrations in these respects have become more pronounced, there has been resultant tendency to look to irrational, quick solutions through process of escalating competition among not only factions in each party but between parties themselves in order prove themselves as most dedicated Marxist-Leninist.</item>

According to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] reports, Cubans invited 14th June to send group of ex-Constitutionalist leaders to Cuba for training in late September and, month and a half later, provided financial support for formation of new ex-Constitutionalist organization for purpose of participating in “armed struggle.” It is suggestive or even perhaps significant that M24A was resurrected shortly thereafter with public announcement made by two ex-Constitutionalists with 14th June backgrounds. Its efforts have to this point been devoted to organizing affiliates in interior and, if it has any particular political cast, based on presently-known personnel affiliations it is 14th June.</item>

                                    <item>Communist Parties are at present in no position embark on insurgency course with hopes of eventual success unless there is reasonable prospect for outside support and assistance in form of either parallel or cooperative endeavors from other political quarters. Critical factor here is <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>ʼs attitude toward this form of collaboration and, to lesser extent, that of <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>. If <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> is prone to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> at earliest opportunity, <gloss target="#t_PCD1">PCD</gloss>ʼs recent activities and frustrated and irrational mood of <gloss target="#t_MPD1">MPD</gloss> and MR1J4 would make them all likely participants if not spearhead of such an effort. There is insufficient evidence upon which to base any estimate of what role might be destined for Caamano.

                                <p>Wessinʼs <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss> is essentially loose agglomeration of those outside of left who traditionally opposed to or more recently dissatisfied with <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. In addition to many of those who followed Bonnelly (who obtained 45,000 votes) in 1966 election campaign, <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>ers include numerous UCNers who voted for <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, many disenchanted Reformistas (according to Vice President Lora and other high <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> officials), and unknown number <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and 14th June members. Bulk of latter elements, however, some of whom have joined <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss> on instructions their respective parties, are presumably there for protective, tactical or some other non-Wessinista reason. <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>ʼs surprisingly fast growth derived from fact that in Wessin it provided anti-Communist and otherwise acceptable alternative to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to those who previously had no non-leftist alternative to him. Recent [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] information has provided evidence of a split between Golpista and electoral-minded elements in <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>. Wessinʼs significance lies hardly as much in his electoral potential however as in fairly substantial sympathies he retains in military and in his potential for increased attractiveness <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0538"/>to military and business community, some of whose elements are believed be contributing financially to <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>.

While playing this risky game of survival (which he has so far had to play less than any predecessor except <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, who did not play at all), he has (as did <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>) deliberately ignored his own party, has not built base of support within government, and has not deemed it necessary to bridge gap between military, business community (i.e., power sectors) and unorganized “sane popular majorities” which together he constantly gives public and private impression are his sole pillars of support.

Unfortunately, there seems to be no way (and we and others have tried many times ways) to convince him that political organizations do in fact represent large segments of same people whose interest he believes he so zealously safeguarding. And he is safeguarding them, he believes with highly ingrained paternalistic bias, by protecting them from malevolent designs of “agitators” and “Communists” (with security forces) and improving overall economic situation (via business community) from which all people will eventually benefit. In seeking paternalistically provide peace and progress for peopleʼs future, however, he does not seem by instinct or temperament inclined adequately or consistently to recognize basic political necessity of satisfying their psychological needs of present, a failure that opposition more than avidly exploits.</item>

                                    <item>Manner and style which Pres runs his administration, never plusses for him, have increasingly become negative factors. It is an “old” govt in terms both of age of most of its leading figures (many of them hacks and throwbacks to earlier era) and of its general approach toward conduct of public business. Concentration of all authority over even minute detail in Pres personally, corresponding relegation Cabinet members (most of whom have not slightest idea what modern govt is about) to mere figureheads unwilling and incapable making routine decisions because they fear Presʼs wrath or have not merest idea his thinking, practically total lack of elementary staff work, consequent readiness by Pres to make ad hoc decisions in vacuum or on basis information or opinion always incomplete and often biased or self-serving, Pres innate distrust “technicians”—his tolerance of notorious crooks in his circle—all of these add greatly to burdens of our own operations here, particularly in aid field, but more importantly they have meant that govt as a whole has over the months failed generate any real degree popular enthusiasm and has fallen prey to secular cynicism of average DOM toward any govt. Up to now, Pres himself has been generally excepted from this popular cynicism. Usual formulation, outside more rabid sectors of opposition on left and right, has been that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is good, honest, sincere, hardworking man trying to do his best but victimized by a bunch of fools, scoundrels and thieves. This judgment, in both respects, is close to the mark. One of most frustrating—and dangerous—aspects this unhappy administrative situation is that Pres gives every sign to us of realizing incompetence and dishonesty some of his closest associates, yet for many reasons which, at least to us, do not seem persuasive, does almost nothing about it, [garble—thereby incurring?] risk increasingly of losing <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0540"/>his present general immunity from direct attack and worsening his already difficult situation.</item>

                                    <item>Another factor greatly colors Presʼs view of <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>. Pres firmly believes <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and his more rabid followers are sworn enemies of both <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> as <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> working for it to be, (and of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> with which Pres strongly identifies). He has therefore long since set himself out to destroy <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> before <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> can destroy him. His fear of Communist threat is directly related to this struggle, as he believes <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, Pena Gomez et al either Communist or next thing to it. To fight Communists, protect “sane majorities” and provide business with investment climate, Pres looks ultimately (and increasingly, as threats to him increase) to military.

                                    <item>Threat, however, keeps growing and is fed by his acts of omission and commission and words and those of many of his subordinates and adherents. To <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and Communists (and to <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>) Pres has in past two weeks, for instance, offered grave challenge and variety legitimately exploitable issues. He has catered primarily to military (promotions and decorations) to business, military and right in general (industrial exposition speech); and to “sane majorities” (above and Christmas and New Years’ msgs). During same time he has given opposition nothing but issues (cut in Christmas bonus, maintenance of cut in university budget, extra-ordinary military promotion ceremony, series mostly deporable or unpalatably political govt-mental personnel shifts and appointments and, most importantly, apparently gratuitous statement of DOM dependence on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> with special emphasis on alleged <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> determination prevent another Communist takeover in Caribbean or, in effect, another revolution like that of 65).</item>

                                    <item>Presʼs recent actions seem to us unnecessarily provocative to considerable range of opponents. Although we can only speculate, these actions could reflect: (1) diminished presidential sense of proportion and perspective; (2) a presidential assessment considerably different from our own as to power balance of moment and action requirements deriving therefrom; or (3) presidential intent to provoke a direct confrontation and showdown with opposition on timing and issues of his choosing.</item>

                            <item>We unfortunately cannot rely Pres to level completely with us as to what he is up to, if he is in fact operating along final line suggested above. Aside from his normal taciturnity on matters involving such important internal questions, we convinced he would not explain himself to us candidly for fear we would raise serious objections, as we quite probably would. In any event Presʼs success in this possible endeavor or in meeting situation stimulated otherwise depends in great measure on military, as he himself fully recognizes.</item>

                                    <item>Three high military officers have acknowledged to EmbOff in last six weeks that fair amount Wessinista sentiment exists throughout ranks of military and particularly among former CEFA personnel and in air force. Deputy Army <gloss target="#t_CS1">C/S</gloss>, however, stated this sentiment is held on individual rather than sectoral basis and that, with possible exceptions of smaller air force units, there cannot be considered to be Wessinista “segments” in armed forces. Same officers also acknowledged “Constitutionalist” sentiment in military, but they consider this negligible. On other hand, another of these officers, Col Nivar Seijas, has said that among his precautions against some eventuality he has “ringed” officers of some units, whose loyalty to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> he suspects, with trusted sergeants so as to prevent implementation of anti-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> orders these suspect officers may issue or, if necessary, to arrest or kill them. It is possible that Wessinista and/or Constitutionalist-oriented military elements may have made similar arrangements. Above officers, as well as [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] DAO sources and contacts, generally agree, however, that military as whole remains responsive to its high command and to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>.</item>

                                    <item>President has recently taken two significant steps to reinforce this responsiveness and to diminish or at least prevent further growth of Wessinista sentiment. These were his Dec 24 promotion ceremony for 765 essentials lower and middle grade military men, about two-thirds of whom enlisted personnel and over half of whom air force, and his decoration on Jan 5 of 217 navy and 475 army officers, also mostly lower and middle grade.

                                    <item>In light leftist maneuverings detailed above, unusual drama of Presidentʼs promotion ceremony and his large promotion and decoration lists, which sandwiched ringing anti-Communist “incentive” speech to business community (and military), convey impression that by appeasing power sectors he is attempting erode Wessinista real and potential strength and at same time consolidate his strength in order to meet what he would appear now to consider more immediate threat of major leftist actions, to deal with this contingency with maximum dispatch and with minimum violence, he knows he must have united and effective military support.</item>

Should eventual resolution this controversy prove decidedly unpalatable to one side or other, it possible that some erosion could <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0542"/>take place, although it unlikely it would be of significant proportions as long as leftist threat persists. Should <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> not take steps considered adequate by military to meet this threat, however, it is likely that elements therein would turn more and more to Wessin as alternative.

It was noted that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> was not interested in building and maintaining the organization of his Reformist Party and until he responded to U.S. efforts to “vitalize him” there was not much the United States could do. “<persName corresp="#p_SRM1">Sayre</persName> expressed his concern that in March or April, when it would be too late, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would suddenly awaken to the fact that his own prestige was involved in the municipal elections and would turn to us with demands that we do something.” (Memorandum from Trueheart to <persName corresp="#p_HTL1">Hughes</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGCJ1">Denney</persName>, January 18; Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INRIL1">INR/IL</gloss> Historical Files, Dominican Republic 1968)</note>

                        <p>The possibility exists that the Dominican Revolutionary Party (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>) may not participate in the 16 May 1968 municipal elections, thereby depriving <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> of the important psychological factor of a major, left of center opposition. It is, therefore, important that the other left of center opposition party, the Revolutionary Social Christian Party (<gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>), participate effectively in the municipal elections and provide an outlet for left of center sentiment.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum asks the 303 Committee to approve a proposal for a modest covert contribution [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] to the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> for its municipal election activities.</p>

The applicable general U.S. objective is the “creation of the infrastructure to support a viable, democratic political system in the Dominican Republic”. The Specific U.S. Objectives cited in the CASP and applicable to this proposal are to “maintain and strengthen the Social Christians in a position of constructive opposition”, and to “prevent an alliance of the right or the extreme right and the left or the extreme left against the government”.</p>

Seventy <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0548"/>seven mayoralty positions and 417 council seats are to be contested. It currently appears that President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Joaquin Balaguer</persName> will face mounting opposition efforts to create political unrest during the period leading up to and through the elections. It is believed important that the municipal elections give the populace confidence in the electoral process even in the face of the existing political problems; they should provide the electorate a legitimate choice and demonstrate that a responsible opposition party can campaign in the Dominican Republic. This would have a favorable and reassuring psychological impact.</item>

Although there is some risk that the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> government would be annoyed should it learn that the U.S. contributed to a rival party without its knowledge, it is believed that this would only cause a temporary strain since the government itself has been encouraging the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> to continue in a constructive opposition role.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Part I—Statement of Rationale and Basic Strategy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The future course of the Dominican Republic continues to be of great importance to the United States for three inter-related reasons:(a) its strategic location on our geographic doorstep and very close to Communist Cuba; (b) the primitiveness and fragility of its political, economic, social and military institutions, which make for chronic instability and consequent vulnerability to extremism; and (c) the serious damage to our interests in case of the assumption of power in another Caribbean country by forces inimical to us.</p>
                        <p>Four centuries of political, economic and social underdevelopment, thirty years of corrosive dictatorship, and six years of political turbulence and instability had by the start of the present administration produced a nation and a people uncertain of themselves and their future, erratically searching for a national identity and character while yearning for an equitable society with representative, responsive political institutions, and the economic, political, social advances and peace they associate with them. Political factors, demographic developments, economic and social inequities and proximity to Cuba have <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0551"/>contributed to a chronic ferment on the national scene with youth perhaps the most volatile element. By mid 1968, halfway through the term in office of the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> Administration, it is clear that despite modest progress, the problems of political stability, social justice, and economic development are still far from solved.</p>
                        <p>The United States has a vital interest in denying this Caribbean nation to communism including the Cuban variant. Related thereto is the necessity to prevent a regression into authoritarianism of the right, with its almost certain consequence, in the Dominican environment, of enhancing communist prospects. Any long-term success in this regard must necessarily entail far-reaching economic, social and military reforms and the creation and strengthening of indigenous institutions which today lack the capability to assure stability and progress or to strengthen the nation against domestic or foreign subversion. From the standpoint of the inter-American system, it is important that the Dominican Republic be strengthened to function as an independent, fully sovereign and responsible member of the international community.</p>
                        <p>Circumstances of geography and history—but only secondarily economics—have deeply involved the United States in developments in the Dominican Republic. Many factors favor our exercising a significant influence. The first is our very proximity, which predisposes many Dominicans to accept as inevitable a very important U.S. role. A second is the critical need for our economic and technical assistance. A third is a combination of the first two: the unusually developed tendency of many Dominicans in all walks of life to view the United States as the arbiter of their nationʼs destinies, for good or for evil. It is easy and dangerous, however, to overestimate the extent to which even a powerful nation can today work its will on a weak neighbor. The recent history of U.S. involvement in this country has emphasized certain inherent limitations on the exercise of our influence. First, there are the restraints placed on U.S. policies and actions by a decent regard for domestic and international opinion and by the ultimate ability of the Dominicans to have recourse to international organizations against real or alleged abuses of our influence. Second, the degree to which our prestige has become committed here is in itself an element which Dominicans, in and out of power, can use to resist our influence in matters in which our interests diverge because they realize the restricted alternatives we have under present circumstances. Underlying these other limitations on our influence is the basic, persistent fact of the essential primitivism of Dominican society, politics and institutions which often vitiates, distorts or frustrates our inputs, be they political, economic, social or military. Our very special importance in the Dominican Republic gives us an uncommon ability and opportunity to counsel, persuade and guide; it does not give us the power to command.</p>
                        <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0552"/>
                        <p>Following the revolution of April 1965, our immediate objective had to be the restoration of order in the Dominican Republic and a return to legally elected constitutional government and, with this accomplished, the maintenance of sufficient political stability and economic and social progress to enable the Government to carry out its mandate. Over the long run, we seek to promote the existence in the Dominican Republic of representative, responsive and reform-minded governments, operating from a sound economic, social and military base, friendly and disposed to cooperate with us on vital issues in international forums. In moving toward that objective, we seek a citizenry better informed about, and prepared to construct and support, democratic institutions and an equitable society based upon the rule of law and concern as well as respect for the rights of others. As an indispensable concomitant, we seek the growth, strengthening and rationalization of the Dominican economy, as well as a balance-of-payments equilibrium so that domestic and foreign resources can be most effectively utilized in a comprehensive and effective program of economic and social development and reform, which will assure meaningful and tangible progress toward the correction of prevailing inequities. Finally, we seek a small, professional, apolitical security establishment which acts as a positive, rather than, as in the past, a negative force in the political, economic and social development of the country.</p>
                        <p>Our over-all strategy to accomplish these objectives inevitably engages us in most aspects of Dominican national life. We are utilizing very substantial financial and technical assistance and encouraging appropriate domestic and foreign investment in order first to stabilize and then develop the Dominican economy along modern lines and to stimulate and accelerate social reforms. As part of this effort we are trying to raise the low average effectiveness of human resources and of the countryʼs institutions. We support and emphasize publicly and privately the concept of legal, constitutional government, the indispensability of basic economic and social changes, and the democratic process. Through material and technical assistance, training and indoctrination we work toward a security force effective, compatible with the countryʼs needs, responsive to civil authority, apolitical, and ready to perform a positive supporting role in the countryʼs progress. Finally, we employ these multiple U.S. inputs so as to persuade the Dominican Government and people to commit themselves and their own resources in a manner permitting long-run, self-sustaining economic, social and political development while avoiding resort to violence and disorder.</p>
                        <p>The broad policies which flow from this strategy are producing some progress toward our principal goals. While this progress, when measured against the situation two years ago, is encouraging, our policies <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0553"/>cannot be said yet to have resolved any of the countryʼs basic problems. As of mid–1968, a considerable degree of political stability exists, but it is not firmly established and its continuation is far from certain. Our economic assistance has contributed to that stability, but it has had as yet little impact upon the problem of massive unemployment, and, notwithstanding some hopeful investment and production trends, it has been able to bring about only minimal economic growth and financial equilibrium. Nor has it yet produced more than modest social advances. The failure to achieve any significant per capita growth in 1967 is of serious concern, and continuation of this stagnation is unacceptable. The time has come to begin to move the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> toward the minimum target growth rate of 2.5% per capita set for the Alliance for Progress and to make it less dependent on the United States. In the FY 1970 Program Memorandum the Country Team will submit recommendations for an assistance program designed to achieve these goals. Pending consideration of these recommendations the present policy of providing only the minimum assistance needed to avoid serious balance of payments and political crisis should be continued.</p>

                        <p>On May 15, 1968, municipal elections were held in the Dominican Republic. Over 1 million people turned out to vote for candidates in 77 municipalities, 200,000 more than the Embassy had estimated. With the abstention of the left of center Partido Revolucionario Dominicano(<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>) and other important right of center parties, it was expected that President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs Party, the Partido Reformista (<gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>), would win a majority of the votes. Of the 77 municipalities, Partido Reformista won 66 including Santo Domingo. The left of center Partido Revolucionario Social Christiano (<gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>) won 2 municipalities and the approximately 45 local independent political movements won 9.</p>

                        <p>You authorized special sugar allocations to the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> in 1966 (123,020 tons) and 1967 (105,000 tons). <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> still needs additional support and has asked for it again this year. In recommending a special allocation, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> proposes to continue the weaning process by cutting the level back 30,000 tons over last year. But this reduction will not materially affect the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> overall quota as compared with what it received in 1967. Higher <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> consumption and a larger deficit in the Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands quotas will bring increases in the amount received by the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> under the regular pro rata system.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> continues to make good use of the additional help. Other sugar producers have not complained about the special treatment and are not likely to do so since we are progressively decreasing the special allocation. You have authority in the Sugar Act to make special allocations, and the legislative history singles out the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> as needing help.</p>

                            <item>The covert passage of funds to the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> had its desired effect.

While the psychological impact on Dominican voters of the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> decision to participate in the elections would be difficult to evaluate with precision, it undoubtedly made a significant contribution, along with other factors, in inducing a highly encouraging voter turn-out of 1,028,410 on election day—a figure which compares very favorably with the 1,354,404 persons who voted in the more hotly contested and more significant presidential elections of 1966. By its participation in the electoral contest, the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> also enhanced its image as the “loyal opposition,” garnering more than 124,000 votes—a fourfold increase over its showing in the 1966 elections.

                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since his inauguration in July 1966, President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has presided over the longest period of political stability since Trujilloʼs 31year dictatorship ended in 1961. In doing so, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has maintained a broad range of political freedoms, only occasionally resorting to arbitrary methods. His survival in office has perhaps been <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs major accomplishment and has given many Dominicans hope that a relatively democratic government can provide stability, order, and a measure of economic progress.</p>
                        <p>This accomplishment is impressive by Dominican standards, but <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> nonetheless has so far been unable to create the political conditions that will ensure long-term stability. He has failed to promote the development of political institutions such as Congress, the <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0557"/>judiciary, labor unions, and political parties that could provide a force for constitutional stability. The Trujillo period and its turbulent aftermath created hatreds and animosities that are still major political burdens. Intransigent opponents, unable to reconcile themselves to being out of power, continue looking for an opening to topple the government. Although the countryʼs economic prospect is somewhat improved, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has not given high priority to politically difficult but essential economic, social, and military reforms. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid is still vital to financial stability and even a moderate rate of economic growth.</p>
                        <p>During the last half of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs term, political activity will increasingly focus on presidential elections to be held in mid–1970. Pre-electoral maneuvering seems likely to bring latent political conflicts to the surface, and it is not at all certain that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs successor—assuming the President does not run again—will be able to move into the presidency in a stable political environment. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs major challenge during the next two years, therefore, will be to establish the conditions needed to demonstrate that his administration is more than an interregnum between periods of chaos and instability.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs Strengths …</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has been able to maintain the backing—or at least the tacit acceptance—of most of the political sectors that supported his candidacy in the 1966 elections. His generally conservative and cautious policies have avoided alienating the military and the politically influential upper and upper-middle class. In addition, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support, made manifest through conspicuous political actions and a major infusion of economic aid, has served to bolster the President and discourage his opponents.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> continues to profit from the reaction of the majority of the Dominican political community to the violence and instability of the 1965 “constitutionalist” uprising. Most Dominicans have accepted <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs overwhelming electoral victory in 1966 over <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName> as a popular mandate for peace and order. Although <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has failed to generate strong popular enthusiasm, his performance has generally been accepted and no major challenges to his rule have developed. He has retained and expanded his support among moderates, the church, and business elements, and the victory of his Reformist Party in the municipal elections last May was on the whole an endorsement of the President.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has generally proved to be an astute political tactician with a sound understanding of Dominican political psychology. He has employed a variety of political stratagems to maintain and broaden his support while keeping his opponents off balance. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has been conscious that most Dominicans respect dominant—at times even authoritarian—leadership. Operating on this assumption, he has issued <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0558"/>veiled warnings to political adventurers and has used government power in a forceful and at times unrestrained manner to harass and intimidate dissidents. He has kept the left and right from uniting against him and has sought to stimulate divisions in each sector. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has attempted to give his government an image of “national unity” by appointing to government positions a broad spectrum of politicians ranging from right-wing to center left. In so doing, he has bought off some opponents and has exiled potential troublemakers to overseas diplomatic posts.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">… And His Weaknesses</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs performance as President has not been without serious negative aspects that have been exploited by his opposition. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs style of governing bears many of the hallmarks of Trujillo, in whose government he served for many years. In addition, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is so strongly influenced by the traditionalism and primitive nature of the Dominican political environment that he tends to be insensitive to the need for change and modernization.</p>
                        <p>5. Many of his supporters display political thinking shaped under Trujillo and are considerably more authoritarian and conservative in outlook—as well as much less honest—than <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. Out of loyalty and an inability to place his faith in others, however, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has put many of these partisans into influential advisory posts and important positions in the security services. The presence of these “trujillistas”—as they are labeled by their enemies—and their occasional arbitrary behavior have served as a constant goad to those who opposed Trujillo and also have provided a ready source of political ammunition for the left and right. Of additional concern has been the increased interest the Trujillo clan has shown from exile in Europe over the last year in Dominican politics and in maintaining ties with some Dominican politicians.</p>
                        <p>6. Many leaders of the Reformist Party (<gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>), including Vice President Lora, have been seriously disenchanted by the Presidentʼs failure to build up the party through government patronage and funds. They are also critical of some of his policies and resentful of their lack of influence in shaping them. The combination of the <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>, which appears to have strengthened its grass-roots organization despite the Presidentʼs indifference, and “trujillista” government officials provides a potential danger to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and may prove difficult for a moderate successor to dislodge.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs administrative style and government appointments have not been a source of strength to his administration. By and large he has appointed aides on the basis of politics and old friendships. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs undistinguished appointments and his tendency to centralize authority in his office have weakened the already inadequately staffed <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0559"/>government ministries, forcing the President to take on the almost impossible task of overseeing even minor policy decisions to ensure their execution. His subordinates, in turn, buck even trivial matters up to the President for a decision. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs failure to give adequate guidelines to the actions of the police and the palace intelligence staff has been especially damaging politically and has been effectively exploited by the opposition. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs governing style consequently has produced a more conservative image of his government than is warranted by the Presidentʼs own political values.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has proved to be relatively insensitive to public opinion, has displayed a distrust of the press, and has often dismissed even well-intentioned criticism as malicious and politically inspired. Reflecting the Dominican predilection for the politics of annihilation rather than compromise and conciliation, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has frequently reacted to opposition attacks by stimulating unnecessary antagonism. One of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs most damaging blind spots has been his slow realization that the appearance of government “repression” and “terrorism” upset many moderates and gave credibility to opposition charges of “neo-trujilloism.”</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">The Intransigent Opposition</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has had to expend considerable effort to stay one step ahead of the elements on the left and right who have been unable to reconcile themselves to his assumption of power and who have been antagonized by his manner of rule. The left and the right have issued a continuing stream of hostile and frequently inflammatory propaganda that has kept political tensions high. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs opponents, however, have been unable to form a common front. The divisions between them have remained deeper than their hostility to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Dominican Revolutionary Party</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. During most of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs term the Dominican Revolutionary Party (<gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>), dominated by its more radical elements, has maintained a militant position of “revolutionary and nationalistic” opposition to the President. It has accused him of “neo-Trujillo” practices and “systematic repression” of his opponents, and has stridently criticized <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support of his government. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> has issued frequent warnings that unless <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> adopts a more acceptable course, it will be in the vanguard of the “inevitable revolution.” Early this month, one <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> leader seemed to go even further toward radicalization, saying that the partyʼs goal is “a struggle of national liberation in order to achieve revolutionary power by any means.”</p>
                        <p>11. Despite its posturing, the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> has not—as many <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> supporters believe—engaged in serious conspiracy or made efforts to organize a popular uprising. The party has, however, kept in contact with <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0560"/>Communist and right-wing opponents of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to discern their strength and intentions. Prior to the election in May 1968, the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> seemed on the verge of cooperating with the extremist Dominican Popular Movement in a campaign of violence to press voters into complying with the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> strategy of electoral abstention. At the last minute, however, the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> leadership—under pressure of more moderate party elements—pulled back and only minor violence occurred.</p>
                        <p>12. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> has based its policies in part on the conviction that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> would eventually succumb to a right-wing military takeover. In addition, the partyʼs efforts to discredit <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and to maintain an atmosphere of political tension seem at times to have been aimed at encouraging others to conspire. The activities of party elder statesman <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>—who remains in self-imposed exile in Europe—have also pushed the party into a more radical and more anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> position.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs efforts to isolate and discredit the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and undermine its support among organized labor and the government bureaucracy have also encouraged radicalism. Despite a few half-hearted efforts he has made to reach some sort of accommodation with the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has said that its leaders “are little more than Communists.”</p>
                        <p>14. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> probably realizes that present conditions differ considerably from those existing in 1965, when it had the support of some military elements in toppling a very unpopular and narrowly based government. The gradual erosion of the partyʼs popular support and the deterioration of its organization have limited its capability for antigovernment action. In addition, a significant current of relatively moderate <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> opinion resents the influence of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>, is unwilling to renounce democratic methods for <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs authoritarian and radical notions of “popular dictatorship,” and dislikes the idea of breaking all links to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. The “moderates” have served as a brake on the radical leadership and have frequently forced Party Secretary General Jose Francisco Pena Gomez to pull back from extreme positions.</p>
                        <p>15. Over the next few months the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> will have to begin to define its position in regard to the 1970 elections. If the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> is to remain a significant Dominican political force and avoid further radicalization, it must moderate its line, develop constructive alternatives to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs policies, and find a popular candidate. At present the party seems uncertain of its course and has adopted a wait-and-see attitude, at least until the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> political picture becomes clearer. Despite his angry denunciations of “<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interventionism,” <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> leader Pena has said that future <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policies toward the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> will determine whether the Dominican Republic enjoys a “peaceful transition” in 1970 or whether “we will have a violent revolution.” The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> evidently hopes that a new <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> administration will be less committed to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0561"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">The Extreme Left</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>16. Dominican Communists have steadily lost ground under the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> administration as a result of an intensification of ideological and tactical factionalism and intensive government harassment. The total membership of the countryʼs three “major” and three minor extreme leftist groupings appears to have declined from about 1,000 in late 1966 to an estimated 800. Communist activity has been limited to anti-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> propagandizing and sporadic, relatively ineffective violence and terrorism. Although the Dominican Popular Movement and the 14th of June Revolutionary Movement, both influenced by Cuban and Chinese doctrine, have stressed their intention to lay the groundwork for protracted guerrilla warfare, their efforts at promoting rural insurgency have been systematically and effectively disrupted by the security forces.</p>
                        <p>17. The extreme left remains influential among urban students, particularly in lower and middle-class neighborhoods in Santo Domingo, and at the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo UASD). Although <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has expressed deep concern over Communist influence on youth, he has been unable to develop an effective alternative appeal. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs show of force at the USAD in February 1968, however, demonstrated that he would not tolerate extremist-inspired violence among students.</p>
                        <p>18. The continued absence of “constitutionalist” leader <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Francisco Caamano</persName>, who mysteriously disappeared from his London military attaché assignment in October 1967 and apparently went to Cuba, has remained an unsettling influence. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> has disassociated itself in advance from any rash adventure by Caamano, and differences have developed among the Communists over supporting a possible Caamano-led and Cuban-backed attempt at insurgency. The widespread belief that Caamano has linked up with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> has discredited him among many Dominicans including dedicated “constitutionalists,” while <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs cancellation of Caamanoʼs military commission last May appears to have satisfied military pressure for action against their one-time colleague. Although the return of Caamano could serve to unify some of the Dominican extremist factions, it seems very unlikely that he could pose a major threat to the government.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">The Right</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>19. Although <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has devoted considerable effort to undermining the left, he has always believed that the major potential danger to his rule was posed by the right-wing and conservative elements who dominated the governing Council of State in 1962 and who pushed for the militaryʼs ouster of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> in 1963. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs suspicion of these elements have undoubtedly been heightened by their successful efforts to maneuver him out of power following the assassination of Trujillo <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0562"/>and by their sponsorship of the candidacy of Rafael Bonnelly in the 1966 presidential elections.</p>
                        <p>20. Many of these rightists have been frustrated by their inability to influence <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs policies and have sensed a threat to their own positions in the emergence of “trujillistas” in important government positions. They became particularly alarmed following the assassination attempt in March 1967 on <persName corresp="#p_IA1">Antonio Imbert</persName>—one of the two surviving members of the plot to assassinate Trujillo—which they blamed on elements in the government. The rightists, however, have remained unorganized and unable to reestablish their influence with the military. Indeed, some have even accepted government sinecures or remained benevolently neutral toward <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. In mid-May 1968, however, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> stirred up his opponents on the right with his threat to audit all government expenditures since Trujilloʼs assassination. This has intensified dislike of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> among rightists who profited handsomely from their government “service.”</p>
                        <p>21. The right gained a new ally in late 1967 with the formation of the Democratic Quisqueyan Party (<gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>). The immediate goal of the nationalistic and vehemently anti-Communist <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss> has been to mobilize public support to urge <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to permit the return from exile of General Wessin, the military leader who opposed the “constitutionalists” and who is now in Miami. Although <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss> leaders have asserted their fealty to constitutional government, many Dominicans fear the party will become a vehicle for anti-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> plotting.</p>
                        <p>22. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has said he will permit Wessin to return when political conditions are sufficiently stable and will allow him to be a candidate in the 1970 presidential elections. In the meantime, Wessin, frustrated over the ban on his entry, has become increasingly personal in his attacks on <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. Wessin has made some direct public appeals to the military for support for his cause but so far does not appear to have been very successful. The President reacted to these appeals in March 1968 when he placed restrictions on military contacts with politicians and his intelligence operatives have been successful in creating dissension within the <gloss target="#t_PQD1">PQD</gloss>.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Balaguer and the Military</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>23. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs ability to keep his opponents at bay has depended on his relationship with the armed forces—the key Dominican political interest group. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> entered office with the strong backing of the military, who deeply distrusted his leftist opponent, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> keeps a wary eye on military sentiments in making policy decisions and appears to have satisfied most officers that he will adhere to the national interest as they see it. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has been aided by a slowly growing apolitical spirit which is being nurtured in the military by the defense minister, Major General Perez.</p>
                        <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0563"/>
                        <p>24. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has retired or assigned overseas a number of officers whose past loyalties have been to Wessin or to civilian right-wingers, and he reorganized the military in September 1966 to break up the power of the armored unit Wessin once commanded. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, with the complete support of the military establishment, has systematically retired officers who joined the “constitutionalists” in 1965. Officers whom he trusts, such as the ambitious and opportunistic Colonel Nivar who commands troops in the capital area, have been moved into key posts. At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has maintained a delicate balance between antagonistic military factions, although Minister of Defense Perez and Nivar have frequently been at odds.</p>
                        <p>25. Military discontent appears to be of relatively minor significance and has not been focused on <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. Some officers have grumbled that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs tight purse strings restrict armed forces operating expenditures. Others have been irritated by <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs efforts to contain blatant military corruption. Some officers have complained that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is too lenient with the left—including the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and the Social Christians.</p>
                        <p>26. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has been reluctant to press a thorough going program of military reform for fear of possible political consequences. He has reduced military manpower by about seven percent and military expenditures by about 14 percent, but the 18,500–man military establishment remains larger than seems needed to maintain external and internal security. The military itself has resisted <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> efforts at streamlining, and foot dragging has hindered the effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> program.</p>
                        <p>27. There has been a gradual but steady improvement in the capabilities of the police, particularly after <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> appointed the relatively competent General <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Alvarez</persName> police chief in September 1967, and of the Department of National Investigations DNI), the governmentʼs formal intelligence service. The security forces still show a tendency to overreact, fail to sift rumors from fact, frequently fail to distinguish between the Communist and non-Communist left, and have an overzealous attitude toward the governmentʼs real and imagined opponents. Despite these shortcomings, they appear capable of overcoming any likely security threat as long as they remain politically united.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>28. President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs preoccupation with political stability, his emphasis on achieving financial stability, and his traditionalistic outlook have created drags on economic and social development efforts. Despite more than $100 million in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid during <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs first two years, at the end of 1967 the economy had not yet regained the peak level of 1964. With population growing at an annual rate of 3.5 percent, per capita income has probably shown a small decline <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0564"/>under <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. Both unemployment and underemployment remain high.</p>
                        <p>29. Although <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> recognizes the need for more rapid economic growth, his primary economic objective since taking office has been the restoration of domestic and international financial stability. His austerity program has trimmed noninvestment government expenditures and held total spending to a level that can be financed by domestic revenue and foreign aid. This conservative spending program has helped keep prices essentially stable, but has hampered economic recovery. Important steps have been taken to rationalize the operations of the state-owned industries—particularly the important state sugar corporation—and their financial position has considerably improved.</p>
                        <p>30. Government efforts have somewhat eased the countryʼs balance-of-payments problem. Exports have been diversified and expanded, and the increase in imports has been held down. Despite these promising developments, the countryʼs international payments position remains dependent on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance.</p>
                        <p>31. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has refrained from major economic policy changes that would involve substantial political risk. Although devaluation would help to hold down imports, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has avoided such action because of the probable outcry from importers and the Dominican conviction that the pesoʼs parity with the dollar is “sacred.” There has been some increase in tax collections, but the President has moved slowly in punishing tax evaders. Although the sale of government-owned industries would probably lead to better management, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> had demonstrated a sensitivity to the political criticism that would attend such a move.</p>
                        <p>32. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs style of administration has hampered economic development. The Presidentʼs centralization of authority in his office over even minor budget allocations, his failure to appoint competent officials, and his distrust of technicians and economic planning have imposed serious limitations on the governmentʼs ability to modernize and have had a detrimental effect on implementation of the the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid program. Many of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs personally selected investment projects have been designed more for political showmanship than for economic impact.</p>
                        <p>33. Despite these flaws, there are positive factors that offer some ground for optimism. Investment by private Dominicans and foreign businesses—which had been badly disrupted by the political chaos that preceded <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>—has shown increasing vigor, and gross private and government investment is up considerably. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-aided efforts at agricultural diversification, while not producing results quickly as originally hoped, are gradually strengthening this key sector. The apparent end of a serious year-long drought should also spur agricultural production for export and domestic consumption.</p>
                        <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0565"/>
                        <p>34. Although there has been some increase in criticism of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs economic policies—particularly the austerity program—there is no indication that discontent has reached a point where it would jeopardize political stability. Nevertheless, unrest among labor, the unemployed, and businessmen, particularly those hurt by government import restrictions, must be continually monitored by <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. Perhaps the most significant political impact of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs economic policies will be felt by his successor, who will probably inherit many of the same deepseated economic problems that have proven politically burdensome since Trujilloʼs demise.</p>
                        <p>35. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> campaigned on the slogan “neither injustices nor privileges” and has subsequently committed himself to some important social reforms, but on the whole his government has had a paternalistic and conservative orientation. In education, for example, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has not assigned sufficient priority to financing needed changes. Although he seems to have remained a symbol of hope for the countryʼs large rural population, he has come under criticism from campesino groups and progressive churchmen for moving too slowly in agrarian reform and rural improvement. One promising development has been <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs commitment to a program of family planning which may eventually lead to a reduction of the 3.5 percent annual population growth.</p>
                        <p>36. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs conservative labor policies have produced a potentially dangerous vacuum within organized labor. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has taken the view that labor should remain aloof from politics—despite the fact the government dominates the economy—and he has done nothing to encourage the growth of effective unions. Although his policy has reduced organized Communist labor strength significantly, it also has stunted the growth of democratic unions. The austerity program—which includes a freeze on wages designed to compensate for the rapid increase in labor costs that occurred in the immediate post-Trujillo period—and the governmentʼs lack of sympathy for legitimate labor grievances have produced growing labor discontent. In response to mounting pressure for a relaxation of the wage freeze, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> announced last month that he would examine the austerity program with an eye to making modifications later this year.</p>
                        <p>37. A major vulnerability of the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> government is its lack of appeal to left-of-center urban students and youth, organized labor, the urban unemployed, and left-wing middle-class intellectuals and professionals. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs pragmatic and austere style, his generally conservative policies, and his association with the Trujillo regime have contributed to his alienation from these sectors. Although discontent has led to minor strikes and demonstrations in the Santo Domingo area, the problem has not become critical. Nevertheless, tension between the government and sectors influenced by the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and the extreme left <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0566"/>could lead to spontaneous unrest and become a major problem in a period of political crisis.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Prospect of the 1970 Elections</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>38. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs attention will be drawn increasingly to the 1970 elections despite his continued concern over short-term political stability. Although <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs intentions with regard to his own candidacy are not completely clear, he has publicly said that he “does not aspire to re-election.” If <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> did choose to run, he probably would have the edge over any potential challenger. He would have to contend, however, with the strong aversion of many politically influential Dominicans to the concept of a second term, as well as left–and right-wing allegations that his intention is to perpetuate “Trujillo-style” one-man rule.</p>
                        <p>39. In advancing either his own or anotherʼs candidacy, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will have to choose between his present right-of-center political base in the Reformist Party (<gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>) and a more moderate political coalition that would be better attuned to the need for a broad array of political, economic, and social changes. There has been considerable speculation among Dominican politicians that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will support liberal former provisional president <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Hector Garcia Godoy</persName>, who is now ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> may attempt to establish a political coalition behind <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> that would include liberal <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> elements, moderates in the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and the Revolutionary Social Christian Party (<gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>40. If a middle-of-the-road coalition is to develop, it seems likely that the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> will be in a position to play a key role. The <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> was greatly encouraged by its showing in the recent municipal elections when it quadrupled its vote and for the first time won elective offices. During the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> administration, the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> had moderated its previously radical line, engaged in spirited but on the whole constructive criticism of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, attempted to broaden its support at the expense of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, and made cordial overtures to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Embassy. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has expressed admiration for the Social Christians, even remarking that the <gloss target="#t_PRSC1">PRSC</gloss> is the only hope for the evolution of a two-party democratic political system.</p>
                        <p>41. As presidential elections approach, political tensions almost certainly will increase. Both the right and left are sure to believe they are deeply threatened by either <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs continuation in office or the emergence of <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> as a moderate alternative. The military remembers with deep distaste <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>ʼs term as provisional president when he exiled key officers who had fought against the “constitutionalists.” Vice President Lora, whose political outlook is markedly authoritarian and conservative, seems likely to use the Reformist Party to mount his own presidential drive. Elements of the anti-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> right, in turn, may push the candidacy of exile General Wessin. In short, <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0567"/>the 1970 elections may well unearth the latent Dominican political antagonisms that have been hidden under the relative tranquility of the <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> administration.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">The Future</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>42. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will probably be able to continue to hold a firm grip on power without having to resort to extreme authoritarian measures. He has so far shown himself able to avoid the serious errors or major miscalculations that could jeopardize stability. His acceptance by the military seems relatively firm, and he will probably be able to count on the continued support of a broad sector of other influential political groupings. Nevertheless, the continued existence of deep political antagonisms, which are at time intensified by the Presidentʼs actions, and the unyielding opposition of the right and radical left make for continuing political tension that could result in a serious challenge to his government. Should the 61–year-old <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> suddenly disappear from the scene—either through assassination or for reasons of health—prospects for stability would be considerably dimmed under his constitutional successor, Vice President Lora.</p>
                        <p>43. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs position will remain dependent on continued <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic and political support. Should the opposition consider a new United States administration less committed to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, it would probably step up its efforts to exploit the Presidentʼs political vulnerabilities.</p>
                        <p>44. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs dependence on the military and other established social groupings will continue to limit his willingness and ability to press for politically difficult social and economic reforms. He may be able, however, to fulfill some of the commitments for reform he has made and may benefit from a moderate upswing in the economy.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Review current political mood and governmentʼs handling of problem areas since municipal elections opportune as August 16 approaches, day on which municipal governments throughout country are renewed or change over. Array of problems facing <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> government is formidable but in many instances represents chronic problems or variations of chronic problems. Principal ones include: (a) charges of lack “democratic” atmosphere within which opposition can function, prompted in particular by closing <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> radio program; (b) hunger strike self-styled political prisoners; (c) acts terrorism and alleged police repression and excesses; (d) recent attempts largely by Haitians seek political asylum Venezuelan and Chilean embassies; (e) reports of new rumblings in armed forces; (f) reports of planning for violence in connection change-over national district government. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> in past has been able through combination factors handle or control similar problems and has projected image of man in charge. Now, however, and especially since May elections, President has become more passive and defensive in face opposition actions. Consequence is accumulation of problems and lack of tone in government. Our judgement, however, is that no acute crisis looming; but we are concerned that gradual downhill slide will continue if <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> does not reassume direction firmly. It would be in this context that government would become increasingly vulnerable to initiatives on part opposition or unforeseen events.</p>

                        <p rend="center">MINUTES OF THE <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> MEETING ON SITUATION IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> began with a review of the Dominican Republic situation, considered in two broad aspects. The first was an analysis of the present situation, and the second was a look at future prospects.</p>
                        <p>He summed up his current analysis as follows: although the Government has been stronger as a result of the May municipal elections, it has also failed to exploit its improved position. The general movement seems to be that of a gradual downward decline, which is slow enough, however, that the Governmentʼs stability is not likely to be threatened before the 1970 elections. He estimated the odds as considerably better than even that the Government will survive through the 1970 elections. Such a survival he saw as representing tremendous psychological value to the country and the population.</p>
                        <p>Among the various elements, the military is strongly pro–<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. The personal ambitions of certain officers are the source of some conflicts; and General Wessin supporters still exist but their numbers are not increasing. President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> considers Wessinʼs support as static. The opposition to the Government continues to be flat-out and thorough, but also uncoordinated and uneffective. The <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> has been expanding its contacts with communist-led and Wessin forces. Although the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> under its present radical leadership will continue to seek issues on which to unify the opposition to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, no such issues exist as yet. Overall opposition is disunited and weak.</p>
                        <p>The Social Christians, who were strong in the recent elections, are under pressure from their younger elements to begin organizing for 1970 and to undertake across the board opposition to the government.</p>
                        <p>The Communist Party continues in the disarray shown over the last two and one half years. Although the communists have a limited terrorist capacity, they do not themselves constitute an effective political force.</p>
                        <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0570"/>
                        <p>On the right, Wessin has no chance in electoral terms. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> may permit him to return soon in order to speed the process of deflating his electoral campaign which enjoys little support. Other right wing elements are implacably anti-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The economic situation is neither good nor bad. The effects of this yearʼs drought are being overcome and agricultural production should rise about 6%. The overall economic growth rate in ʼ69 should be between 5 and 6%, and in 1972 should also attain 6%. The latter estimate is largely based on a $150 million ferro-nickel investment by Falcon-bridge of Canada which should come on stream in 1972 and provide significant foreign exchange relief to the economy. The years 1970–71 are the difficult ones, with a particularly heavy debt service burden also emerging in 1969.</p>
                        <p>The general investment climate is unstable largely due to the force of the protectionist spirit of those influencing the President. Should the Dominican Republic pursue enlightened policies in 1970–71, there is a fair chance of a 5–6% growth rate. No one should underestimate, said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName>, the economic incompetence of the Government. It is oriented to the past and has no concept of the development process. It has to be pushed and hauled to make intelligent decisions.</p>
                        <p>However, even though <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is not too enlightened, both we and the Dominican Republic owe him much. Taking into account the difference in the outlook today and that of September 1966, much of the improvement must be credited to <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. His governmentʼs conduct has been essentially democratic.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the future, the Ambassador felt that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is moving toward a decision to run again for the usual reasons that incumbents find compelling. Although his decision is not yet final, he is moving in this direction.</p>
                        <p>A second <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> term, according to the Ambassador, would jeopardize our hopes for real economic development because of his lack of instinct for and knowledge of the measures required for development. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will not announce any decision before early 1970. We can expect however, if his decision is made earlier, it will be reflected in exacerbation of our running battles with him in development areas. In <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs absence Augusto Larra would be the likely Reformista candidate. Wessin has no chance of winning. On the left, it is still not clear whether the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> would fill the candidacy or who it might be. Although predictions on this are risky, <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> is not likely to run. <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> is trying to form a coalition but this is a hard thing to pull off. He would have problems with the military and with the right. The 1970 elections are still too close to 1965 for us to witness the normal play of political forces in the Dominican Republic. The ʼ65 tensions will probably not be dissolved before the 1974 elections.</p>
                        <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0571"/>
                        <p>The problems we will face in 1969 will derive partly from the impending elections and partly from what he described as the “incredible belief” of the Dominicans that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has a voice in every political act in the country. Even if our stance in the elections were totally neutral, this fact would not be believed by the Dominicans. This in itself constitutes a problem.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> then answered several questions. He identified the Mayor of Santo Domingo as a possible new face in politics and Antonio Guzman of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> as a better prospect than most as a candidate. He noted that a <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> decision to run might be the issue over which the right and left could unite. It would certainly produce an immediate increase of conspiratorial action from both the left and right. <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs chances of surviving such conspiracy, he said, were slightly better than even. His second term, however, would be plagued by continued efforts to overthrow him and his administration.</p>
                        <p>There is growing awareness within the Catholic Church of the need for structural change, but the conservative majority still holds back the young liberals. It is still a strong influence in the Campo, where it is partly Social Christian oriented and partly conservative.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the military, he thought it would intervene if <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> were elected but probably would not, at least initially, should <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName> be elected.</p>
                        <p>He noted the unique Dominican sensitivity to U.S. domestic politics, particularly within the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>. A Nixon election might give the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> a feeling that there is no hope to overcome the conservative forces in the Dominican Republic, allied with those of the U.S., and therefore move it to take some drastic action. At this point, however, it is incapable of sufficient violence to overthrow the Government.</p>
                        <p>For the 1970–74 period, he felt there are some leaders in the center and center left factors who could provide adequate leadership despite the serious lack of human resources.</p>
                        <p>The National University is in terrible shape, with a low level of competence and continuing political turmoil. The best prospect at this time for U.S. help to the universities lies with the Catholic University of Santiago.</p>

                        <p rend="center">SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>The Embassy estimates that unless President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> is assassinated or unless there is a combination of other major negative contingencies, such as a Cuban-supported return of <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> or a Communist takeover in Haiti, the Constitutional Government will not face a direct and immediate threat to its survival in the short run, i.e., before the change of Administrations in the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0574"/>
                        <p>For the longer run, i.e., through June 1969, the Embassy—again assuming the absence of major negative contingencies—concludes that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will be capable of sustaining his position but with some progressive loss of authority and capacity to govern effectively. We judge it probable that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, under the pressure of many factors which are identified and analyzed in the body of this assessment, will find it necessary to announce his decision on reelection before the end of the period. We further estimate that, were he to make a decision for reelection, the fragility of the situation would increase but that, with the expected support from the military to whom he would probably be obliged to resort increasingly, he would still be able to maintain himself in power.</p>

                            <item>A number of the chronic problems cited in the “Trends and Developments” section of this report will continue to plague the government during both the short and middle-term periods covered by the assessment. While a number of the “tactical” problems existing in mid-August have been handled and their potentially disturbing effects dissipated, a number of new issues have arisen or are beginning to emerge which pose longer-term implications adverse to the political health of the country. Pre-eminent among these is the election/reelection issue and the manner in which it is beginning to relate to many of the old and new sensitive political questions.</item>
                            <label>B.</label>
                            <item>In the short-term period, i.e. to January 20, 1969, the usual yearend factors will play their part in adding grist to the rumor mill, creating uneasiness and disaffection in certain sectors and adding to the vague reports that circulate from a variety of sources that there is abroad a kind of anti-government psychosis of such an ill-defined character that it is impossible to pinpoint its causes or evaluate their impact or importance. Among these year-end factors are the uncertainty always caused by the possibility—and rumors of the possibility—of changes in the Cabinet and in the upper ranks of the military at the beginning of the new year, and the opportunity for agitation represented by the still unsettled issue of the Christmas bonus for government workers. These standard, even seasonal, negative political factors tending to exert short-run pressures on the government are not any greater than in previous Decembers except in the sense that this is the third year that they have operated. Moreover, their effect is balanced to some degree by the current disarray of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>—whose participation would be critical to any serious exploitation of the negative seasonal factors—and that partyʼs probable need for time to digest <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0575"/>whatever decisions come out of the meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> at Benidorm. In the short-run, therefore, and on the basis of the analysis appearing in the previous sections of this assessment, the Embassy continues to be of the opinion that there is no direct and immediate threat to the survival of the constitutional government. This short-term assessment would have to be modified should one or more of the following events occur:
<list>
                                    <label>(1)</label>
                                    <item>The return of <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName> as the leader of a Cuban-supported attempt against the Dominican government accompanied by the simultaneous outbreak of terrorism and/or urban and rural guerrilla activity by the extreme left. The Embassy anticipates that in this event, the evidence for which is thin, the reaction of the government and the military would be prompt and at least reasonably effective and that such a development would not in and of itself topple the government.</item>
                                    <label>(2)</label>
                                    <item>The illegal return of Wessin. In this event, and the odds are against its occurring, we estimate, the Embassy believes that the effects of such entry would be containable in the short term.</item>
                                    <label>(3)</label>
                                    <item>The adoption by the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> as a result of the meeting in Benidorm of an aggressively radical line calling for direct and violent action against the government through street demonstrations, strikes etc., with the cooperation of Communist elements. The Embassy believes that such a development, although manageable, would be harder to deal with than would <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Caamaño</persName>, but it doubts that the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> will adopt this course and, even if it did, that it would have time to elaborate and put such a plan into operation within the six-week period of time being considered.</item>
                                    <label>(4)</label>
                                    <item>A wave of concentrated, continuous terrorist attacks by the extreme left (perhaps abetted independently by the extreme right, for its own purposes), directed especially at the security forces. Because of the probability of strong, uncontrollable, relatively indiscriminating reactions by the security forces, a very tense situation could develop. Thus far we have no evidence of such a program, nor do we believe that the extreme left has the will or the cohesion to carry it out. If, contrary to our expectations, it were to happen, we believe that there is a better than even chance that the government would survive it in the short run.</item>
                                    <label>(5)</label>
                                    <item>A Communist-oriented takeover in Haiti. This would create apprehension and confusion here, and, if it were accompanied by Communist terrorism or guerrilla attack on this side of the island, the consequences would be serious but still, in our estimate, manageable. (Other developments in Haiti, such as chaos following the disappearance of Duvalier, would have unsettling but less grave repercussions in the Dominican Republic.)</item>
                                    <label>(6)</label>
                                    <item>The assassination of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. Should this occur (and the usual rumors continue) all bets would be off and an entirely new and dangerous political situation would be created.</item>
                                </list>
                            </item>

                            <label>C.</label>
                            <item>It will be noted that, except in the case of the last, we estimate that any single one of the possible major “special” contingencies can be handled, although with varying degrees of difficulty, by the government. If they were to occur in combination, the survivability of the government would come into considerably more serious question.</item>
                            <label>D.</label>
                            <item>Having looked at the period up to January 20, 1969 and having concluded that no direct and immediate danger of the governmentʼs overthrow exists (barring the unforeseen developments outlined immediately above), the question arises whether that same assessment is valid for the middle term, i.e. up to June 30, 1969. It is probable that some of the factors now in play or emerging will have assumed greater importance by the time that period is over. Among these are the impact of a repatriated Wessin on the political scene; a probable increase in activity on the part of certain groups of the extreme left; the increased activity of the <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss> and the other opposition parties, including <persName corresp="#p_GGH1">Garcia Godoy</persName>; the growing fatigue, literal and figurative, of the government and its chief and the consequent rise in irritation and resentment caused by inept decisions, particularly in the economic sector; and, looming over all, the election/reelection issue with its broad impact. Against these factors must be balanced the demonstrated ability of <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to postpone any direct and meaningful confrontation through the utilization of a broad range of political and security measures, continuing support of the Constitutional Government by the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, with its important economic and political/psychological effects, and the probable moderate improvement in the economy, unless external resources are denied or seriously reduced, in which case the consequences would extend well beyond the economic sector.</item>
                            <label>E.</label>
                            <item>Again barring major negative contingencies of the type listed for the short-term period, the Embassy estimates that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will be capable, through June 1969, of sustaining his position but with some progressive loss of authority and capacity to govern effectively. The pressures on <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> to make up his mind on reelection will increase significantly, and the Embassy believes it probable that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will find it necessary to make and announce a definitive decision before June 30, 1969, not only because of the mounting clamor from the opposition but also for the sake of his own party. The effects of such a decision, the Embassy believes, would be less unsettling if <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> were to opt for non-reelection. Should he decide to run again, the situation would become considerably more fragile but, with the expected support of the military to whom he would probably be obliged to resort increasingly, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>, we judge, would still be able to survive.</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>A recent upsurge of rumors has resulted in some heightening of political tensions in the Dominican Republic. A meeting in Spain between former President <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> and a commission from his opposition <gloss target="#t_PRD1">PRD</gloss>, President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs announcement that ex-General Wessin may return early in 1969, and the continued uncertainty regarding the whereabouts of Constitutionalist leader Caamano, have contributed to the more uncertain atmosphere. However, we believe that President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has maintained his relatively strong position and that his constitutional government will not face a direct and immediate threat to its survival in the short term.</p>
                        <p>We also conclude that <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> will be capable of sustaining his position through June 1969, but probably with some creeping loss of authority and capacity to govern effectively. The President may find it necessary to announce his decision on reelection before the end of this period. (National elections are scheduled for May 1970.) Should he decide to seek reelection, the fragility of the political situation would increase. However, we estimate that, with anticipated continuing military support, he would still be able to maintain himself in power.</p>

                        <p>Zwick agrees the $9 million is needed for balance of payments support—but fears that authorization now will take the pressure off for better performance on the Supporting Assistance Loan.<note n="6" xml:id="d222fn6">Zwickʼs memorandum explained that $8 million in supporting assistance was withheld because of the Dominican Republic Governmentʼs less than satisfactory performance under the previous yearʼs assistance package, and that it therefore made little economic sense to go forward with the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 agreement since the two forms of assistance were equivalent resources. In concluding Zwick wrote: “I cannot judge whether or not a delay in authorizing this <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 agreement would seriously influence the decisions or capability of anyone planning to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>. But in the absence of explicit evidence I recommend deferral of this agreement.

                                <item>—Further delay would be interpreted by both <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> and his opposition as a deliberate U.S. decision to draw back from full support for his government.</item>
                                <item>—Political storm clouds have been gathering in the Dominican Republic as we approach the Presidential election—plotting against <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> has been growing.

                        <p>Charlie Zwick says that if you wish to take more fully into account the political judgment of <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName>, he would then recommend authorization <hi rend="italic">with subsequent releases of food contingent on better self-help performance</hi>.</p>
                        <p>He would release the food in three equal installments contingent on the meeting of special commitments which parallel those involved in the Supporting Assistance loan.</p>
                        <p>I believe that a more flexible version of this option would meet the minimum political requirement—that we demonstrate prompt, continued support for <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName>ʼs program. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> should have enough negotiating leeway to insure that this objective is met. Specifying now the number or size of the installments, or tying the self-help criteria rigidly to other loans, would not be wise. These are issues better left to the negotiation.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you approve negotiation of this <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 agreement as recommended in the Freeman/<persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> memorandum, with the <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0580"/>additional stipulation that commodities be released in installments after special reviews of Dominican performance.</p>

                        <p>On January 6, 1964, spokesmen for Leyland Motors Ltd. in the United Kingdom and the Cuban Government in Havana announced the conclusion of a contract for the sale of 400 passenger buses and spare parts, for approximately $11 million, to be delivered to Cuba over the course of the year on 5–year credit terms, with an option for Cuba to buy 1,000 more.</p>
                        <p>During a telephone conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> on January 7, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked about British trade with Cuba and whether President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> had objected to it in his meetings with the British Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> replied, “Well, I think you better say we raised it with them because they would be in position to say no formal objection was made, and the reason, as I say, was that they would have come back, O.K. you sell wheat [the United States had sold wheat to the Soviet Union in 1963], what the hell you talking about?” After a long pause, <persName>Johnson</persName> asked, “Well, what is the difference?” <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> replied: “We maintain that Cuba should be isolated because itʼs exporting subversion. They would maintain that Cuba is no worse than the Soviet Union and that we greatly exaggerate this, and in their public, theyʼd be right. I mean thatʼs their politics. The British man on the street thinks weʼve got a neurosis on Cuba.

                        <p>In a meeting the following day, Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> briefed the President on the status of Cuban economic developments, among a number of other subjects.

The current balance is probably near $100 million, the highest level since 1960.”</p>

                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Three small-scale sabotage operations have been approved by the Special Group, but this recommendation is based on a routine continuation of broad policy guidance which I think you may wish to review. The three operations involved are:
<list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>a commando sabotage operation against a coastal warehouse and pier;</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>a sabotage attack against naval or patrol vessels in a harbor; and</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>a sabotage operation against a fuel barge proceeding in coastal waters.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>All of these operations would have been approved three months ago, and indeed one of them is a rescheduling of an operation aborted because of high seas. While it is always hard to predict the noise level in these matters, these operations seem comparable to the small attack on a Cuban naval patrol which occurred in late December which <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> promptly blamed on you (in fact it was an operation approved before November 22 and not cancelled thereafter because it seemed to fall within the guidance you expressed in your first review of the Cuban problem).</p>
                        <p>The policy question now is this: If we continue these even small sabotage operations, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> will certainly know it. Equally, if we call them off, he will know it, and so will the Russians. We thus have an opportunity to choose.</p>
                        <p>I doubt if this choice should be made on momentum alone.</p>
                        <p>I therefore recommend a Cabinet-level review of the whole principle of covert sabotage against Cuba. I know that <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> has never liked it and that <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> thinks it does very little good. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> are for it, and so are most of the middle-level officers dealing with the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> problem. I myself consider the matter extremely evenly balanced, but before hearing full argument, my guess is that in your <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0583"/>position I would stop sabotage attacks on the ground that they are illegal, ineffective, and damaging to our broader policy. I might then wish to make a little capital from this decision with the Soviet Union.</p>

                        <p>2. The President entered the room shortly, accompanied by Bill Moyers and <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Jack Valenti</persName>. Others present were <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>, General Taylor, Dr. Seaborg, Adrian Fisher, and myself.

                        <p>c. The President then reverted to Cuba and said that he questioned seriously whether these sabotage efforts were the proper thing for the U.S. to be doing. He thought they were both hypocritical and ineffectual and while he understood the need for some of them to maintain the morale of internal dissidents to the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime and to maintain the morale of Cuban exiles, he thought probably these considerations were outweighed by the hypocrisy of our seeking peace and talking peace and conducting this sort of activity on the side. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that he had never been in favor of this program and had the same doubts <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0584"/>the President did. <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said that he too had never been in favor of this program and questioned our participation. I stated that while this program was conducted by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, every action taken had the full approval of the Special Group on which the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense were adequately represented and that the program was designed in part for the specific purpose of generating internal sabotage and dissidents with a view to creating as many problems as possible for <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and with a view to getting an escalation of anti-<persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> activities in Cuba, that over the long run any type of effort such as this was an irritant to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and that such action had some effect, even though slight, on the Cuban economy. I said that over the long run you could not expect the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime to fall from these actions alone but that every little bit helped, and that we had noticed over the past four months a considerable increase in sabotage actions generated from internal Cuban elements over which we exercised no control. I said that I could not take exception to the fact that this policy was a hypocritical one in the light of a peace offensive although I did not feel we were trying to make peace with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. I also pointed out that sabotage activities in North Vietnam likewise had hypocritical aspects. At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> demurred and said North Vietnam was an entirely different matter but he gave no reasons therefor and this point was not developed further. General Taylor noted that in connection with sabotage operations they kept <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> constantly on the alert and kept his forces heavily occupied running hither and yon. The President noted that this was probably true but so little gain in it and generally seemed disaffected with sabotage efforts. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out that there was some value in maintaining some pressure of this type since to completely desist would eventually lead <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> to believe that he was immune from retaliation. The President then directed that he wanted a complete review of our Cuban policy and some new, imaginative thinking developed. I stated that this was presently heavily in train in all appropriate agencies of the Government, and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> nodded their agreement. The President said he would want to meet as soon as people had drawn up their proposals. In connection with Cuba the President noted that he continued to desire the most drastic pressures on our Allies to insist upon their cooperation and assistance and compliance in our economic denial program against Cuba. He said that Segni and Erhard had both assured him we could count on the full cooperation of Italy and West Germany to cease any further Cuban trade. He said he wanted similar discussions prepared for him whenever he met these leaders and for our leaders to take the same line in any discussions they might have.</p>

                        <p rend="center">I. The Current Situation in Cuba</p>
                        <p>During 1963 the situation in Cuba steadily worsened. The economy continued its decline and <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> was not able to halt the downward curve. Hurricane Flora intensified Cubaʼs economic problems. Disillusionment and apathy among the great majority of the population continued to grow, and enthusiasm was increasingly restricted to a hard core. As popular support waned, coercion and terror were employed more and more to maintain the regimeʼs control. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs drive to convert Cuba into a standard communist prototype caused increasing disillusionment among his original followers. His stature in the eyes of many Cubans and Latin Americans suffered with the realization, in the aftermath of the October missile crisis, that Cuba had been a pawn and <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> a dupe of Soviet policy.</p>
                        <p>Despite extraordinary efforts, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> has not been able to stop acts of defiance against his regime. Guerrilla activity, although scattered and uncoordinated, continues. Spontaneous acts of sabotage are common throughout the island. At great risk refugees still elude his security forces and sea patrols to escape from Cuba. In this atmosphere, externally mounted raids against Cuban targets have added to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs sense of frustration and helped sustain hope among the many Cubans disillusioned with his regime.</p>
                        <p>During 1963 Cubaʼs international situation seemed almost as bad as the domestic. Although chinks appeared in the wall, the U.S. policy of economic and diplomatic isolation of Cuba was holding up fairly well. Soviet-Cuban relations clearly were under strain. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> scored no foreign policy victories to provide a much needed psychological boost. His major effort to stimulate <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>-type armed uprisings <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0586"/>throughout Latin America failed to disrupt the Venezuelan elections of December and netted a potentially embarrassing exposure that Cuba had shipped arms clandestinely to Venezuela. These internal and international trends and developments brought Cuba to a low point during 1963.</p>
                        <p>Within the past few weeks, however, five developments have given the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime an important political-psychological lift. They are:

                                        <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> paid an unofficial visit to the Soviet Union January 13–22, at the end of which Khrushchev announced that the two nations had concluded a trade agreement that would guarantee Cuban income against fluctuations in world sugar prices.</note> The protocol calls for Cuban-Soviet trade to increase by 22 per cent over 1963. Soviet exports, about 40 per cent of which will be on credit, will increase by at least 10 per cent.</item>

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>These recent developments have provided the upward political and psychological thrust <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs regime badly needed. He now has a firmer base for his repeated claims that Cuba has survived the full brunt of a major United States effort to destroy the Cuban revolution, claims likely to impress many Latin Americans as well as Cubans. In addition, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> now has the possibility of producing some tangible evidence that his regime can restore forward momentum in the economy. Consequently, the general position of the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime is much improved over that of three or four months ago.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>A detailed discussion of the covert elements of our program appears in Section III.</p>
                        <p>As stated above, all these courses of action interact and are interdependent. For example, our covert economic denial operations are designed to reinforce and be reinforced by our overt measures of economic pressure. Both types of activities directed against the economy are intended to aggravate existing economic difficulties and thus to increase the level of disaffection not only in the popular mass but particularly in the power centers of the regime. This disaffection enhances our ability to establish meaningful contact with figures in the military and other power centers and to develop intelligence sources. This disaffection is in turn intensified by the evidence of vulnerability to outside attacks provided by the success of covert sabotage and harassment activities. By the same token, the failure or elimination of one of these mutually supporting courses of action jeopardizes the others and thus compromises the entire program.</p>
                        <p>Through 1963, these courses of action were having a measurable positive impact. We are now confronted, however, by a series of developments, described in Section I, which threaten to arrest or even reverse our forward movement. The situation is particularly acute with respect to the maintenance of our economic pressures. This fact makes this review of our covert operations particularly timely and important.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III. Concept of the Covert Action Program</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> covert action program aims at maintaining all feasible pressures on Cuba and at creating and exploiting situations in Cuba calculated to stimulate dissident elements within the regime, particularly in the armed forces, to carry out a coup. The objective of the coup would be to remove the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>/Communists from the regime and to eliminate the entire Soviet presence from Cuba. Recognizing that the U.S. is engaged in a race against time with Cuba and its Soviet ally to obstruct the consolidation of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs regime at home and to prevent him from achieving his ambitions in Latin America, we set the time frame for this program at about eighteen months from June 1963.</p>
                        <p>As originally conceived and approved in June 1963, the covert action program was based on the assumption that U.S. policy precludes a military invasion or a full blockade of Cuba which could lead to a confrontation with the Soviet Union. In addition, the covert action program was and is predicated on the thesis that its chance of success would depend heavily on a sustained and intensive effort in other sectors, <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0590"/>particularly the overt economic denial and political isolation programs, by all elements of the United States Government. Thus, the inter-action of the overt and covert effort against Cuba is regarded as a vital and irreplaceable factor if there is to be any hope of accomplishing the overall mission.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>ʼs integrated covert action program consists of the following interdependent courses of action:

As an economic weapon, it is designed to supplement and support the overall economic denial program by damaging economically important installations and to add to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs economic problems by forcing him to divert money, manpower and resources from economic to internal security activities. As a stimulus to resistance, sabotage and physical harassment operations provide visible and dramatic evidence of the existence and capability of organized resistance against the regime. To the extent that these operations are successful, they also demonstrate to the Cuban population and elite groups the vulnerability of the regime to militant action. It is recognized that no single act of sabotage by itself can materially affect the economy or stimulate resistance, but we believe that the cumulative psychological and political impact within Cuba of sustained sabotage operations is a necessary element in the accomplishment of our mission.</item>

Insurgency and sabotage inside Cuba are not part of a coordinated program; they are acts of individual or small group defiance. They are stimulated by many factors, and no one factor can be assigned entire credit. Sabotage incidents, which include a high proportion of sugar cane burnings, have a tendency to be seasonal, a fact which further obscures statistical analysis. Although it is true that from a low point in sabotage incidents during the summer of 1963 there was a heavy increase during the fall (following the commencement of our raiding activity), we believe that clearer light is shed on the effects of our harassment program by the statements of witnesses of varying points of view within Cuba and by the acts of the Cuban regime itself.</p>
                        <p>Since 1 August 1963, five sabotage raids have been attempted.<note n="4" xml:id="d226fn4">Annex I contains a brief review of these operations. [Footnote in the source text. Annex I is attached but not printed.]</note> All were successful. There was substantial damage to the target; all participants <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0592"/>were safely recovered and the plausible deniability of the operations was not compromised.</p>
                        <p>The lack of proof of U.S. involvement did not prevent <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> from charging the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> with responsibility. Indeed, almost every act of defiance against his regime has been credited to the Agency.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs emotional reactions to real or rumored security threats point up his acute sensitivity to internal resistance and suggests that he feels his regime to be far from secure from external threats. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, has reacted to the sabotage raids with much less vigor and bluster than we anticipated. Their only sharp reaction, aside from the expected propaganda, followed a series of air raids during August and September sponsored by Cuban exile groups operating from Florida and for which the Agency had no responsibility. They did no real damage, but they did demonstrate that the Cuban air defense system could be breached, and they added substantially to the psychological impact of our first two raids.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a detailed discussion of the results of the covert program.]</p>
                        <p rend="center">V. Impact of Cessation of Sabotage Operations</p>
                        <p>Because of the visible and dramatic nature of sabotage operations, their cessation would soon be noted by all interested parties to and observers of U.S./Cuban relations. The cessation of these raids, however disclaimable by the U.S. the raids themselves may be, would probably be interpreted in Latin America and certainly inside Cuba as a switch of U.S. policy from one of discreet encouragement and support of aggressive action against the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime to one of “coexistence” and eventual accommodation with a <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>/Communist Cuba. Without constant and visible signs of offensive action against Cuba, a weakening process would be set in motion which could well lead the countries of Latin America to draw their own conclusions from these indicators and embark on accommodation policies of their own. Those governments in Latin America already threatened by Castroites in their own countries are likely to be subjected to even stronger domestic pressures.</p>
                        <p>As this belief spreads, Western European and other free world countries eager to trade with Cuba will come to feel that they may safely ignore and evade, to an even greater extent than they do now, U.S. appeals for the economic and political isolation of Cuba. An important additional economic effect would be the release into normal economic activity of manpower and funds now tied up in defense against raids.</p>
                        <p>Finally, and most important, this development in time is bound to have a severe demoralizing effect on the internal resistance against <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. The Cuban exile community and particularly its militant and <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0593"/>articulate elements would be acutely sensitive to a cessation of raids and can be expected to react vociferously. Judging from past experience, we can expect a new surge of domestic political agitation on the part of the numerous Cuban exiles who have political connections within the U.S.</p>
                        <p>In the event that it is decided to terminate <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-controlled sabotage and harassment operations, it cannot be assumed that the autonomous groups, despite the greater deniability of their actions, could take over entirely the mission of furnishing proof of visible resistance to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and inspiring internal elements to take the personal risks necessary to set a coup in motion. Autonomous groups are as yet untested in their capability to conduct successful sabotage and harassment operations on a sustained basis. It is unlikely that in the next months the autonomous groups will develop the ability to match <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-controlled operations, either in quantity or quality.</p>
                        <p>If sabotage and harassment operations were to be terminated for the autonomous groups as well as for the Agency, its support to the autonomous groups must also be terminated completely as otherwise we would not be in a position to insure that they would discontinue raids and sabotage. Such termination would compound the effects of the cessation of our own raids, particularly in those areas in the Caribbean where the autonomous groups have been most active.</p>
                        <p rend="center">VI. The Residual Program</p>
                        <p>In the event it is decided to abandon the core of the covert program, we will be obliged to fall back on essentially overt courses of action which are already operating but which can be refined and intensified, provided the political risks and costs are judged acceptable and we receive adequate cooperation from our allies.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">A. Action against free-world economic ties with Cuba</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Because of the recent erosion of our efforts in this sector and the clear intention of the Cubans and Soviets to expand Cuban economic relations with the free world, a series of recommendations to intensify this course of action has been made and is now being presented. The basic issue in the recommendations is our ability and willingness to incur the political costs and risks that heightened economic pressure would involve. Even if the recommendations are adopted completely, we could have no real assurance that our attempts to curtail Cuban-free world economic ties would be successful. On the other hand, if the actions and commitments included in the recommendations are not adopted, it is a near certainty that, under present circumstances, our economic pressures will be reduced to ineffectiveness. In any case, it must be clearly recognized that no amount of economic pressure can by itself bring down the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> government, at least as long as the Soviets <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0594"/>are prepared to subsidize the Cuban economy. The curtailment and disruption of Cuban economic ties with the free world can only contribute, and then only over time, to the creation of the optimum situation we are trying to develop. The effectiveness of this contribution would be at least sharply impaired by the relaxation of the pressure created by covert operations. Beyond these considerations, we can never have assurance that a foreign government cooperating in the economic program will not pull out and virtually collapse the program. Entire or even important reliance on economic pressure as a substitute for the covert program would be to deliver the fate of our policy into the uncertain hands of governments which do not share our convictions and sense of priority with respect to Cuba.</p>

                        <p>As a result of the Venezuelan charges against Cuba arising from the arms cache discovery, we have been considering a series of measures which we would seek in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. It should be noted that the atmosphere for <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> adoption of strong measures has deteriorated as a result of the Panamanian crisis.</p>
                        <p>The measures which we have been studying include:

                                    <p>The principal effects of this measure, which would mean action by five countries, including Brazil, Chile and Mexico, would be to provide rather dramatic evidence of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs isolation and to deny the Cuban regime subversive facilities offered by its remaining missions in Latin America. The measure would meet heavy resistance from Mexico, Chile and particularly Brazil.</p>

                                    <p>Although this would have little practical effect economically, it would have some utility as a means of moral pressure on other free-world countries trading with Cuba.</p>

                                    <p>Over time this would lead to a reduction in the Cuban ability to move subversives to and from Latin America. It would be useful as a means of moral pressure on other free-world countries having, or wishing to establish, air services with Cuba. On the negative side it would mean the temporary loss of intelligence facilities and would have an adverse effect on Cuban exile morale by closing an existing escape route for persons inside Cuba.</p>

                                    <p>The single most damaging <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> action to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> would be an authorization for the use of force in connection with the movement of arms and men. The chances of getting a politically acceptable majority <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0595"/>for such use was estimated to be less than even before the events in Panama and the prospects have diminished since then. Such <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> action would almost certainly dramatize the Cuban issue domestically and internationally. At the present time, it appears that the surveillance system which might be authorized by the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> would involve the use of force only in the territorial waters of the countries for which the offending shipments are destined. Thus the question of <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> authorization for the use of force on the high seas will not arise.</p>

                        <p>We can intensify our measures in this sector, including major policy declarations on Cuba by the President and other senior officers of the Government. The efficacy of such efforts is entirely dependent, however, upon the substance behind them.

                        <p>The residual program set out above is substantially weaker than the present program. Accordingly, the prospects for attaining our ultimate objective of replacing the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>/Communist regime, which have been by no means certain even under the present program, would be very measurably diminished under the residual program. The elimination of the core of the present covert program, especially if accompanied <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0596"/>by a rejection or failure of the proposed expanded means of economic pressure, would raise in sharp terms the question of the need to examine the two basic alternatives: the use of force or accommodation.</p>
                        <p rend="center">VIII. Recommendation</p>
                        <p>That the covert program be continued in at least its present form and scope.</p>

Calls by free-world vessels in Cuba fell 60 percent in 1963, with British and Lebanese ships now predominating. Aviation ties with Cuba were sharply reduced in 1963, with Spanish activity running counter to the general trend.</item>

                                        <p>
                                            <hi rend="italic">Our problem</hi> is thus not just reducing the present level but preventing such an upturn. However, this is going to be increasingly difficult as, with the increased foreign exchange reserves at its disposal, Cuba will be an increasingly attractive customer and, even where blocked from direct purchases from the free world, may be able indirectly to procure some goods through the Soviet Union. Also, of course, the Soviet Union can itself make up additional shortages in the Cuban economy, albeit at some additional cost to itself and with delays in delivery.</p>
                                        <p>Thus, even if our efforts are fully successful the cutting off of free world sources of supply <hi rend="italic">cannot be expected to have a decisive effect</hi> on the Cuban economy. As a whole, however, <hi rend="italic">well-executed denial programs can seriously impair specific segments of the economy</hi> and should be able to prevent Cuba utilizing its increased sugar earnings to bring about any significant upturn. It is clear that, unless we make a major effort in this field, Cuba will increasingly be able to “normalize” its economic relations with other free-world countries and probably bring about an upturn in its economy.</p>

Because of their attitude, economic importance and special relationship with us, we need the cooperation of the British.

                        <p>Shortly after noon on February 2, 1964, the U.S. Coast Guard observed four Cuban fishing vessels off East Key in the Dry Tortugas. When the vessels were ordered to anchor and stand by for boarding, they were found to be 1.5–1.9 miles offshore of East Key and thus within the territorial seas of the United States. Following consultation with Department of State officials, the Coast Guard seized the four Cuban fishing vessels, and the crews were detained in Key West. (Telegram 452 to Bern, February 3; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 33–4 CUBA-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>) On February 3 Florida officials asked that the Cubans be turned over to them for possible prosecution under Florida law. According to telephone notes of a conversation of that same date between Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> and the President, <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> introduced the incident as a “little item” of interest, and the Presidentʼs only comment was: “Well, it doesnʼt amount to much one way or the other, does it?” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Thomas Mann</persName>, February 3, 1964, 7:10 p.m. TapeF64.10, Side A, PNO 5)</p>
                        <p>On February 4 the United States and Cuba traded protests over this incident, with Czech Embassy Counselor Zantovsky delivering a protest on behalf of Cuba to <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">John H. Crimmins</persName>, Coordinator of Cuban Affairs, and the Swiss Ambassador to Cuba, <persName corresp="#p_SEA1">Emil Anton Stadelhofer</persName>, delivering a U.S. protest in Havana. The Cuban Government claimed that the vessels were operating in international and traditional fishing waters and demanded that the fishermen be released. The U.S. Government asserted that two of the captains of the fishing vessels admitted that they were fully aware of their presence in U.S. territorial waters and that Cuban vessels had not fished in the area of the Dry Tortugas during the preceding 5 years. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> told Zantovsky that “the apparent deliberate nature of the violation” “disturbed and puzzled us.” (Memorandum of conversation, February 4; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 33–4 CUBA-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>On February 6 Cuba cut off the water supply to the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay. That night President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> alerted his top national security officials to the problem and scheduled a working group meeting for the next morning (see <ref target="#d229">Document 229</ref>). Shortly before the meeting was to begin, <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> what he knew about the water cutoff. <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> replied: “Well, the only thing I know is I donʼt think we can do nothing here, Mr. President. I just donʼt believe we can allow them to turn off the water, and make no response other than handling these [fishing] crews <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0602"/>through the courts and sending them back to Cuba. We have a whole series of options open to us, it seems to me that ought to be the function of this working group, within an hour, to lay it out for you so you can make your choice.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked, “Is there much we can do? I thought weʼd done nearly everything on Cuba?” <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that “there are many things we can do.” He also advised the President how the Cuban water could be replaced by wells, evaporators, and by water from a set of tanks and from water tanker ships.

                            <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName>—Maybe it is better to release the Captains and keep the boats. This is the first time in five years Cuban boats have been in these waters.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>—Do we want <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> to have his hand on our water? Should we ship in our own water?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>—Yes, but it ought to be a voluntary thing and not something we do under pressure. It will cost us about $2½ million a year to supply our own water. This will pose no problem for us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName>—I suggest that we go in now and cut the water pipes and say that we donʼt want <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs water. We will supply our own water.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>—Thatʼs an attractive idea. We need to reply on our own supply before <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> turns the water back on.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>—Thatʼs good because if there is a desire on the part of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> to escalate we cauterize that desire now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>—Why not say that since the water company has failed to perform, we no longer have an obligation to hold to our contract. Therefore, we will supply our own water.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> —Should we not take out some of our dependents quietly. Also, we ought to review the role of Cubans working on the base. We need to thin down the number of Cubans working on this base. If there is the slightest sign of sabotage, we must move very quickly to get rid of the Cubans.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>—We can move dependents out quickly at any time. No need to do this now unless it is a military requirement or we want to put political pressure on <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>—If we begin to use our own water we ought to move deliberately in Florida.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>—We donʼt accept the relationship between the boat arrest and turning off the water.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName>—We donʼt know the motivation behind this.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>—We know from interrogating the defectors that the Cubans were told to go to these waters to see if fish were running down there.</p>
                        <p>Unidentified Man—We are told that American boats were shrimping in these waters while the Cubans were fishing for red snapper.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>—Should we have someone in charge of getting all the facts in this expedition and assessing it? We need to know the full description <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0604"/>of what they are doing, what they had in their boats, and everything about them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>—I assume that someone has made a study of all the harassments that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> can make against us in Guantanamo Bay.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>—We should move now to deny them the $5 million in foreign exchange. These Cuban employees would not be able to take this money back to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>—But if we use our own water and then deny them the foreign exchange, this is another move upward that we are making.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>—I disagree. I think it is important to show them that we are not going to stand meekly by. The American people are tired of being pushed around.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>—I think we should try to enforce arms embargo in Venezuela to keep <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> from shipping arms there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>—This takes time and our prestige in Latin America is too important to wait and to come back simply with a “we donʼt need the water” is weak. We donʼt have to turn off any employment unless of sabotage. We can let them buy food and clothing on the base.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>—It seems to me that the breaking of the water contract is the first step. After that, we have a whole series of alternatives.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>—We have very little left that we can do in the way of legal actions against Cuba. The Venezuela arms cache is one thing we can do. If they provoke this boat incident in order to escalate, we want to keep the monkey on their back. So let us make it clear that we are going to stay in Guantanamo Bay.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>—I firmly believe we want to take the foreign exchange step.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>—Perhaps we should start cutting back on employment though not in the third generation employees.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>—But we must keep in mind if they couldnʼt use their foreign exchange, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> will keep them out of the post himself.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>—Our basic problem is that we have used up all of our possible legal moves.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>—I still think that we need to move swiftly on the Venezuela arms embargo.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>—It would be very helpful on that if we could first clear up the Panama situation. We couldnʼt do much on the Venezuela problem until Panama quiets down. This is the worst possible time for bilateral action.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>—I think it is not wise to merely respond by using our own water. We want to do much more than that. The water shipped in is not good water anyway. We need to say to the world that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> got the worst of the bargain.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> —I think that we can take the nettle out of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs hands by cutting the pipes. We could say “unless water is turned on in 24 hours we consider the contract broken and we will not be obligated.”</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>—There is some virtue in keeping this a civil breach of contract.</p>
                        <p>Taylor—The Joint Chiefs are of the opinion that this is the first step in a series of moves. Therefore, we want to now make moves of our own to strengthen our military.</p>

                        <p>President: Dick?</p>
                        <p>Russell: Yes sir.</p>
                        <p>President: These folks, I met with them this morning, after theyʼd had the night to think it over, and they havenʼt got any ideas, or any plans, or any program or anything, except Bobby Kennedy says turn the seamen loose and hold the boats. They want to put out a little statement that weʼd give them 24 hours to turn the water on, and if we didnʼt, weʼd supply our own water. I told them to hell with that, that was too innocuous to say that we would. I wanted to give them a list of alternatives, and for them to work on them during the day, and talk to the Joint Chiefs, which they had had a meeting, but they were fuzzy, they didnʼt know what to do. They thought we ought to move some <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0607"/>Marines from the west coast, and I told them to get back in that meeting. Then I told <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> to call you this afternoon before our next meeting which will be at 4:30, about 3:00 to call you and go over with you the alternatives because I valued your judgment, and then your feel of the public pulse too, and the sentiment of the Congress and all of it wrapped up in one. And to exchange viewpoints with you, give you his viewpoint and get yours before he comes to the meeting. So heʼs got a little guts, heʼs the only one in the meeting that does, he and <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Tom Mann</persName> have a little.</p>
                        <p>Russell: I ainʼt as bent on bloodshed and warfare right now down there as some of the people probably are, Mr. President. Of course, I donʼt think we can afford just to take a cringing position.</p>
                        <p>President: No, what, we, best thing that I could suggest to them after they had met from 9 to 10 before I joined them. I suggested to them that they conceive every act that we could take and that we come back this afternoon and we say we had a contract with this company which has been nationalized by <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> has violated and in effect, cancelled, and therefore, weʼre going to make our base independent of Cuba. Weʼre not, we canʼt rely on him for water, and we canʼt rely on him for anything else. We know that heʼs got 3,000 employees there and weʼre going to staff the thing ourselves, weʼre going to furnish our own water ourselves. And weʼre going to make this a base thatʼs independent, and we not only intend to operate independently, but we intend to operate it period. And maybe anything else that they can think of that we could do. We go to searching ships, why thatʼs an act of war, although weʼre trying to get Venezuela to ask us to come into their waters and inspect some of these shipments. Weʼre trying to get the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> to ask us to go in and do it, but that takes time and we canʼt do it today. And theyʼre going to expect their government to react today. And my guess is the best reaction we can have today is to say that weʼre going to operate this base independent of him, weʼre going to furnish our own water. Weʼre going to furnish our own people. Weʼre going to cut him off about 7 or 8 million dollars a year in cash, that weʼre financing him. I told them to get ahold of Khrushchev and tell him that this manʼs playing a mighty dangerous game with his marbles. I told him to tell the British and tell the French that this is a serious matter with us and that they just want to keep siccing them on and egging them on, theyʼre going to get our people in such shape that weʼre going to have a pretty difficult time operating with them. I told them letʼs not say in one hand weʼre going to cut down on our shipments to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and then ship him $7 million a year ourselves in cash for his people, even though some of these people are good people. Letʼs just let them go on back to Cuba and find jobs over there. Let him feed them out of Russian money. Letʼs donʼt feed them ourselves and let them be taking this cash back every night. And I think those two steps—</p>
                        <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0608"/>
                        <p>Russell: The most important one of all is the manner in which that message will be relayed to Khrushchev. It should be made perfectly clear to him that this man is irrational and that there will be limits to our patience, and if he keeps on that weʼll have no alternative but to take some very affirmative steps there. And that it would be very tragic if he were to support a man who would be doing things to us that he would not tolerate himself. Under the same conditions. So I hope they make that perfectly clear to him. Remind him of Hungary a little bit while theyʼre talking to him.</p>
                        <p>President: Can you think of anything else that can be done? Does that appear to be enough to show them that we are firm and decisive, that we are going to supply our own water, that we are going to supply our own people, and weʼre getting rid of them?</p>
                        <p>Russell: I suppose so. Thereʼll be some criticism of course.</p>
                        <p>President: Oh hell, <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>—</p>
                        <p>Russell: Oh, <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> will support you on that.</p>
                        <p>President: No, <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> donʼt want us to take a dime away from them. They think we ought to be feeding Cuba. So will <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Russell: No, I donʼt think theyʼll go that far.</p>
                        <p>President: Damn near it. Theyʼll say youʼre being punitive, and youʼre penalizing these poor people. Now I donʼt think we ought to do it for that reason. I think the public reason ought to be that weʼve got to have our people and we got to be secure, and we got to be independent. And their people are not dependable if their waterʼs not dependable.</p>
                        <p>Russell: There are about 2 or 3,000 of those people that live on our base there.</p>
                        <p>President: 500. And thereʼre 3,000 that work.</p>
                        <p>Russell: Well, Iʼd make it perfectly clear, that those 500 if they wanted to sever their Cuban nationality, and not go back, that Iʼd keep them there, and theyʼd spend their money on the base.</p>
                        <p>President: Now can you think of anything else?</p>
                        <p>Russell: Not right now, no sir.</p>
                        <p>President: Does that appear to you to be enough?</p>
                        <p>Russell: Well—</p>
                        <p>President: Weʼve got to be firm.</p>
                        <p>Russell: Not much more we can do. Itʼs more in the way you say it and word it than anything else. It could be worded one way where it wouldnʼt sound like itʼd be enough. It could be worded in another way and sound like itʼs a very firm statement. And Iʼm sure that your boys down there can do that.</p>
                        <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0609"/>
                        <p>President: What do you think we ought to tell them while weʼre waiting for these other things?</p>
                        <p>Russell: Tell them weʼre analyzing any steps that might be taken to fully protect American rights in the Guantanamo base.</p>
                        <p>President: Now you know they got them in that little 10 foot square cell down there and no bunks and all that kind of stuff. I told them I thought they ought to try to treat them decently and humanitarianly, because I donʼt think that does us any good to have them locked up in a ten foot cell and giving them no food or no place to sleep. Stuff like that.</p>
                        <p>Russell: You mean with the ones that donʼt go back?</p>
                        <p>President: No, these 28 fishermen that Floridaʼs got. I think itʼs a damn fool thing to pick them up. What they ought to have done, Coast Guard ought to tell them to get the hell out of here, and let them out instead of turning them over to Florida. They been fishing there up till the last few years, constantly, nobody bothered them.</p>
                        <p>Russell: Itʼs too late now. You canʼt afford to turn them loose right now, look like youʼre surrendering to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs demands.</p>
                        <p>President: Yes, I think thatʼs right. The only thing we got is we seize the ship and fine them $500. I donʼt think itʼs good to try to starve them to death.</p>
                        <p>Russell: Oh no. No, I wouldnʼt do that. Iʼd treat them just like they treat their own prisoners.</p>
                        <p>President: Well, I guess they treat their own prisoners in Florida, I guess that way. They got no bunk in this county jail down there in this place in Florida, Key West. Theyʼve got no bunks in the cell.</p>
                        <p>Russell: Is that right?</p>
                        <p>President: Yeah. Hell, yes. They treat them like we treated drunks in Texas.</p>
                        <p>Russell: [laughter] Well I expect to hear from <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> then this afternoon, Mr. President.</p>
                        <p>President: All right. Bye. Thank you.</p>

                            <placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1964-02-07T11:30:00">February 07, 1964, 11:30 a.m.</date>
                        </dateline>
                        <p>President: These people in State and Defense met during the evening on this Guantanamo thing, weʼre going to meet again after lunch. Theyʼre trying to find out exactly what has happened. I wanted to get any reactions you might have to it before I went back to meet with them again.</p>
                        <p>Mansfield: Well, evidently it appears that they violated no international law, but a state law. It is my understanding that water is being rationed on a 3-hour-a-day basis there and that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> has allowed the water to flow from the river for an hour each day, so we ought to have plenty. But here is a statement that I made this morning, if you have a minute or so.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. President, no matter how the Cuban Government may act, the Cuban fishermen are entitled to and will receive the same justice, the same impartial protection of domestic and international law as any other alien persons in similar circumstances. The fact that they are Cubans or that Cuba retaliates for their arrest is irrelevant insofar as the judicial processes of this nation are concerned. However the Cuban Government may regard the matter, there will not be any mixing of justice and water on our part. Insofar as the water supply is concerned, if the pretext of the arrest of the Cuban fishermen had not sufficed, the Havana government would have had no difficulty in creating another. It is obvious that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> wants us out of Guantanamo, and it is obvious that he is not going to make it easier for us to stay. It is equally obvious that we have no intention of being pressured out. At this time the need is for cool water at the Guantanamo base, hot words on the floors of the Congress will not supply it. We have the technical means to supply the water for as long as it takes, and in whatever quantities it takes. I have every confidence that the President will see to it that we are not parched out of Guantanamo.” And then Tommy Kuchel came in and supported it in effect.</p>
                        <p>President: Thatʼs good. Thatʼs a good statement.</p>
                        <p>Mansfield: This will save you $14,000 a month, I understand, which you wonʼt pay to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs government.</p>
                        <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0611"/>
                        <p>President: What, heʼs got a good many people working there too, and we probably ought to make, if heʼs not going to allow us to have water, we probably ought to try to make the whole base independent of him, and secure. Weʼre going to think about that today, and probably issue a pretty strong statement later in the day that, namely that weʼre going to—heʼs breached a contract, thatʼs his choice, thatʼs a bad way to do, but heʼs done it, and therefore weʼre going to supply our own water, and supply our own personnel and operate our own base.</p>
                        <p>Mansfield: You mean all the Cubans, all of them would be off?</p>
                        <p>President: Well, except those that live on the base. So we could do that. We havenʼt decided to do it, thatʼs a possibility, just declare the complete independence of it. So, we could do that now. I donʼt know what else we can do. You got any other thoughts?</p>
                        <p>Mansfield: Well, I would think that one thing which might be worth considering, this would call for very delicate handling, would be for the Florida courts just to release these people with an admonishment and send them home. We could afford to be big-hearted, but thatʼs a state matter, and that could get you into trouble because of the feeling down there.</p>
                        <p>President: And it may look like weʼre being awfully soft. I think it ought to follow its normal course, whatever they do to them, and I think most of the time they fine a captain. It looks like from the information we have this is deliberate and—</p>
                        <p>Mansfield: If I get any ideas on the base of what you said, or any other, Iʼll pass them on.<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">In a February 7 memorandum to the President, Mansfield recommended that “we ought not be governed in this matter by any passions aroused by water shut off,” that the United States should “avoid the appearance of a great nation bullying the weak by an over-display of power,” and that “it should be stressed that if the dismissal of Cuban personnel at the base (apart from the water shut-off incident) is really necessary for security of the base, then the best way to do it would be in as restrained and as unthreatening way as possible.” In conclusion, Mansfield advised the avoidance of “inadvertently strengthening <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> with his own people on what may be the mistaken assumption that displays of our anger and power will hasten his downfall.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Cuba, Guantanamo, Water Crisis/Cuban Fishing Boats, 2/64)</note>

                            <item>Ambassador David Ormsby Gore, British Embassy</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>I spoke this morning with Ambassador Ormsby Gore regarding the seizure of the Cuban shipping boats and the cutting off of the water supply at Guantanamo. I explained that the circumstances under which the boats invaded our territorial waters raised questions as to Cuban purposes. I pointed out that we might be at the outset of a deliberate Cuban policy of trying to drive us either into a dialogue or out of Guantanamo. I pointed out the possible relevance of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs trip to Russia and the pending problems in Panama.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that American public opinion was aroused and that Americans would be more than ever sensitive to actions by our friends that appeared to be assisting the Cubans—such as the British bus deal. I pointed out that Britain was being held responsible for breaking the line and that the French truck deal announced today appeared to the American public as a predictable result of the British action.</p>
                        <p>I explained that the imposition of economic sanctions against Cuba was the only weapon short of an act of war that could make the support of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs Cuba more costly to the Soviet Union, while at the same time creating conditions of economic stringency that might ultimately bring about the elimination of the Communist regime. It was very difficult for the American people to accept a situation in which their friends appeared to be frustrating such a possibility.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador indicated that he was quite aware of our feelings on this matter. He said that, if the issue over Guantanamo should become tense, it might be possible—and he was speaking only for him-self—that his Government could do something to stop the delivery of the buses. He would certainly take it up with his Government promptly.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had already warned the Prime Minister to be prepared for a full discussion of the matter next week, and he hoped that clarification might come out of that discussion.<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">

                        </list>
                        <p>I began the conversation by referring to articles which have appeared in the Soviet press accusing the United States of an act of piracy in connection with the seizure of some Cuban fishing boats. I pointed out that these articles stated that the boats were seized in international waters. I said that we were fully convinced and had good evidence that this was not the case. I said that when the boats were boarded, two of the Captains had said that they knew they were in United States waters and that one of the Captains had informed Havana by radio that he was in our national waters.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked when this message was sent, and I said I understood that it was at the time the vessels were apprehended. I said that moreover it appeared that this was a deliberate provocation as members of the crew had stated that they had been given a special briefing in which they were told that they were going on an historic mission. The Ambassador asked if these statements were made by the defectors, and I said I thought they were. He said that sometimes defectors had a tendency to say things which they thought would make them more welcome and valuable. I said that the action we were taking was in accordance with regular procedure followed by all countries and that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs action in cutting off the water supply at Guantanamo was completely unjustified. The Ambassador inquired why we had not simply ordered the boats to leave our waters. He said that he understood that this was in fact our first action and that we had then turned them over to the State of Florida. He quoted from the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> editorial to the effect that Florida was making foreign policy for the United States. He said he understood that the boats had not violated any Federal law.</p>
                        <p>I replied that this was not the case, that they had violated Federal as well as International Law, but that at the moment no Federal penalty <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0614"/>was provided for, although a bill was pending in Congress to do this. I said that another disturbing factor which made the Cuban action look like provocation was that the boats were fishing in an area where American boats were fishing and that their action had been observed by these vessels. I said that this also made it difficult for the Florida authorities not to carry out the provisions of Floridaʼs laws.</p>
                        <p>I went on to say that as he doubtless knew, we considered that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> was irresponsible and capable of dangerous actions. I said that this recent development took place against the background of a number of actions of interference by <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> in other countries of the Western Hemisphere and I mentioned specifically the arms cache which had been found in Venezuela and the fact that some of the mobs in Panama had been led by Panamanians trained in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the Czech Consul had informed the Soviet Consul that the Cubans had not been engaged in fishing in our waters. He said that some of the Captains had admitted that they were in United States waters but had come there to find quiet water in which to rest. I said our information was that they were fishing, or at least some of them were, but that we were checking this information.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked what we were going to do with the crews and the vessels. I said that I could not say for sure as we were still discussing the matter, but it was clear that the Captains would be tried in the Florida court. I said that I thought we would release the minor members of the crew at once and that it was possible that the other members of the crew would be released.</p>
                        <p>I concluded by pointing out that the Cuban situation was a delicate one and one which, if care were not exercised, could easily and quickly lead into a dangerous situation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed appreciation for my visit and said he hoped we, on our side, would handle matters in a way which would not make the situation any worse.</p>

                        <p>President: Yeah. I wanted to talk to you before I went into the meeting. Theyʼre meeting downstairs. Now hereʼs the—nobody wants to do much. They think that the first place these fishermen ought not even have been picked up, that it was a mistake. That they over the limits, but we ought to have told them to get on back home and not make a big incident out of it, because not anything to be gained from it, and we ought to let him show his hand, whether this is in concert with Khrushchev, and what all it means, before we act irrational. Thereʼs an opposing viewpoint, thatʼs pretty well the viewpoint of <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName>, and I would say, Bobby Kennedy. He wants to turn everybody loose and let them go on home. <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> feels like the sentiment in this country is such that weʼve got to do more than that, and that even though we would stand acquitted in the eyes of the world and maybe some of the liberal papers in this country, that we probably ought to do two things—declare the independence of that base by saying weʼre going to furnish our own water … and we donʼt want your damn water, and to hell with you. And number two, tell the people that are on there that they can pledge allegiance to us and live there, the 600. And the other 2500 to go on back and weʼre going to quit financing, weʼre going to operate the base independently so our country can be secure and so we operate it independently, and itʼs going to hurt you more by this action than hurts us, and we just donʼt need you people. Now thatʼs his feeling, heʼs about the only one that feels that way. Thatʼs my feeling, I think we ought to wrap ‘em up.</p>
                        <p>Russell: Thatʼs mine.</p>
                        <p>President: I think theyʼll say weʼre cruel, and these people been loyal to us for two or three generations, been working there, we just firing them outright without anything on their part, because <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> did <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0616"/>this. <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> thinks it will get a good deal of sympathy from the rest of the nations, and—</p>
                        <p>Russell: Well, thatʼs their professional attitude. These nations ainʼt as silly as we attribute them to be, as we seem to think they are. And while theyʼre envious as hell of us, when they get down to where their self interest is involved and when we get hurt, their self interest is injured, theyʼre not nearly as bad as everybody makes out like they are. This Panama thing will demonstrate that beyond any doubt, if our people will just sit tight, give them the facts, say here it is now, youʼve got a stake in this. Same thing is true here in Cuba, they donʼt want <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> to prosper, none of the leaders do, theyʼre thousands of the little people who are Communist do, but theyʼre not going to raise any hell about it. Khrushchev will blow up like hell. Comrade Mao Tse-tung will come in with a philippic of some kind, but the world as a whole will say well thatʼs very logical position to take. You got to know that you can protect this, and Khrushchev pulled them out all at once, which he could do, if heʼd stopped them all one morning, and youʼd hadnʼt even had an hourʼs notice, you would need them, but now youʼre giving yourself the hourʼs notice. And youʼre preparing against the probability that he would do another asinine thing by simply declaring that no Cuban national can enter on the base. Youʼve got to be ready for that. But I know—</p>
                        <p>President: What do you think? I donʼt like to see them so split, so divided State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. What do you think the attitude of the country is, the Senate? Are they indignant about cutting this water off. I donʼt guess as many of them feel as strong as Goldwater does, but I guess a good many of them feel—</p>
                        <p>Russell: No, they donʼt. But thereʼs a great many of them, they donʼt know exactly what they want done, Mr. President, because they donʼt know what can be done, but they want something done.</p>
                        <p>President: Thatʼs right, ainʼt much you can do, but this—Thatʼs right.</p>
                        <p>Russell: They donʼt know just exactly what to do. Theyʼre not in favor of any war, I donʼt think. I donʼt believe 10% of them would vote for that right now, under these circumstances. But theyʼre just tired of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> urinating on us and getting away with it. They donʼt like the smell of it any longer and they just want to sort of show that we are taking such steps as are within our power without involving the shedding of a lot of blood, thatʼs my analysis of the sentiment in the Congress. And I think in the country, course it would be mighty easy to whip them up to where theyʼd be ready to go to war over it if you cut loose, and banded it up, instead of playing it in low key like is being done, but I approve of the low key play, but I think thereʼs a latent feeling there, that it may not explode right now, but one of these days, <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0617"/>they are going to say, well weʼve just been a bunch of asses in this country, continually just back down and give away and say excuse me every time we come in collision with one of these little countries because theyʼre small and particularly Communist countries. And when that valve blows, now somebody is going to get hurt. And nobody will know just when the boiler is ready to give on it, but thereʼs a slowly increasing feeling in this country that weʼre not being as positive and as firm in our foreign relations as we should be, and that we just lean over backwards, that weʼre worried more about our image than we are about our substance, and that weʼre backing down. Now that feeling is in the country, just how far itʼs gotten, I donʼt know. A demagogue with any strength could blow it up. I donʼt know of anyone whoʼs got enough strength to do it, people donʼt trust Goldwaterʼs judgment, lot of them like his independence, and his—</p>
                        <p>President: You think a lot of people going to think youʼre hotheaded when you just fire a bunch of innocent humans.</p>
                        <p>Russell: I donʼt think so, I donʼt believe that even the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the Post could stir up 5% of the people about this. I would make it perfectly clear that this is regrettable, that our association with these people has been pleasant and mutually profitable over a period of years … but they were within the power of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and not in our power, and that we have to make this base independent, and we hope that in happier days, our pleasant relations with them could be renewed. Iʼd sure throw that in there, youʼll get every one of them where heʼd be a potential assassin to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. Yes, Iʼd certainly put it in there that way, that our relations with these people have been mutually pleasant and profitable, that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, he had control of them. He could stop them any morning, and not a one of them could come and we couldnʼt afford to be placed in that uncertain position. We had to rely on our resources.</p>
                        <p>President: If heʼs going to cut off our water, tomorrow he can cut off our people.</p>
                        <p>Russell: Pardon?</p>
                        <p>President: If today he can cut off our water, tomorrow he can cut off our people.</p>
                        <p>Russell: Sure, sure. He can stop them everyone at the gate, where not one could come in without a momentʼs notice. We just we canʼt operate that important establishment in the unpleasant atmosphere, and as regrettable as it is weʼll have to make other arrangements for the time being, and hope that in better days when the Cuban people and the American people are permitted to fraternize as they have in the past, and as we are anxious to do today, that we hope to be able to renew this.</p>
                        <p>President: Iʼd planned. I think Iʼm going to make some kind of a statement on it, at least authorize the press to, after we have our meeting <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0618"/>this afternoon,<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2">At a 6:35 news conference that evening, Press Secretary Pierre Salinger read a White House statement indicating that the President had instructed the Department of Defense to make the Guantanamo base self-sufficient. The statement cited that “the reckless and irresponsible conduct of the Cuban Government,” remained a threat to peace and warned against “further provocations.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.

                        <p>Russell: I think youʼre going to have to say something.</p>
                        <p>President: Then I think Iʼm going home for the weekend. Do you see any reason why I shouldnʼt?</p>

                        <p>Russell: I agree, donʼt think thereʼs any reason why you should.</p>

Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> commenced with a briefing of the facts which had been established as follows: First, Cuban public statements, press releases and broadcasts have in the last ten days featured the Guantanamo issue. Second, the Cuban ships were fishing in our territorial waters on February 2nd and there were fish aboard of the type caught in these waters. Third, there was no absolute evidence that the <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0619"/>ships were dispatched or directed to national waters as against having been directed into traditional United States fishing grounds. Fourth, Cuban authorities <hi rend="italic">were</hi> advised that the ships were in U.S. national waters at the time they were seized. Fifth, it should be noted that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs actions regarding the Guantanamo water supply took place four days after the ships were apprehended which raises some question as to whether Guantanamo was a part of the original plan.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Mac Bundy</persName> stated that the easiest part of the decision to be reached concerned the Florida legal problem. After hearing Mekerʼs briefing, the President agreed that the matter should be handled by the Florida courts as being in the nature of a first offense; that the crews would be released under temporary custody of Immigration and not fined; that the captains should be fined and that there should be no forfeiture of the vessels.</item>

                            <item>On the question of Guantanamo and measures to be taken in response to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs act, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said that the choices had narrowed down to alternatives one and two as set forth in the proposed releases.<note n="3" xml:id="d235fn3">At 6:30 p.m. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> called Senator Russell to discuss the wording of the statement to be issued that evening and the differences between the Presidentʼs advisers over two different alternatives and proposed releases. The President read virtually the entire statement to Russell and noted that <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> had disagreed with him and suggested an alternative statement which proposed that the President instruct the Department of Defense to make the Base “wholly sufficient in fresh water” and to prepare other measures to make it secure. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said, “but to do nothing about it [the employees], you see, just to prepare.” Russell said “I much prefer the first one, I think that the people will too.” The President then said that <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> thought that the rest of the Hemisphere was watching “and if we get soft with them, weʼll be soft with Panama and that everybody else will start kicking us in the pants cause theyʼll think they can.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Richard Russell, Tape F64.12, Side A, PNO 1)</note> The argument centered around the question of the Base employees and the lines were quite clearly drawn. The Secretary of Defense strongly favored the dismissal of employees on the ground that only by this act could the Base be made “secure.” General Taylor on balance supported the Secretary of Defense. Mr. Nitze on close balance favored not dismissing the employees but did not re-state his position in the later stage of the argument. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested a compromise which would put special emphasis on the dollar contribution to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> made by the Base wages.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The Attorney General repeated his very strong objection to the dismissal of the Base employees on the grounds that (a) it was an overreaction to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs move and (b) it hurt the wrong Cubans who by and large had been loyal Base employees, some for more than a generation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> also opposed the dismissal on these grounds plus the fact that other countries in which we have bases might fear a similar <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0620"/>action in the event of a disagreement with them. He also pointed out that our annual rental for Guantanamo is $3,000. Without the economic benefits of the Base salaries, this rental figure will stand out and weaken our Guantanamo position. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Mac Bundy</persName> stated that from the point of view of domestic reaction (which he said would be bad) there was little to choose between the two alternatives and that he favored alternative two.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>The President clearly showed that he leaned toward alternative one, mainly on the ground of Base security. The argument went around again with <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Wilson</persName> voting for alternative two and the Secretary of State for alternative one with certain word changes. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Mac Bundy</persName> at this point made a heated defense of alternative two.</item>

                            <item>Mr. Sorensen said that the course of the argument had indicated to him that neither alternative was adequate under the circumstances.</item>

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> pointed out that a recent report had indicated that Cuban training in SAM operations has now entered a new phase wherein Cuban trainees are regularly passing target tracking information. It was agreed that, in view of the fact that this might presage early Cuban control of the SAM installations, there should be an early review of plans for military retaliation.)</item>

                        <p>President: What Iʼm worried about, thereʼs one thing that worries me about the whole thing. I think theyʼll demonstrate and raise hell, and all that Iʼm prepared for, but the one thing that I thought was the word reduce, that doesnʼt mean anything to me. I would say discontinue, and I donʼt think it means a damn thing to say reduce, <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0621"/>and I hope somebody doesnʼt pick that up and go picking at us. But if they do, I think that weʼve got to say that our intention is to get rid of the people who are under his control, who donʼt want to live on the base, and who are going to take their money and finance <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: What we mean in other words is to make this program effective, but not to state it in a provocative way.</p>
                        <p>President: Thatʼs right, what we mean is to discontinue.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>: Yep.</p>
                        <p>President: Get rid of these people, and because if Goldwater gets ahold of it, heʼll say, why hell, he said he was going to reduce, he doesnʼt have to take but a half dozen of them, and thatʼs a reduction.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Well, he tried to call, he didnʼt get them all, but frankly they were for the hardest possible line. LeMay wanted to go in and bomb the place and Max told me on the way over, driving over this afternoon, that he felt the Chiefs would prefer alternative one, they hadnʼt actually seen it in that form, but thatʼs what he thought they would prefer. When you asked him to call, he tried to call, he got one <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0622"/>or two, he didnʼt get them all. But I think we can safely say they would prefer one or two. I didnʼt tell you at the meeting, because I didnʼt want to interject it in the conversation but I called Russell as you asked me to and he would prefer alternative one.</p>
                        <p>President: Yeah. I knew that. There was one thing that worries me. I think one is all right except for that word reduce.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Well, I agree with you. I would have much preferred discontinue.</p>
                        <p>President: We probably just ought to put discontinue in regardless what they said. I just didnʼt want—<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had gone along with us and I didnʼt want to have a fight with him, but in doing it now—you reduce them or put them on that base, I mean discontinue them or put them on the base.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Yeah. Iʼm sending people down there tonight. Theyʼll get plans and bring it back here, then weʼll get it moving on it.</p>
                        <p>President: Now do you think weʼre going to have some static with the press on this thing, you think some of our own crowd will be building it up.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: I donʼt think so. I donʼt think we will. I hope we donʼt have any.</p>
                        <p>President: Why donʼt you meet with some of the press tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: I can do that.</p>
                        <p>President: Iʼd background them and have Taylor in there with you and tell them, give them a little the dangerous side if they continue, if this guy can cut you off, your water, he can cut you off your people, and youʼve got to have security at these bases, so that, so that they think weʼve done enough. Now my real concern, Bob, is that theyʼre going to think we havenʼt done anything.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: Well, that was my concern, thatʼs why I wanted to get away from two onto one. I agree with you. I think thatʼs the real danger in this country.</p>
                        <p>President: But I couldnʼt understand <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName>. Heʼs pretty hard nosed, and I just couldnʼt find out where he was.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: I couldnʼt either. I just told somebody here that when I find myself being accused by <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> as over-reacting, I really begin to wonder.</p>
                        <p>President: Maybe we better go back to Ford. Will you take me with you.</p>
                        <p>President and <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>: [laughter]</p>
                        <p>President: Goodbye, thank you. Iʼm going to leave now. Iʼve lost a real good friend. Iʼve got to go to a funeral. But I want you to take care of things while Iʼm gone.</p>

                        <p>Request <persName corresp="#p_SEA1">Stadelhofer</persName> present following note immediately to Foreign Office:</p>
                        <p>The United States Government has been informed through the Swiss Government of the note which was given the Swiss Ambassador in Havana at 11:15 AM on February 6 and which stated that as of 12:00 Noon of that same day the furnishing of water to the Naval Base at Guantanamo would be suspended and that the suspension would be maintained until the Cuban fishermen at present under detention in the United States were put at liberty.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in the note which the United States Government sent to the Government of Cuba through the Swiss Government on February 4, 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d238fn2">See <ref target="#d228">Document 228</ref>.</note> the four Cuban fishing boats were apprehended within the territorial sea of the United States off East Key in the Dry Tortugas. Further confirmation of this fact is to be found in the testimony of two of the masters of the Cuban fishing boats—Jose Manuel Ventura of the <hi rend="italic">Cardenas</hi> No. 14 and Manuel Gomez Barrios of the <hi rend="italic">Lambda</hi> No. <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0624"/>8—who have admitted to United States Coast Guard officials that they were knowingly fishing in United States waters. Furthermore a monitored conversation between the <hi rend="italic">Lambda</hi> No. 33 and the control station in Havana which took place at 2:25 p.m. on February 2 read as follows:
<list>
                                <item>Havana: Where are you anchored?</item>
                                <item>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Lambda</hi> 33: Well, we are east of Tortugas. Go ahead</item>
                                <item>Havana: International waters?</item>
                                <item>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Lambda</hi> 33: Well no, this is national water, national water</item>
                                <item>Havana: I understand</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>From the foregoing it is clear that, first, the Cuban fishing vessels knew they were fishing inside the territorial sea of the United States and, second, that the Cuban authorities in Havana were also aware of this fact.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the clear violation of international law and of the laws of the United States represented by the illegal fishing of the Cuban vessels in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> territorial waters, the Government of Cuba has no justification whatsoever for the arbitrary and irresponsible act of suspending water service to the Guantanamo Naval Base in direct violation of the existing contract between the water company and the Base which runs until 1969.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States protests in vigorous terms this totally unwarranted action and wishes to point out to the Government of Cuba that there can be no relationship whatsoever between measures taken by the Government of the United States against persons who have violated its laws and the unjustified suspension of water service to the Naval Base by the Cuban Government. Any effort to do so is entirely inadmissible to the Government of the United States. Thus the case of the Cuban nationals apprehended illegally fishing in United States territorial waters will proceed under the full guarantees for a fair trial by the State of Florida.</p>

                        <p rend="center">FREE WORLD TRADE WITH CUBA—SOME<lb/>PRELIMINARY RUMINATIONS</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Our objective is twofold. First, for obvious reasons, we want to cut down Free World export of critical commodities to Cuba. Second, we want to hold down or cut down the <hi rend="italic">level</hi> of Free World trade with Cuba. This reduction of Free World/Cuban commercial contacts is consistent with our overall isolation policy. Also, it is probably important for other reasons that the level of Free World/Cuban trade (even in non-critical commodities) does not rise precipitously during 1964.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Probably the most effective way of achieving this dual objective is to bring about a situation whereby the American business community would not trade with anyone trading with Cuba. Cuba has only 6 million people and, as a result, a businessman, contemplating trade with Cuba, will think long and hard before he cuts himself off from the huge American market for the sake of the small Cuban market. If a couple Latin American countries joined the U.S. effort, the action would be even more effective. It is conceivable that such action, which is based on the self-interest motive of Free World traders, would make superfluous other steps in this field.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>There appear to be three ways in which we can bring about the situation whereby the American business community would not trade with anyone in the Cuban trade. First, we could invoke the Trading with the Enemy Act to legally prohibit Americans from doing business with anyone who trades with Cuba. Second, we could make our desires known to the American business community and urge them to voluntarily cut off commercial dealings with persons trading with Cuba. Third, we could use a combination of the above two methods (e.g. We tell business leaders—“The Government is willing to take step X. Will you be willing to take step Y in order to close the circle?”).</item>
                            <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0626"/>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Probably the most effective program would depend largely on the Trading with the Enemy Act, under which we could announce that we intend to blacklist any foreign firm which trades with Cuba after a certain date. If we take this route, we may have to or want to provide loopholes (which, reportedly, is possible). For example: (a) We would undoubtedly make an exception for those firms which export food and drugs to Cuba since our own traders are allowed to do this. (b) Until the world sugar situation loosens, we may want to make an exception for those firms which import Cuban sugar (however, they would pay for it in foreign exchange). (c) We may find that a relatively few Free World firms make up a large part of the Free Worldʼs trade with Cuba and that it is not worthwhile or effective to blacklist Free World firms which trade in small quantities of noncritical items.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Probably the biggest obstacles to the blacklisting action would be the reaction of Free World (particularly Western European) governments.
<list>
                                    <label>(a)</label>
                                    <item>Free World governments would certainly point to the violation of free trading principles (e.g. GATT and all that) and might conceivably retaliate against U.S. exporters. They would undoubtedly point out that they are forced into two-way Cuban trade involuntarily—because of the world-wide shortage of sugar.</item>
                                    <label>(b)</label>
                                    <item>Our response to Free World governments could include such points as the following: <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, while we also believe in the principles of free trade, there are overriding national security considerations in this case. Cuban actions in autumn, 1962 and Cubaʼs recent participation in fomenting subversion in Venezuela, Panama, and Zanzibar make it eminently clear that we are dealing with a particularly nasty, hostile power; the U.S. intends to treat Cuba as one. (It is true that there are other hostile powers which we do not attempt to isolate. Our actions are designed to fit the case and, inter alia, Cubaʼs unique geographic position makes an isolation policy an effective and appropriate response. As evidence of its impact, note how hard the Cubans and the Soviets are working to break it.) <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, we are certainly not taking our action precipitously. We have tried strenuously over the past few years to gain Free World cooperation through persuasion rather than sanction. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, the sacrifice we are asking for, in real terms, is not great. For example, the <hi rend="italic">total</hi> of Free World exports to Cuba, divided up between many countries and firms, only amounted to a little more than $100 million in each of the last two years. Generally speaking, no one, except Cuba, is going to hurt very much, even if Cuban sugar is paid for in foreign exchange.</item>
                                    <label>(c)</label>
                                    <item>There may be a variety of factors which may mitigate (at least privately) a vociferous response by affected Free World governments. <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, by now, they are pretty accustomed to our “extreme” behavior <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0627"/>when it comes to Cuba. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, we have been hounding Free World governments about the subject for a long time now; they will probably be only half-surprised when we finally do something decisive about it. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, in real terms, no Free World country will suffer if it cuts itself off from Cuban trade. <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, Free World governments who sympathize with our objectives but who are unable to control their traders effectively, may secretly welcome action which takes the <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> out of their hands.</item>
                                </list>
                            </item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Generally speaking, American business firms are unlikely to resist the proposed action. They would appear to lose little in concrete terms.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>There are some arguments in favor of taking action quickly if we are going to take it. <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, we might want to take advantage of the atmosphere generated by Venezuela, Panama, Zanzibar, and Guantanamo. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, we might want to act before the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> discusses Rio Treaty action against Cuba because of the arms cache discovery. We would then be in a good position to ask all or some of the OARʼs to take similar measures (e.g. Venezuela). <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, there are indications that Free World/Cuban trade has hit bottom and is beginning to rise. The longer we wait, the more resistance we are likely to meet as vested interests increase along with the trade.</item>

                            <item>Tell the President (and I cannot stress this too strongly) that I seriously hope that Cuba and the United States can eventually sit down in an atmosphere of good will and of mutual respect and negotiate our differences. I believe that there are <hi rend="italic">no</hi> areas of contention between us that cannot be discussed and settled within a climate of mutual understanding. But first, of course, it is necessary to <hi rend="italic">discuss</hi> our differences. I now believe that this hostility between Cuba and the United States is both unnatural and unnecessary—and it can be eliminated.</item>

Such an interpretation would be a serious miscalculation. We are not weak … the Revolution is strong … very strong. Nothing, absolutely nothing that the United States can do will destroy the Revolution. Yes, we are strong. And it is from this position of strength that we wish to resolve our differences with the United States and to live in peace with all the nations of the world.</item>

                        <p>The President asked the Secretary to speak about sanctions on Cuba. He said that he had gone into the matter thoroughly with the Prime Minister in the morning,<note n="2" xml:id="d241fn2">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_DSA1">Douglas-Home</persName> at the White House at 11 a.m. that morning. (Ibid.)</note> and that the Prime Minister was willing to help, but had problems of his own. The President emphasized that we understand the British position, and have our own problems in the situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary opened by saying that trade within the Western Hemisphere with Cuba is now down to a rather low level, and includes no industrial trade, primarily because the hemisphere is concerned over <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> subversion efforts. We want measures to make the industrial situation in Cuba grind to a halt. There has been a 60% reduction in free-world shipping to Cuba, but it is still very substantial. We are also concerned over means of transportation, electrical equipment, spare parts <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0630"/>and mining equipment. There was a little discussion of the number of British ships in the trade, with general agreement that about one-third of free-world ships in the trade are British.<note n="3" xml:id="d241fn3">According to a January 24 memorandum of conversation among <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, and the British Ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that “he felt it was necessary for the British to know that rightly or wrongly their sale of buses to Cuba was regarded in the United States as interference with a well-advertised U.S. policy.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> added that “It should be remembered that Bristol was also discussing a $37 million contract with the United States. Companies were not going to trade both with the United States and Cuba.” (Ibid., January, 1964)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the matter of trade with Cuba had been discussed with the Japanese, who are buying some 300,000 tons of sugar from Cuba, but who are in return sending drugs and textiles, and as little electrical or industrial equipment as possible.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say this was not simply a trade matter but one of security of the hemisphere. He said the overflights are continuing, the SAMs are increasingly under Cuban control, arms are being shipped to Venezuela, and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> people can hit the government on a very touchy nerve. This can erode the strength of support in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> for the NATO relationship. Cuba and Peiping are both of such a nature that they can have this effect on American opinion. We believe that our NATO allies need to see this matter as a security problem. In general, our cooperation has been good. Trade control must be economic or it does not work. We have taken every step possible short of war, and we have applied pressure of all kinds. If additional steps are required, the only ones possible are likely to be acts of violence. We do not wish to think about this until we have explored all non-violent means.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he fully understood the political problems Cuba presented for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. The British have tried to use economic sanctions in the past, and feel that they do not work. The British are not giving credit outside ordinary commercial coverage. The UK lives by trade and if the UK refused such transactions as the bus deal, the French would immediately take the business. If the government went to the House of Commons with a proposal to support the kind of measures the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is using, there would be severe criticism of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and of the government for giving in to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> opinion. If British firms trading with Cuba are in danger in terms of their <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> contacts, this is another matter, but government policy must be clear. Some ships are British by flag, but the owners live somewhere else, and are mostly Greek. The Prime Minister said that the British Government would get at the ship owners again, but as a government it could not cut off trade. Mr. Butler added that the government would take another look at the credit matter.</p>
                        <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0631"/>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested the British might wish to look at their own attitude toward Venezuela, Mexico and other free countries in the vicinity of Cuba which are seriously concerned over <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> subversion. Perhaps the British could tell the Cubans that they could give government guarantees on exports only as long as Cuba is not injuring its neighbors who have good relations with the UK.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said of course he realized the Cubans were up to various kinds of monkey business in Latin America but the Russians were up to monkey business throughout the world. He wondered if the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> really thought that it was going to bring down <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> by economic pressure. Wouldnʼt he be more likely to tighten his belt and bear up heroically as a national leader. The Secretary responded by saying that if the Cuban economy was a shambles, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> would not spend as much on ventures outside of Cuba. If <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> is not going to go away, and is to remain as a real threat, policies have to be devised to deal with this eventuality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said that we did not engage in economic warfare with the Soviet Union. We sell wheat to the Soviet Union, which is of marginal importance to that large economy. The Cuban economy however is in bad shape, and will not last forever in terms of the internal stresses. We canʼt very well say that we know it wonʼt work, even though making it work is difficult.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Butler said that British trade is very small, having fallen from an annual average of about £12 million to about £1.9 million. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> wondered if we could talk about things which are in specific short supply in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the people on the UK side should know that it is not <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs beard, or his organization of Cuba, that we object to. What we do object to, and what are not negotiable, are (a) the military connection with Moscow and (b) the interference in the hemisphere. If <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> realizes this, and accepts it, he can perfectly well negotiate his way back into the hemisphere. The Prime Minister wondered if there was any possibility of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> approaching the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to talk about it. The Secretary said there were once three schools of thought in Cuba, one favoring Moscow, one favoring Peiping and one Titoist. He said he had seen no significant evidence of an effort to rejoin the hemisphere. Ambassador Ormsby Gore wondered if the Titoist policy would be consistent with membership in the hemisphere. The Secretary said that a Titoist policy, meaning Tito at his best, would open up a different situation, but this might take some time.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said the whole thing was extremely difficult. He said that his government might talk to firms, might indicate that they could lose <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> business. He promised further to watch the situation on credits, and he noted that export guarantees are a type of <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0632"/>insurance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said they were about the same as we give on Soviet wheat sales. The Secretary wondered if British firms would trade without credit, and the Prime Minister said they would if Cuba paid cash. The President inquired concerning the trend of British trade with Cuba. Mr. Butler said that it had fallen to £1.9 million in 1963, but he conceded that it was now going up. He observed that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> trade in 1963 was about £12 million. He wondered what accounted for this size. The Secretary said the biggest item was food and drugs connected with the prisoner exchange. Trade also included payment for water, and the wages of Cubans working at Guantanamo, and both of these were not being reduced. The Prime Minister returned to the problem of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs status in Cuba, wondering if <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> could be repudiated by the people. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said the regime was not responsible to the people, but the ruling group might split, and control by other elements might be possible.</p>

                        <p>During the past two months there have been major compromises of our efforts to reduce trade between the free world and Cuba. These breaches have made it clear that our present tactics of relying essentially on diplomatic persuasion are not adequate.</p>

                                <item>A proclaimed list barring U.S. citizens from any business or financial transactions with foreign firms trading with Cuba<note n="2" xml:id="d242fn2">According to the memorandum for the record of this February 19 meeting at 5 p.m., drafted on February 22, several of the participants felt that one stumbling block to the proclaimed list appeared to be an impossible hurdle, i.e., how could Free World firms be blacklisted while Soviet Bloc ones were not? On the one hand, the U.S. Government was pursuing measures designed to lessen tensions with the Soviet Bloc and to draw these countries closer to the West. On the other, if the blacklist procedures were not employed against the Bloc and Yugoslavia, then the United States would be open to the charge that it was punishing its friends but not the Communists. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Cuba, <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Resolution (Arms Cache), Vol. II, Memos, 11/63–9/64)</note> and freezing the U.S. assets of such firms; or</item>

                                <item>A variety of partial measures, either singly or together, such as a denial of government contracts to traders with Cuba and private boycotts.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although a significant amount of trade between Cuba and the free world would occur despite the establishment of a proclaimed list, the action would almost certainly be much more effective than any other measure or combination of measures we might employ. The fundamental question regarding a proclaimed list is whether we are prepared to endure the very real political costs that would result from its establishment and whether we would also be prepared to incur the risk of retaliation that might be directed against either United States commercial interests or the government itself.</p>
                        <p>Our problem is made more difficult by the probable necessity of a waiver for Spain under Section 620(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act<note n="3" xml:id="d242fn3">Section 620(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of September 4, 1961 (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 87–195), as amended by Public Law 87–872 on October 23, 1962, prohibited economic and military assistance to countries whose ships and aircraft transported merchandise to Cuba. The amended act authorized the President to waive the provisions penalizing such countries if he found it in the national interest to do so. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> chose not to waive the actʼs provisions in the cases of Britain, France, and Yugoslavia, and in mid-February the Department of State announced that all assistance to them was terminated. The administration also suspended new aid commitments to Spain and Morocco, in the hope that they could be weaned from trade with Cuba.</note>
                            <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0634"/>because of the great importance of our bases there. The concession of the waiver will encourage Spanish-Cuban trade, but beyond that other free-world countries will exploit the waiver to justify their own economic activities toward Cuba. Furthermore, the waiver will be incongruent with and harmful to our attempts to obtain forward action from the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> in the economic and anti-subversion sectors.</p>
                        <p>The prospect of the signing of a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–USSR civil aviation agreement poses another serious issue for our Cuban policies and illustrates, as in the case of the Spanish waiver, the sharp conflict between apparently irreconcilable major objectives. The policy choice we face is between:

                                <p>It has become clear that the United States Government must either change its methods of restricting free-world trade with Cuba or accept the probability of a significant increase in this trade, with all its consequences. Our present tactics of relying essentially on diplomatic persuasion, reinforced by pressures on free-world firms trading with Cuba by their American associates and occasional small-scale preclusive purchases, have not prevented major breaches in our efforts to isolate Cuba. Key free-world governments have flatly refused to cooperate with our policy, even when approached at the highest level, and we are suffering successive losses. If we are to continue to try to arrest and turn back the trend in Cuban-free-world trade, we must turn our pressures more directly against the commercial interests of the trading firms, essentially making them choose between trade with Cuba or trade with the United States.</p>

                                <p>In 1963 Cuban exports to the free world may have amounted to about $190 million, while imports were probably about $115 million, a total of around $300 million. During the year Cuba also increased its foreign exchange holdings from about $20 million to approximately $75–100 million.</p>

                        <p>Cubaʼs exports to and imports from the free world would each amount to about $260 million, for a total of about $520 million, an increase of nearly 75 percent over 1963.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, a decrease in sugar prices or Cuban inability to export as much as 1.4 million tons of sugar to the free world could lower the export earnings and perhaps the total trade figure. On the other hand, if free-world suppliers were willing to extend large-scale credits to Cuba, then Cubaʼs imports from and total trade with the free world could use above the $260 million and $520 million estimates.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the impact that any increase in free world-Cuban trade would have on the Cuban economy, much depends, of course, on how Cuba allocates its foreign exchange holdings and how wisely it employs the goods it does import. A conservative assessment, however, would have to assume increasing Cuban competence in such matters. Significantly increased imports of commodities critical to the Cuban economy could provide the crucial margin between a wallowing economy and one showing satisfactory growth.</p>

                            <item>In 1963, Free World ships made 371 trips to Cuba. This represents roughly a 60% reduction from the 1962 level of Free World shipping to Cuba.</item>

                            <item>The prospects for further reduction in 1964 are fairly bright. In 1963, the Greeks, Lebanese, and British were the primary shippers. For all practical purposes, the Greeks have now left the trade. A Lebanese law is expected to become effective in mid-March which should eliminate many Lebanese ships during 1964. We have made very little headway with HMG, but a U.S. deal with the biggest shipper in the British trade (Mavroleon) is expected to result in a substantial reduction in the British ships by the end of 1964. Thus, the shipping figures in 1964 should be even lower than in 1963; this of course assumes that we can prevent other Free World ships from picking up the slack which we expect the Greeks, Lebanese, and Mavroleon to leave.</item>

Estimates indicate that when all the statistics are in, Free World trade with Cuba in 1963 will amount to roughly $250–$320 million; exports to Cuba are expected to remain the same at roughly $115 million while imports are expected to jump to $190 million. A table is attached which shows the primary Free World traders in 1962 and 1963.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The prospects for 1964 are not at all good. Assuming we generally continue on our present course, and take no further concrete steps to restrict trade (e.g. the drastic proclaimed list action), it is estimated that total Free World trade with Cuba could amount to roughly $520 million, an increase of nearly 75% over 1963. This, of course, could vary. For example, if sugar prices drop below the estimated 8¢ per pound, then the value of Free World/Cuba trade in 1964 could be less than $520 million. On the other hand, the value of Free World/Cuba trade in 1964 could be more than $520 million if Free World countries extend large-scale credits to Cuba, or if the Bloc, anxious to break our isolation policy, decides to give foreign exchange to Cuba for purchases in the Free World.</item>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> commented briefly on Cuban relations during a long telephone call that he placed to Senator Russell on February 26, 1964. He said, in part: “<persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Tom Mann</persName> thinks weʼre stronger in the Hemisphere today than we were 90 days ago, because of what weʼve done in Panama and what weʼve done in Cuba. He thinks weʼre in worse shape than weʼve been in 20 years and that the Hemisphere is in a very dangerous position. But he thinks that these two little insignificant moves have let them know that ‘donʼt tread on me.’ And he thought they needed to know that pretty much.”</p>
                        <p>Later in the conversation <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> had talked during one of his interviews about wanting to turn the water back on at Guantanamo. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> summarized <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs position as being “that heʼs not going to cause any real trouble and he wants Guantanamo, but he wants it peacefully.” The President tied this to “when we fired 500 the first damned day, every one of them went to bellyaching to him that they lost their jobs.”</p>
                        <p>In concluding about Cuba, <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that Guantanamo had had “over 300 known subversives” and that he had “told the Admiral down there” that he would “try to do something about it.” The President then said: “But I give up. Whenever I hit the Department of Defense or the Department of State, itʼs like a man trying to punch his way through a big thick mattress. You just canʼt do it. You hit it and the damned thing gives when you hit—the bed bounces back out.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of telephone conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Richard Russell, February 26, 1964, 12:10 p.m., Tape F64.14, Side B, PNO 1) The portions of the conversation printed here were prepared in the Office of the Historian specifically for this volume.</p>

(<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Intelligence Briefings, 1/64–12/64)</note> This item refers to the withdrawal of the Soviets from Cuba and the turning over of the SAM sites to them. I said there was a high probability that the SAM sites would be placed in the hands of the Cubans who would have absolute control over them. I said that other evidence convinced us there would be a continuing withdrawal of Soviets from Cuba, but not a total withdrawal; however we could not gauge the exact numbers. I said that this, in my opinion, represented probably the next important crisis that we would face because <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> in his rather amicable but long press conference had raised the question of our penetrating illegally Cuban air space. I therefore recommended that this subject be discussed with Secretaries of State and Defense; that they be ordered to prepare contingency plans for such a situation, otherwise we would be confronted with an emergency, all the lights in town would be on, and our course of action would have to evolve under an atmosphere of emergency. I pressed this point hard. The President asked if I had discussed it with <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and I told him I had, on two occasions, but they seemed wholly preoccupied with the problem at hand and had never come to grips with this particular hypothetical but possible situation. The President gave me no satisfactory answer as to any action he would take. In fact, he seemed more preoccupied with the withdrawal of Soviets and the “numbers remaining” than he did with the issue I was confronting him with.</p>

He went on to say that the Secretary has taken personal charge of the matter and may not want to carry the reduction beyond 1000 commuters—a figure which the President and he apparently agreed upon originally, at the time of the water crisis. The Secretary may be under some pressure from the Navy which argues (a) that a further reduction of commuters high-lights the erosion of our position in Guantanamo; (b) that the release of faithful employees is a tough moral, humanitarian problem, and gives <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> propaganda ammunition; and (c) that there is a practical difficulty in replacing them.</item>

                        <p>The following are additional notes on the discussion at the Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting with the President on March 4, 1964 on Cuba, Vietnam and various related subjects.</p>
                        <p>In the briefing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff discussed the operational plans on Cuba and pointed out the various time factors involved—72 hours—7 days—18 days—and the sizes of the forces available in each of these time elements.</p>
                        <p>The Chiefs emphasized that one of the factors is shipping and that the longest time element involves getting troops from Fort Hood to the East Coast and the Marines from the West Coast through the Canal and to the East Coast for reembarkation.</p>
                        <p>In this discussion, the Chiefs reviewed the actions of October 1962. Much questioning by the President concerned the strategy involved and the various possibilities.</p>
                        <p>As an end result of this, the President directed the Joint Chiefs to give him a list, made up by themselves, of everything they think <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0642"/>we can do that we are not now doing to put further pressure on Cuba.</p>
                        <p>In the discussion of Cuba there was mention of a joint resolution by Congress which would give the President a quasi-legal position for expanding the efforts. As he understood it, this joint resolution was to be based on an acknowledgment that the activities of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> had taken on a new and different kind of threat to this hemisphere—not a security threat against the U.S. directly, but because of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs training of Cuban and Communist agitators and exporting them to other countries, he is posing a long-range threat to the stability and security of Latin America. On these grounds, he was posing a new threat which people around the world could recognize. Discussion of this resolution was not terminated precisely, but the Presidential reaction appeared to be included in his discussion and reaction to the proposal of a joint resolution by Congress concerning the war in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban discussion also led to a discussion of a blockade and the difference between a quarantine which we held in October 1962 and a real blockade, including the halting of Russian shipping, and especially the stoppage of petroleum ships. It was indicated that the Joint Chiefs should discuss this possibility in conjunction with everything we can do that we are not doing.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion of Vietnam. For a memorandum of conversation prepared by Maxwell Taylor, see <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d70">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, volume I, Document 70</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>My concluding impression of this long discussion on Cuba and South Vietnam was that the President requested urgently that the Joint Chiefs give him their very best military advice in the form of two lists of action that could be taken—one for Cuba and one for the Southeast Asia area, and from what he had heard in the discussion, he was willing to accept their judgments, and, in a sense, was now setting out upon this course of activity which they had outlined verbally.</p>
                        <p>In turn, the President expected their 100% support of the actions agreed upon and a cessation (on the part of everyone) of forecasting and discussing in public what we intend to do. He emphasized this point with the comparison to the Normandy operation, pointing out how difficult and impossible it would have been for General Eisenhower to succeed if everything we were planning had been discussed by government officials, including State Department and military officials, before they even staged the landings.</p>

                        <p>We have one extremely (attached) interesting and disturbing intelligence report<note n="2" xml:id="d248fn2">Not attached.

(Ibid., Intelligence, Vol. I, 11/63–11/64)</note> to the effect that when <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> heard about the fishing boat incident, one of the things he thought of doing was to shoot down one of our U–2 planes in retaliation. This report underlines the fact that the surface-to-air missiles in Cuba are coming increasingly under Cuban and not Russian control, and that there is therefore a need to take measures to warn <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and his Russian friends once more on the dangers of interference with our regular high-level surveillance.

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Mac</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Dick Helms and I are most appreciative of the opportunity you gave us this morning for a thorough discussion of the Agencyʼs various operational problems in connection with Cuba. It was very helpful to us and has served to clarify to a great extent our own thinking on the future of our various operational programs. It might perhaps be well to set forth, in this informal fashion, a list of the various topics which we discussed together with the considerations that appear to me to apply.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, as you know very well, although the Agency appears as the proposer of most covert action programs at the Special Group and elsewhere, we do this only in response to what we understand to be policy requirements and have no interest in either commencing or perpetuating any programs which are not demanded by policy and which are not geared to the accomplishment of a specific objective. The interdependent program of actions which we proposed last spring and which was accepted in June<note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2">For text of the proposed program of action, see <ref target="frus1961-63v11#d346">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. XI, Document 346</ref>.</note> was based on three propositions which were accepted at the time: (a) that it was in the U.S. interest to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>; (b) that, in attempting to do so, the U.S. did not wish either to employ overt force or to raise the international “noise level” to an unacceptable degree; and (c) that the ultimate objective of the program was not mass uprisings but to encourage disaffected elements within the military establishment and other power centers of the regime to carry out a coup.</p>
                        <p>The resulting program represented a maximum covert effort but only a minimum overall national effort which <hi rend="italic">could</hi> result in overthrowing <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. The percentage of chance of achieving this purpose was admittedly never too high even had the program proceeded on full blower. In fact the economic part of the program suffered a serious, if not fatal, reverse with the Leyland bus contract and subsequent moves by European suppliers to take advantage of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs improved cash position. The sabotage raids, built into the program as a sort of <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0645"/>firing pin for internal unrest and to create the conditions for a coup, which was to be the main force leading to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs defeat, ran only from August to December and only five were actually conducted. The effectiveness of these five raids is certainly debatable; there are strong proponents on both sides of the argument. Regardless of how that debate might come out, however, five rather low-key raids followed by the present three-month hiatus, the latter clearly noted by pro- and anti-Castroites alike, adds up to a program of a much smaller dimension than originally envisioned which could not be expected to have had the desired detonating effect.</p>
                        <p>At the present time, as a result of a number of circumstances well known to you, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> is in a strong upswing and the spirit of resistance within Cuba is at a very low point indeed. In my estimation, a covert program at this time designed to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> is not realistic. Acceptance of risks and noise level of a greater magnitude than we had in mind in June would be needed to stand a chance in view of the developments since last June. This then raises the question of what should happen now to the various bits and pieces of the June program. I would like to mention these separately and refer to some of the considerations typical to each.</p>
                        <p>The sabotage raids are conducted by Cuban exile groups held and trained in Florida and entirely subject to our planning and control. There are three of these groups totaling approximately 50 men. To place them in position and recover them there requires an extensive maritime apparatus in Florida, which likewise serves intelligence agent infiltrations and exfiltrations. To maintain the raiding capability on a stand-by basis is expensive but, more importantly, the raiding groups themselves have a relatively short shelf life; if not employed their morale deteriorates and some of the members, usually the best motivated, drop out. Replacements can be acquired and trained but their caliber and morale is in large part determined by the morale of the exile community as a whole. We probably can retain the present raiding groups at roughly their current capabilities for another month or two, although the well-known Cuban volatility is capable of causing sudden and more rapid deterioration.</p>
                        <p>In short, we will need to know within a reasonable time whether we should continue to effect repairs to and keep in being our sabotage raiding apparatus. The dismemberment of these raiding teams could be accomplished without too much shock to the exile community. It would be noticed, but, if done carefully, particularly if it coincided with the commencement of “autonomous” operations, it should not cause undue repercussions and polemics against U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>As you know, again as part of the June plan, we are supporting two “autonomous” exile groups headed respectively by <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Manuel Artime</persName>
                            <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0646"/>and Manolo Ray. In both cases we have gone to maximum lengths to preserve the deniability of U.S. complicity in the operation. <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName>, who now possesses the greater mechanical and paramilitary apparatus, has required a good deal of hand-feeding although still within the context of deniability. He will probably not be ready for his operations against Cuba before April or May of this year. He possesses most of his hardware and maritime equipment and has negotiated geographical and political bases in Central America. Manolo Ray has been handled on a much more independent basis. We have furnished him money and a certain amount of general advice. He does not possess the physical accoutrements that <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> has and is probably not as well equipped in terms of professional planning. <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> has a better political image inside Cuba among supporters of the revolution and has recently acquired, according to reports, some of the other leftwing exile activist groups such as Gutierrez Menoyo and his Second Front of the Escambray. He is said to be ready to move into Cuba on a clandestine basis late this spring. His first weapon will be sabotage inside Cuba, apparently not externally-mounted hit-and-run raids.</p>
                        <p>If U.S. policy should demand that the “autonomous” operations be suspended, we could of course cut off our support immediately. <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> and his group might or might not disintegrate at once. Manolo Ray almost certainly would continue. Both groups are based outside the United States and our only real leverage on them is through our financial support but withdrawal of this support would probably be fatal to their operations in time. A cutoff of this support, even though this support has been untraceable in a technical sense, would have a considerable impact within the exile community. U.S. support is rumored, especially in the case of <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName>, and the collapse of the only remaining evidence of exile action against <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> would hit the exile community hard which is what it in turn would do to its favorite target, U.S. policy. The exile of today, however, appears to have lost much of his fervor and, in any case, does not seem to have the capacity for causing domestic trouble which he had a year or two ago. The Central American countries in which the exile bases exist would be greatly confused, although we have carefully never indicated to the governments of these countries any more than U.S. sympathy for the “autonomous” groups.</p>
                        <p>We have a capacity, which is increasing, to sabotage Cuban merchant ships calling at foreign ports. We are emphasizing in this program the more subtle forms of sabotage as against large explosions obviously stemming from agent-placed bombs and limpets. The Cuban merchant fleet, among the most badly run in the world, can be helped along to a measurable degree by this program.</p>
                        <p>On the economic warfare front, as you know, we have for many months conducted a covert denial program based on limited <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0647"/>capabilities directed at very narrow targets. The effectiveness of this program is dependent on the careful selection of items to be denied in terms of their critical value to a key element of the Cuban economy. Despite the virtual collapse of the U.S. overall economic denial program against Cuba, we still retain the capacity, using unofficial and covert methods, to hurt but obviously not to destroy certain bits of the Cuban economy. This effort can be complemented by carefully concealed contamination of lubricants and similar actions.</p>
                        <p>Our program to get in touch with and subvert members of the military establishment and other elite groups in Cuba continues. Its chance of success naturally rises and falls with the state of morale inside Cuba as influenced by the success or inactivity of our other programs and the U.S. posture in general.</p>
                        <p>Our intelligence program continues at full force. It will be affected by anti-<persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> morale but we believe that we can offset the effects of further deterioration in this morale by increasingly tightened and efficient operations.</p>
                        <p>We are seeking your advice to know which of the above lines of actions we should continue, which we should try to retain as a shelf capability and which to abandon. (Of course, intelligence collection would continue.) As parts of an integrated national program designed to have at least a fighting chance to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, they seemed to us to make sense; as separate pieces they can serve to exert some braking effect on <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs progress, but that is about all.</p>

                        <p>I refer to the Presidentʼs memo to the Secretary (attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">See the attachment to <ref target="#d248">Document 248</ref>. A notation in the upper left hand corner in <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>ʼs handwriting reads “GC. Ask them where this is?”</note> requesting that warnings be given to the Russians and Cubans to deter SAM firings at our U–2ʼs over Cuba.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">John Crimmins</persName> tells me that, a couple days ago, State completed a package for the Presidentʼs approval.<note n="3" xml:id="d250fn3">
                                <ref target="#d251">Document 251</ref>.</note> The Secretary signed off and intended to bring the matter up at the luncheon meeting with the President on Tuesday;<note n="4" xml:id="d250fn4">March 10; no other record of this meeting has been found.</note> reportedly, he did not do so because other people were present. The State paper recommends that we send a warning note to the Cubans only; we would send it through the Czech Embassy so that the Russians would be sure to see it. Tommy Thompson feels that we should not send a warning note directly to the Russians.</p>
                        <p>It is hard to comment without seeing the State package but my own preliminary view is that the general guiding principle in this case must be that we should do whatever is most likely to restrain the Cubans from shooting down a U–2. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> scares me because I think he is a man who can regard a threat as credible but still disregard the consequences if his honor and emotion are involved; the upcoming <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> action may be just the sort of thing which will rile him next. On the other hand, when the Russians regard a threat as credible, they appear likely to act accordingly. In short, I believe that we are most likely to prevent a shoot-down if our note to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> is buttressed by a good strong pitch from Khrushchev to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>; Khrushchev, after all, has real leverage over <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>.</p>
                        <p>If Tommy Thompsonʼs indirect approach to the Russians is most likely to result in a strong Khrushchev pitch to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, then I am for it. If, however, we are more likely to get the most effective Khrushchev pitch <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0649"/>by sending a stiff note directly to the Russians, then other arguments, against sending a note to the Russians, should be very powerful to be over-riding. (Another consideration might be that we would want our position on a shoot-down to be clearly on the record vis-à-vis the USSR; especially, if one occurs.)</p>

                            <item>I recommend that the warning to the Cubans and Soviets against interfering with our overflights of Cuba, which you requested in your memorandum of March 6, 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d251fn2">See the attachment to <ref target="#d248">Document 248</ref>.</note> be done in the form of a note to the Cuban Government to be delivered through the Czech Ambassador in Washington. By using this method and channel we can be sure that the Soviets will also get the message without our incurring the disadvantage of making a special, direct approach to them on the subject.

                        <p>The late President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> and I on various occasions following the missile crisis made public statements indicating that in the absence of inspection on the ground we would maintain our surveillance flights over Cuba and that any interference with those flights would invite a dangerous situation. A compilation of these statements is enclosed.<note n="5" xml:id="d251fn5">Attached but not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Last June the Cubans sent us a note protesting U.S. overflights<note n="6" xml:id="d251fn6">The text of this note is in the Microfiche Supplement to Volumes X, XI, and XII of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963.</note> and warning that: (1) Cuban gunners had orders to fire at any foreign war plane that makes low-altitude flights over Cuban territory, and (2) the Cuban Government was stepping up its preparations to shoot down any war plane that violated Cuban air space at any altitude. In our reply, sent to the Cubans through the Czechs, we reminded the Cuban Government of our publicly expressed position on the dangers of any interference with air surveillance and pointed out that our position remained unchanged. We considered sending the note through the Czechs tantamount to notifying the Soviets of our position. The text of our reply is enclosed.<note n="7" xml:id="d251fn7">Attached but not printed; see <ref target="frus1961-63v11#d352">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. XI, Document 352</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In recent months <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Fidel Castro</persName> has repeatedly alluded to violation of Cuban air space by U.S. aircraft. The most forthright of his statements was made in a press conference with foreign newsmen on February 6, 1964. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> said: “The Government of Cuba has repeatedly warned the United States of the consequences which may result from violations of our air space. It must not be forgotten that this is an arbitrary action which may create problems and incidents.”</p>
                        <p>The foregoing statement, made in the context of the fishing boat incident, gives us a good occasion for sending a warning to the Cubans on the overflights. Since in the next few days we plan to send a routine reply to the Cubans, via the Czech Ambassador, on their notes concerning various aspects of the fishing boat incident and Guantanamo, we would use the same occasion to deliver the warning note. By sending the note through the Czech Ambassador we can be sure that it will reach the Soviets. This will avoid our having to make a special, direct approach to the Soviets on this matter, which could be counterproductive in that the Soviets would feel compelled to respond and thus commit themselves more formally in ways they may otherwise desire to avoid.</p>

The fact that the Russians may be turning over “control” of the SAM sites to the Cubans does not relieve the Russians of their responsibility to ensure that these SAMs are not used against the U.S. reconnaissance planes.

                            <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName> has discussed with me your views on notification to the Soviets of our attitude toward a possible Cuban shoot-down of a U–2 after the Cubans assume control of the SAM sites.</p>
                        <p>I feel sure that even an informal approach will prompt a reply from the Soviets and that they would be bound to state that the Cubans have every right to defend their sovereignty over their air space. The important thing, in my view, is that if the Cubans do shoot down a U–2, we will want to treat our retaliatory action as a purely United States/Cuban affair. This would be harder to do if we were on prior notice from the Soviets that they would support the Cubans in their defense of their sovereignty, which is a quite possible Soviet response to any direct approach on our part. I feel confident that before turning over the SAMs to the Cubans, the Soviets will have had some understanding with them <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0653"/>about their use. If the Cubans should shoot down a plane without prior agreement with the Soviets, I think it quite possible that the Soviets, while making fierce noises, would not, in fact, give the Cubans real support and would use the violation of their understanding as an excuse for not doing so.</p>

                            <item>With regard to possible actions by the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the United States Government should seek the cooperation of the other <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> members in obtaining the complete isolation of Cuba from other American States. Further, the United States should, if possible, secure broad authority for a wide range of actions under Article 8 of the Rio Treaty, including the possible use of armed force against Cuba, should <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> members, individually or collectively, deem such action necessary to prevent further intervention and aggression by <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. With these possible objectives for <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> action in mind, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have studied the text of the proposed <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> resolution which the United States has suggested that the Venezuelan Government propose for the consideration of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> member states. They consider that if such a resolution is adopted essentially in its present form, the United States Government will have <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0654"/>sufficient basis for action directed at the further isolation of Cuba and for military action against <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> in case of further aggression on his part.

                        <p>Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George W. Ball</persName>ʼs speech on “United States Policy Toward Cuba” before the North Atlantic Council in Paris on March 23, 1964, was an important statement on U.S. policy toward Cuba during the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> Presidency. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 1 CUBA–<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the loss of Cuba to communism was a loss not just to the United States, with its long and particularly close ties to that country, but to all free nations, because it had created a beachhead of communism in a very vulnerable but important part of the world, Latin America. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that the United States regarded Cuba as a subversive threat, not a military one. He highlighted the aggressive and subversive nature of Castroism, the non-negotiability to the United States of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs political, economic, and military dependence on the Soviet Union and his subversive activities in Latin America, and the objectives of the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> economic denial programs. The latter, he said, were limited to lessening <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs will and ability to export subversion and violence, convincing the Cuban and Latin American peoples that Castroism could not serve their interests and that communism had no future in the Western Hemisphere, and increasing the cost to the Soviet Union of maintaining a Communist outpost in Latin America. Ultimately, however, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that Latin America would be rendered “immune to Communist infection only by an amelioration of the conditions—political, economic, and social—in which subversion flourishes. The United States and the free nations of Latin America have, therefore, through the Alliance for Progress, undertaken a major collective effort” to transform the structure and production of the region.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> explained how Cuba was “almost uniquely suited to a policy of economic denial,” but that the program would “be effective only if generally supported by the Western Alliance.” <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the United States and its allies had developed a three-pronged program of common action to exploit Cubaʼs economic vulnerability by: 1) restricting the availability of Free World shipping to Cuba, 2) limiting the categories of goods available to Cuba, and 3) limiting governmental credit guarantees in connection with sales to Cuba. The importance of the latter action was emphasized by <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. Noting that “a recent transaction was presumbly made possible only by a positive government decision to guarantee the financing,” he said:
<quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The primary question is not, therefore, whether governments should impose negative controls on exports to Cuba—as the United States does, for example. The central issue is whether member governments of the Western Alliance should take positive action to encourage <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0656"/>such sales by assuming risks that commercial bankers are unwilling to take.</p>
                                <p>“To the people of the Western Hemisphere—including many of my countrymen—this element gives such transactions the appearance of a political act—and an act that has the effect of defeating the principal instrument short of war available against a regime that seriously menaces free governments in the Western Hemisphere.”</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>In telegram Polto 1138 from Paris, March 23, Ambassador Finletter reported that <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>ʼs presentation “drew so much support that UK decided best not to speak at all. Canada, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Greece and Turkey spoke out strongly in favor <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy.” Finletter added that several “permanent representatives expressed view <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> case as just lucidly presented to NAC should be presented to European public badly informed on Cuba” and he concluded that “UK appears isolated in NAC on Cuba.” (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>In a meeting of the North Atlantic Council on April 15, reported in telegram Polto 1472 from Paris, April 15, British representative Shuckburgh read a statement under instructions in which he declared that the United Kingdom was “opposed in principle to economic warfare no matter what name is except in case like Berlin contingency planning.” He added that the “UK does not agree that its trade policies should be custom tailored and designed to differentiate among Communist countries in accordance with conditions and behaviour of individual countries and with specific objectives towards each. This is fundamental difference.” Shuckburgh noted that the “British are a trading people and trade is essence of their survival.” In the case of Cuba, he said, British trade policy coincided with its political judgment, in that the “UK does not think that policy of economic denial is right or wise politically or likely to be effective.” Among many other arguments, Shuckburgh stated that the UK questioned “whether there is direct relationship between Cubaʼs economic strength and her capacity for subversion.” (Ibid.)</p>

                        <p>On March 6 we sent the Secretary of State a memorandum asking for a strong plan to warn “the Cubans and their Soviet friends” against any interference with our high-level surveillance in Cuba. The Department has now come back with a plan which is intelligent as far as it goes. In essence it is that we should send a diplomatic warning to the Cubans by way of the Czechs,<note n="2" xml:id="d256fn2">The warning was issued on March 27 to Czech Ambassador Duda, who was given two diplomatic notes for Cuba, one of which concerned the overflights. Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WAR1">Robert W. Adams</persName> emphasized to Duda that “we want to make sure that there is no misunderstanding about our continuing position on this matter.” (Memorandum of conversation; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, <gloss target="#t_ARACCA1">ARA/CCA</gloss> Files: Lot 73 D 191, PS 8–5, Gitmo Protests and Fishing Boat Incident) A copy of the protest note is ibid., Central Files 1964–66, AV 15 Overflights Problem—Public Relations, 1964.</note> and follow this up by certain covert statements which will reach Cuban ears and show that we are entirely serious.</p>

                        <p>I do think that one further element is needed—and that is an appropriate public warning from you at some appropriate time—perhaps in answer to a question at an early press conference.

In our judgment, <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> and, to a somewhat lesser extent, <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Manuel Ray</persName>, now possess the hardware and maritime equipment as well as the geographical and political bases in Central America needed to launch independent infiltration and sabotage operations against Cuba. Both groups also appear to have reached a state of training and psychological readiness which could impel their leaders to launch operations against Cuba at almost any time and with little or no notice to the U.S. Government.<note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2">According to <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U.

In an April 7 memorandum to the Secretary of Defense, <persName corresp="#p_CJAJ1">Califano</persName> wrote that although no decision was made on the future of the sabotage program at the April 2 Special Group meeting, “<persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> indicated that he would call a meeting with higher authority this week [see <ref target="#d259">Document 259</ref>] with the hope that definite policy lines could be determined for future covert activity against <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>.” (Washington National Records Center, OSD Files: FRC 330 77 1 31, Cuba, Activity Against <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>)</note>

                            <item>The possibility of imminent unilateral operations on the part of the autonomous groups is brought to the attention of the Special Group at this time since it is related to the question of the future of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-controlled sabotage and harassment operations now under review by higher authority.<note n="3" xml:id="d257fn3">At this point the following was crossed out: “This relationship was described in Part V of the memorandum entitled ‘Review of Current Program of Covert Action Against Cuba,’ dated 24 January 1964, submitted by the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs to the Special Group.” The January 24 memorandum is in Department of State,<gloss target="#t_INRIL1">INR/IL</gloss> Historical Files, 5412 Special Group/303 Committee Records.</note> It should be noted that if a policy decision is made <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0659"/>to terminate sabotage and harassment operations for the autonomous groups as well as for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, it will be necessary to terminate support for the autonomous groups as <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> would not be in a position to insure that they would refrain from raids and sabotage even if so requested.<note n="4" xml:id="d257fn4">Since the Special Group did not address this issue at its April 2 meeting, <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> asked that they have another look at the memorandum during the next weekly meeting. (Memorandum from <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> Deputy Director for Coordination Joseph W. Scott to <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, April 6; ibid.)</note> In fact, it now appears likely that neither group will disintegrate at once upon notification of termination of U.S. subsidies. While withdrawal of U.S. financial aid and moral support would probably be fatal to their operations in time, they are likely to make strenuous efforts to find other sources of support. In so doing and in order to prove their viability to potential supporters, they would, in their desperation, probably feel compelled to launch one or more dramatic raids against Cuba.</item>

                                    <item>In general, however, Cuban officials are cocky about their economic situation at present, and optimistic over prospects for improvement. You have probably read Che Guevaraʼs gloating remarks at the UN Trade and Development Conference in Geneva. The Cubans are convinced they have, as they say, “broken the back” of our economic denial effort.</item>

The sugar agreement <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> negotiated with the Soviet Union on his January visit makes them feel that sugar earnings will continue to increase. This confidence seems to be reflected in the credit ratings the Cubans are getting.

                            <item>There was a brief discussion of item (5) during which various methods of economic sabotage were described. There was no disposition on the part of those present to interfere with this program.</item>

                            <item>With respect to sabotage raiding by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-controlled assets, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that two things presently militate against a resumption of the program: (a) the pending <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> matter with respect to the Venezuelan arms cache which may be strengthened by discovery of arms in Argentina as well as in Brazil, and (b) the prospective turnover of the SAM sites by the Russians to the Cubans in April or May. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that we would wish to maintain a clean hands posture while the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> case is pending and that if the Cubans are to misuse the SAMs we would wish the onus to be fully on their backs. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that in addition he does not believe that hit-and-run raids are in any event very productive; that they have a high noise level and, furthermore, that he suspects the Cuban exiles who actually conduct the raids of possibly wishing to leave fingerprints pointing to U.S. involvement in order to increase that involvement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said that in the past he had been an advocate of sabotage operations, but in view of the history of the program since June, he had come to the conclusion that it is unlikely that an effective sabotage program will be conducted. In explanation he pointed out that the policymakers, each time for good reasons, had turned sabotage operations on and off to such an extent that a program of the type envisioned in the June paper simply does not, in the nature of things, appear feasible.</item>

                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> called attention to the paper dated 8 June 1963<note n="3" xml:id="d259fn3">See <ref target="frus1961-63v11#d346">
                                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. XI, Document 346</ref>.</note> which is the basis of the Agencyʼs current program against Cuba. He quoted from the 8 June paper as follows:
<quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>Paragraph 2: “The ultimate objective of this policy would be to encourage dissident elements in the military and other power centers of the regime to bring about the eventual liquidation of the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>/communist entourage and the elimination of the Soviet presence from Cuba.”</p>
                                        <p>With respect to the interdependence of the various courses of action comprising the program, he quoted from paragraph 5 of the paper as follows: “Unless all the components of this program are executed in tandem, the individual courses of action are almost certain to be of marginal value, even in terms of achieving relatively limited policy objectives. This is clearly a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”</p>
                                        <p>With respect to the sabotage program, he quoted from paragraph 6.E. as follows: “It must be recognized that no single act of sabotage by itself can materially affect the economy or stimulate significant resistance. However, it is our opinion that a well-planned series of sabotage efforts, properly executed, would in time produce the effect we seek.”</p>
                                    </quote>
                                </p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> pointed out that five relatively low-key sabotage operations since June 1963 do not in effect constitute a test of the program and that the statements quoted from the 8 June paper remain valid. He said that there was a surge of anti-<persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> sentiment during the fall of 1963, corresponding with the period during which the sabotage raids were conducted, but that resistance sentiment has now fallen into apathy. He said that the five items for which approval is recommended in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>ʼs paper would not have the effect envisioned by the 8 June paper although they might have the effect of slowing down <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs consolidation of his regime.</p>

                            <item>The Secretary of State said that part of our problem has to do with the Soviet Union which is now going through a crisis period, particularly with respect to the Sino-Soviet split. He said that he felt sure that were Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> present at the meeting he would indicate the danger of forcing Khrushchev to take a militant defensive attitude with respect to Cuba. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that should the Cubans shoot down a U–2, raid peaceful shipping off the coast or should there be a strong <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> resolution, the question of the conduct of sabotage raids could be reconsidered. (I do not think that I am in error in quoting the Secretary as equating a U–2 shootdown with a good <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> resolution as a basis for resuming raiding operations.)</item>

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that his attitude towards <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-conducted raiding operations would depend upon getting a clear legal basis for action against Cuba out of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. He said that he doubted that all <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0664"/>seven courses of action combined would result in the overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. He said that he leans away from <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-conducted raids and towards autonomous operations. He said that at the present time, particularly in the light of the Brazilian events, favorable action by the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> on proposed paragraph two of the resolution looks like a fifty-fifty chance. In reply to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>ʼs query, I said that I believed that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-controlled raiding assets could be held together for another two months pending the resolution of the Secretaryʼs two points (<gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and Cuban use of SAMs).</item>

                            <item>I briefed the President on the present status of autonomous operations, including the fact that <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> is planning to launch his operational program on the 12th of April. There was some discussion of these plans but no one appeared disposed to try to stop <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName>. I said that Manolo Rayʼs plans were not as well known to us but that he had made it clear that he intended to move by May.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>The Secretary of Defense said that it was his opinion that the covert program has no present chance of success in terms of upsetting <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Fidel Castro</persName>. He suggested that it might be useful, for reasons which had not been brought out at this meeting, and pointed out that the principal decision to be made was a broader one—presumably what the overall U.S. attitude should be with respect to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Fidel Castro</persName>. He said that he felt that the present raiding assets should be held in being pending resolution of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>ʼs two points but that in the meanwhile the fundamental question should be debated. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> said that he agrees with the suggestion of continuing these assets in being but that he believes that the program, if permitted to go forward as planned, would at least have the advantage of hindering <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> in the consolidation of his power. He pointed out that the noise level of the raiding operations had not in fact been very high. He would advise resuming raiding operations following the resolution of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>ʼs points. General Taylor said that the Joint Chiefs favor the program in its entirety, that they believe the program has never been given a fair test and that we should move forward with it in the interests of making <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs life as hard as possible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> covert program is the only matter to be resolved today, that the matter of our negotiations with the British on the economic program and sugar support would be ready for discussion next week.</item>

                            <item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> recommended to the President that we keep the raiding assets in being for the next two months and that the question be discussed again following the resolution of <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> events and the Cuban use of the SAM sites.</item>

Specifically <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> said that he could envisage such issues as extreme economic distress caused by sharp drop in sugar prices or other external factors arising which might cause <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> great pain and, ultimately, his downfall. In summing up his position <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> stated that the actions favorably looked upon, that is, intelligence gathering, propaganda, economic denial and surreptitious acts against Cuban ships all would have some effect but definitely would not accomplish the stated objectives.</p>

                        <p>A meeting was held at 1015 on 9 April with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FD1">Desmond FitzGerald</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard Helms</persName> to discuss the problem of independent action by Cuban emigre groups headed by <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Manuel Artime</persName> and Manolo Ray. The following points were made:</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> stated that he did not believe any verbal dissuasion had any chance of success with <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> in his determination to mount an operation from Central America.</p>
                        <p>Those present agreed that it was possible to block the operation by an air-sea search and by the use of U.S. Navy destroyer but that this was a drastic step.</p>
                        <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0666"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> pointed out that this could write finis to use of Cuban emigre groups and would radiate considerable fallout elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> capsuled the problem by saying his worry was whether an <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> attack would give the U.S. a hypocritical image when out of the other side of its mouth the U.S. was plumping for votes at the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> to outlaw subversion and armed attack.</p>
                        <p>He further said that he wanted to be clear as to whether higher authority fully grasped the implications of the autonomous exile group activity as discussed at Tuesdayʼs meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">See <ref target="#d259">Document 259</ref>.</note>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> felt it would be extremely useful to regularly publicize Castroite guerrilla activity both in Argentina (thus far played only by the <hi rend="italic">Christian Science Monitor</hi>) and in Central America as a contrasting backdrop to possible <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> slurs against Cuban exile activity.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Anatoliy F. Dobrynin</persName>, Soviet Ambassador</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>After a discussion of the other subjects the Secretary raised the matter of Cuba. He said that the United States had hoped the Western Hemisphere could be protected against aggression from Cuba either by the original <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–USSR agreement of October 1962 for ground inspection, which the USSR had been unable to persuade <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> to <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0667"/>accept, or by the establishment of a nuclear free zone in Latin America which would offer sufficient protection if it could contain some provision for following up on indications of violation. Unfortunately, neither of these had worked out. The basic point he wished to make to the Ambassador was that the United States has no desire to inflame the situation further. The United States overflights are as discreet as possible, but it is essential for the United States to maintain them so that we can tell our people and those of the other Hemisphere nations that there is no danger from Cuba. The overflights are also related to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs activities in the Hemisphere. Gromyko had said that these activities were more talk than action; but the United States has indications of actual Cuban subversive action in, for example, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, and most recently in Guatemala. The Secretary emphasized that he was mentioning these matters out of a desire to avoid a major crisis with Cuba. He hoped that the Soviet Government will caution <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> not to inflame the situation into a major crisis. The United States is not attempting to stir up a crisis over Cuba and he hoped <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> is in the same mood. He also hoped that some progress could be made toward a nuclear free zone in Latin America. He had the impression that the USSR would favor such a zone but that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> opposed it.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador in reply said that he would be frank. How could one convince a small country that it should allow the airplanes of a big country to overfly it? What self-respecting country could accept a note stating that overflights would continue? How can the United States have any right to overfly Cuba? The <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> has excluded Cuba, so how can the United States retain any rights from the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> system and agreements? Cuba could not be a serious threat to the United States or the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> knew he could live at peace with the other nations of the Hemisphere if he so desired, but on the contrary he had declared war against his neighbors. Therefore we must keep watch to assure against aggression. Cuba had mounted a real threat in Venezuela, and Guatemala, and was also involved in Panama. The basic point was that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> was not trying to find a way to live at peace with his neighbors, but, the Secretary repeated, the United States is not looking for trouble over this issue.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the Secretary reminded him that the USSR had agreed to ground inspection of the missile sites in Cuba in October 1962. He added that the United States had been interested in a nuclear free zone in Latin America because such a zone would go far to meet the inspection problem. In response to a question the Secretary confirmed that the United States and other Western Hemisphere nations are still interested in the possibility of a nuclear free zone which would include all except the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0668"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> raised the question as to why Cuba had suddenly received so much attention during the last few days. There followed an exchange on this subject in which the Secretary emphasized the celebration in Cuba of the anniversary of the Bay of Pigs invasion while <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> implied that the United States had itself generated the recent attention to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then repeated that any self-respecting government would react against overflights of its territory and said the USSR could not support with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> such a position (i.e., to urge him to accept the overflights).</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded the conversation by reiterating that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> had an opportunity to live at peace with his neighbors but was not interested and that the United States wants no further crisis over “this wretched little man” and he trusted the USSR felt the same way.</p>

                        <p>4. I mentioned to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> that I had discussed with Eisenhower the possibility of a Cuban shooting down a U–2. That Eisenhower first responded by indicating that he thought, under such circumstances, the offending SAM sites should be “taken out.” However, after considering the problem and reviewing a map, he expressed the opinion that perhaps it would be best to take out all the SAM sites, although Eisenhower did not go so far as to firmly recommend this action. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> then asked my opinion. I stated I most certainly <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0669"/>would take out several SAM sites in the vicinity and possibly all of them. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> retorted he agreed and in fact, he favored taking them all out, indicating that the public opinion, UN discussion, etc. would be just as valid on one as on all and therefore we might as well dispose of the problem in its totality.</p>
                        <p>I then told President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> it was unnecessary to have a U–2 shot down, that we could operate the ECM equipment, but this had been steadfastly opposed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The President asked that I discuss this matter with <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> and General Taylor.</p>

We further estimated that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> might endeavor through diplomatic and propaganda means to force a political solution with regard to the overflights, beginning such a campaign even before final transfer of the system.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> is now engaged in a campaign of this sort; we believe that he still prefers to try to force the cessation of U–2 flights by political pressure at the UN and elsewhere.

                            <item>The Soviets must for obvious reasons give strong political support to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, yet they almost certainly wish to avoid the major crisis which would follow a shoot-down. They could escape such a crisis by withholding control of the SAM system, and we do not rule this out despite the high political cost to the USSR. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, however, can have no assurance that Khrushchev will take this way out. Indeed, we continue to estimate that the odds favor the complete turnover of controls to Cuban personnel. Moreover, the Soviets probably still hope to persuade the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to discontinue or modify the overflight program. Recent Soviet approaches to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> may have been designed to gain time and probe for a possible settlement. Probably also the Soviets will strongly urge <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> to try all possible political actions before shooting.</item>

It noted that the vulnerable U–2 aircraft could be made less so if electronic countermeasures (ECM) were used, but that the “continued use of ECM would, in the opinion of experts, permit the early development of counter countermeasures and hence the value of the ECM equipment would rapidly deteriorate.” Peripheral photographic reconnaissance “will not provide needed intelligence.” The <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> stated that drones “would produce useful photography though not as good as the U–2,” but that they were “vulnerable, more so than the U–2.” The new <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-developed high-altitude, high-speed Oxcart reconnaissance aircraft, later known as the SR–71 Blackbird, would “not be operational at the design speed of 3.2 Mach and 85,000 to 90,000 feet for another few months.” The CORONA satellite system was judged to be “not sufficient to give us useful photography.”</note>

                            <item>My final recommendation was that the U–2 flights should be continued, the use of ECMʼs should be carefully considered and in the final analysis the compromise of ECM equipment was up to the JCS and the Secretary of Defense. Alternate means of aerial photography were not satisfactory; alternate intelligence assets would not suffice our needs; we could expect a continuing flow of human resource information concerning “missiles in Cuba”, which must be checked out.</item>

                            <item>During the meeting there was considerable discussion of the use of the Oxcart. I stated that it was my opinion (though I had not checked it out with our operators) that it could be used in a matter of weeks at about 2.2 Mach, 75,000 feet and several months later at 3.2 Mach and 85,000 or 90,000 feet, that its presence would be known because it would appear on the radar and the sonic boom would be audible, it would be more disturbing to people in Cuba than U–2ʼs because they could not see the U–2 but they would hear the Oxcart, that because of the absence of the Tall King search radar I felt the SAMs with their Fan Song would not be effective on the U–2 because of their short reaction time. I pointed out the use of the Oxcart would compromise it as a reconnaissance vehicle. No decision was reached.</item>

He pointed and, and I confirmed, that this would create a new situation as it would demonstrate <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs true intentions which were now only a matter of conjecture. <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> asked that the Contingency Plan be amended to discuss courses of action under such a situation.</item>

                        <p>The meeting began without the President. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> distributed, and the group read, the attached <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 85–2–64, “Likelihood of an Attempted Shoot-down of a U–2.”<note n="2" xml:id="d266fn2">
                                <ref target="#d264">Document 264</ref>.</note> The conclusion was that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> prefers <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0676"/>to try to halt the U–2 flights by pressure at the UN and elsewhere, but, failing this, there is a significant, and, over time, a growing chance that he will try a shoot-down.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said we need to deal with four questions:
<list>

                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>Are there any additional political actions which we could take in the immediate future to reduce the risk that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> will try to shoot down a U–2?</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName>, reading from a paper,<note n="3" xml:id="d266fn3">See <ref target="#d265fn2">footnote 2, Document 265</ref>.</note> made the following points in response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>ʼs request for the views of the intelligence community:
<list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Aerial photography is the only dependable evidence we have on the status of Soviet military equipment in Cuba. All alternatives to aerial photography have been carefully studied and all have been found wanting.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>The intelligence community has concluded that overflights must be continued but the number of missions can be reduced from the number now flown. Three flights per week are considered essential. There have been forty-two refugee reports about missiles in Cuba since January 1, 1964. In order to check on these reports, we must have aerial photography.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> will probably take over control of the SAM sites and he probably will try to shoot down a U–2 at some time in the near future.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether we had aerial photography which we had not read out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> replied that we did not. However, we have taken pictures of the same objects many times but we continue to have a requirement for current pictures in order to check on incoming refugee reports.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said all agree that overflights are required. The number of flights could be reduced but this made little difference because the risk of a shoot-down remained approximately the same and the political cost of the overflight problem was not materially affected by the number of missions flown.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> expressed the agreement of all those present that there is a requirement for from two to three flights per week—two certainly and an additional one if cloud cover or other operational problems make the third flight necessary.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> commented that overflights of Cuba create a strain on Soviet-Cuban relations. The Soviets, in their May Day slogans, had downgraded the Cuban problem. The Soviets believed, <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0677"/>however, that because we had sent a note on overflights to the Cubans via the Czechs, we were taking a new initiative and launching a new move against <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. They felt we had concluded that we had interpreted the climate of improving U.S.-Soviet relations to mean that we had a free hand to do what we wished to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> as far as the USSR was concerned.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had asked him directly<note n="4" xml:id="d266fn4">See <ref target="#d261">Document 261</ref>.</note> why we had raised the problem of the overflights in a note in writing. He had left the impression that we could have handled this in another way, thereby avoiding making a direct issue of a problem which had not been causing concern for months.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> recalled that during the missile crisis of October 1962 we had discussed a nuclear free zone in Latin America and onsite inspection in Cuba by the UN. These ideas had been accepted by Khrushchev but flatly rejected by <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, in his recent speech, had made clear that the overflights issue was not of a nature to lead to the possibility of nuclear war. However, the Ambassador believes the danger of a Cuban shoot-down of a U–2 will increase.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that a shoot-down was not imminent. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> also agreed with this view which is expressed in the <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>. However, there is a strong possibility that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> will raise this question in the UN.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then asked how we could best meet the agreed intelligence requirement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> said that the U–2 was vulnerable. If we equipped it with electronic countermeasures (ECM), its vulnerability would be greatly decreased, but countermeasures would be developed very rapidly, thereby reducing the effectiveness of existing ECM equipment. In addition, the use of ECM risks compromising the equipment in the event that an ECM-equipped U–2 were shot down. The Russians know about our system but they are not familiar with specific equipment which we have developed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out that if the Russians knew our ECM was on a U–2, they might try very hard to shoot one down.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fubini, as the expert, answered a question as to whether the Powers plane had been equipped with ECM. He said the plane did have some ECM equipment which undoubtedly had been obtained by the Russians. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> added that all the Governmentʼs ECM experts are agreed that the Soviets have our ECM equipment or equipment similar to it. General LeMay noted that he believed the Soviets may have the idea of our system but they do not have specific knowledge of our equipment.</p>
                        <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0678"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that ECM is not on our major strike forces. If an ECM-equipped U–2 is shot at, the plane would be ordered to abort its mission and its chances of survival would be almost 100%. If the plane were shot at, we would then have a new confrontation requiring additional U.S. action. This particular situation is not included in the present contingency plan which is based on a U–2 having been shot down.</p>
                        <p>General LeMay said that the Cubans had the option of not shooting at the first mission of an ECM-equipped U–2. In a short time they would learn how to deal with the ECM equipment and then would be in a position to attack the U–2.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said that even after practice the Cubans would have only an approximate 20% chance of shooting down an ECM-equipped U–2. Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> commented that the chances of hitting a U–2 were much greater if it did not have ECM equipment.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> commented on the following alternative methods of fulfilling our intelligence requirements:
<list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Peripheral photography</hi>. This is useful for targets on the coast but it does not cover inland targets and will not provide the intelligence we require.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Drones</hi>. They do not produce as good coverage as the U–2. They are more vulnerable. The shooting down of a drone would call for a different response by the U.S. because no pilot is involved.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Balloons</hi>. These could operate at 90–100 thousand feet with good cameras and would be relatively invulnerable. However, they cannot be controlled without an elaborate setup which does not exist but which could be constructed. The coverage depends on the control of the balloons. Thus, the coverage is not as good as the U–2 and the American public, learning of this, could complain that we were not adequately covering the island. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that a balloon is different only because it is unmanned.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>General LeMay, responding to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>ʼs question, said the pilot of a U–2 cannot outmaneuver a SAM missile. To do so keeps the plane in the area a longer time, and, therefore, increases the risk. SAM missile guidance makes them lethal.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>
                                <hi rend="italic">Oxcart</hi>. This plane is not ready to fly at its peak capacity and will not be for several months. It is now able to fly mach 2.2 at 75 thousand feet. It could not be shot down but its presence would be detected. The propaganda difficulty would not be relieved because the plane makes a loud sonic boom which would be heard by many people on the ground. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> commented that we might use the Oxcart with its sonic boom and then ask <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> if he preferred that we go back to the silent U–2. This might be something to talk about.</item>
                            <label>(5)</label>
                            <item>
                                <hi rend="italic">Satellites</hi>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> said the camera resolution is not good enough for our purposes. The weather is often difficult and cloud cover is a problem. As to specific targets, it is not possible to synchronize <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0679"/>the satellite so that specific targets would be covered by plan not by coincidence. There is the difficulty of the north and south orbit of present satellites. Only 5% of the island would be covered in a four-day orbit. There is a possibility of an east-west satellite orbit, but it would take at least nine months to establish tracking stations to make such an orbit possible. The expanse of an east-west orbit system would be considerable. In summary, there is no satisfactory alternative to the U–2.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In answer to a question, General LeMay said the B-58 could not do the job even with ECM. The plane is capable of a supersonic burst and the first mission would get through, but following missions would have great difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> discussed political actions which might be taken:

                                    <p>We might revise the October 1962 proposals for onsite inspection in Cuba. The risk here is that the Cubans might accept and then we would have to give up overflights in return. Would a UN on-site inspection system meet our intelligence requirements? In October 1962 we answered this question in the negative.</p>
                                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> said he was not prepared to answer the question but he would look at it carefully. He personally doubted the value of a UN on-site inspection in Cuba.</p>

                                <item>World Court. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> is not too sanguine about what we would do if <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> took us to the World Court in an effort to disprove our right to overfly Cuba. We could show that our authority for the overflights was given us by the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> but is an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> ruling binding on Cuba which refused to accept the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> decision? We say it is, but the International Court of Justice might not say it is. One way to deal with an effort by <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> to use the World Court would be for us to offer to adjudicate all outstanding legal issues with Cuba. We could thus confuse the overflight issue by talking about the legality of the nationalization of American property in Cuba, etc. There is always the possibility that Cuba could formally withdraw from the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and denounce the treaty, thereby claiming that it was not bound by any <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> action. One action we could take would be to go again to the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> to request a reaffirmation of the 1962 resolution.</item>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> concluded by saying that inevitably we must continue the U–2 flights. We should look again, perhaps at a later date, at the possibility of using Oxcart.</p>
                        <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0680"/>
                        <p>The President entered the meeting at 10:45. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> summarized the earlier discussion and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> summarized the conclusions, pro and con, of the use of ECM.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said that everyone agrees that overflights are necessary.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said the Joint Chiefs of Staff oppose the use of ECM on U–2s overflying Cuba because of the risk of reducing the effective implementation of our Single Integrated Operations Plan (SIOP). He said that he personally felt we could use the ECM and would have a 95% survival chance of escaping on the first shot if the U–2 immediately aborted. He did not recommend the use of ECM now because he did not think the Cubans were ready to attempt a shoot-down. He recommended that the use of ECM be reconsidered on the basis of a review each week of the risk of a Cuban effort to shoot down a U–2.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question, both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> and General LeMay said that the ECM equipment could be put on the U–2 a very few hours after a decision to do so is made.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> raised again the feasibility of using the A–11. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> described the sonic boom problem with the A–11 which the U–2 does not have. When the A–11 is flying at maximum altitude and maximum speed, it is dubious whether the SAM missile could hit it. It might not even be seen by Cuban radar.</p>
                        <p>The President said we had no choice but to continue our overflights. However, we should take every precaution to avoid a U–2 being shot down. He asked that we explore again the use of ECM. He asked that the Joint Chiefs of Staff review their position and to weigh the use of the ECM against the possibility of a U–2 shoot-down and what would flow from that action. We will meet again Tuesday to discuss the matter further. A careful study of the use of the A–11 as an alternative would be available then. We must provide the required intelligence, but we must make every effort to increase the security of the overflight planes. We should get our information in a most secure way and make the overflights as secure as possible. In the meantime, we should continue our present program.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said we might consider a mix of overflight instruments such as U–2s, interspersed with the A–11.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>, referring to the contingency plan in the event a U–2 is shot down, commented that the plan did not discuss what we would do if an ECM-equipped U–2 were shot at but not shot down.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said the contingency plan was available for the Presidentʼs reading. It provided for military reaction under certain circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed an interest in the contingency plan, particularly in view of the fact that he had read in the press all about what <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0681"/>it was supposed to contain. He expressed his irritation that war plans leak to the press. He had gotten almost to a point where he hated to meet with Foreign Ministers because he read in the press the following day everything he had said to the Minister and some things he hadnʼt said. Only four people were present at a recent meeting, but reports of what went on appeared in the press. (This apparently referred to a conversation with Foreign Minister Butler.) We must tighten up security and put an end to such press leaks.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> reviewed the use of ECM equipment on the U–2ʼs, stating that doing so would not compromise SIOP;<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">Single Integrated Operations Plan; see <ref target="frus1964-68v10#d112">

                            <item>General Taylor stated that the JCS agree that the use would not compromise SIOP; pointed out 14 countries have SAMs and therefore <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0682"/>compromise might be serious at some future time. Vulnerability was uncertain and was dependent upon the warhead, noting there were 100# and 500# warheads and that DIA had indicated 500# warheads were on the Cuban SAMs. (<persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> said we had no intelligence on this.)

                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> raised the question of whether a new pattern of flights crossing the island, rather than flying the axis of the island, would reduce exposure. <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said this could be done by increasing the number of flights and therefore the danger.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> then advanced the idea of drones, stating they were awkward to use, of questionable reliability, limited in quantity, but raised an alternative intelligence means. ECM would make them less vulnerable but would compromise ECM.</item>

                            <item>I then stated that drones were limited in number, were only six of two types operational and three in the works; altitudes were 54,000ʼ to 59,000ʼ versus 64,000ʼ to 72,000ʼ for the U–2ʼs; photography resolution equivalent to U–2 but area limited to 18-mile swath and 255 miles of linear coverage; that drones were vulnerable to MIG–21ʼs; that they could be identified by contrails and therefore I had reservations concerning their effectiveness. <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed and after some discussion the drone question was pretty well dismissed. The same is true of balloons as it was felt they represented more serious operational problems than drones. The Attorney General, Robert Kennedy, expressed himself very positively against changing to drones as it would represent an unacceptable retreat.</item>

                            <item>We then turned to a discussion of the Oxcart. I stated that it was coming along well, giving the figures on the number of flights and the speeds but that all of our operational people, without exception, felt that we must not attempt to use it until it is completely debugged and this would take several months. Furthermore I said that at 2.2 Mach the Oxcart would possibly be vulnerable to SAMs though this was uncertain.</item>

                            <item>Secretary Dillon then asked what the ultimate value of the Oxcart was. I stated that when fully operational it probably would be quite invulnerable except under miraculous circumstances.</item>

                        <p>The meeting began without the President. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> to review the problem of the use of electronic countermeasures (ECM) on U–2s overflying Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the use of ECM in the U–2 would not, in his opinion, seriously compromise implementation of SIOP. <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0684"/>Some experts believe the survivability of U.S. bombers over the USSR will be reduced if ECM is used over Cuba. This is very hard to evaluate. However, the use of ECM on U–2s over Cuba will not provide great protection for the planes flying regularly over Cuba. The protection will be limited to the first plane flying over. It would not be sufficient to protect U–2s on a regular flight basis. After the first flight there would be a 90% chance of a successful shootdown if the Cubans made a determined attack on the plane.</p>
                        <p>General Taylor said that the use of ECM would not have a serious effect on the implementation of SIOP. However, some fourteen countries now have Soviet SAM systems. To use ECM in Cuba would undoubtedly result in the transmittal to these other countries of the methods of dealing with the ECM. In addition, there may come a time when we have a critical need to look at a SAM-defended site. If we use the ECM now, we would throw away the one free ride which we would like to have in reserve in case of critical need. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommends against the use of ECM because it will not protect continued overflights, plus the fact that its use will risk compromising the ECM equipment.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said that flight plans could be made which expose a U–2 to attack from fewer SAM sites. He did not recommend that this course of action be followed.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the use of drones. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said the use of drones would be an awkward way of meeting our intelligence requirements. We had never operated drones to this extent. There are numerous operational problems limiting the capability of drones. We have enough drones now so that within ninety days we could carry out our full reconnaissance requirements, but for the next ninety days we could obtain only 75% of our requirements. These estimates excluded enemy action against the drones. With existing drones encountering enemy action we could probably carry on for several weeks, operating at the 59,000 to 54,000 foot level.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> said he had trouble with the suggestion that we rely on drones to meet our aerial reconnaissance requirements. Only two drones are operational now at 50,000 feet. Two more will be operational in the next fifteen days at this height. The U–2 operates at 64,000 to 68,000 feet. This difference in altitude is important because the drones flying at the lower level will have contrails. Thus, they are more detectable and more vulnerable. In addition, there is considerable difference in the width of ground photographed—18 vs. 30 nautical miles. The drones have a 255 linear mile limit, which is considerably less than the U–2s. There is a loss of track accuracy of plus or minus five miles, or approximately an eighteen-mile swath.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said he agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName>ʼs evaluation of the difference between the U–2s and drones, but, even so, we <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0685"/>could carry out our required intelligence mission by using drones. The cost would be about $80,000 per drone mission or about $150,000 per U–2 equivalent. It is true that the drones will cost more and are less predictable. If there is enemy action against the drones, they would be able to carry out their mission for a period varying from two to six weeks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> asked whether Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> was thinking of a course which would run <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> out of weapons. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said he was. For example, we might use nonphotographic drones which would be less costly to lose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> said the idea of running <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> out of SAM missiles would depend on whether he used MIG–21s against the drones. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that great pilot skill is required if a MIG actually shoots down a drone.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the possibility of our using drones was leaking to the press. This disturbed him greatly and he had instructed his press officers to deny flatly that any consideration is being given to the substitution of drones for U–2s.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> made the point that if it became known to the Cubans that we were flying drones, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> would undoubtedly attack them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said that he agreed that the Cubans would act much more promptly against a drone than against piloted planes. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> commented that we would have to respond to the shooting down of drones at some point, particularly if it later became possible for us to fly thirty drones per month.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> said the intelligence communityʼs best estimate was that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> had in Cuba 500 missiles for his SAMs. General Taylor said that the Cubans would not really know whether we were flying drones or piloted U–2s. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out, however, that if the Cubans knocked out drone after drone, we would have to make some response.</p>
                        <p>With respect to balloons, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said these had many of the disadvantages of drones, but operational difficulties with them were much higher.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether, if we made the maximum use of peripheral photography, our overflights requirement would be reduced. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> said not significantly.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether, if the Cubans took their case to the United Nations and said they were prepared to accept UN on-site inspection as soon as we gave up our overflights, would we find this acceptable? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> replied that on-site inspection can now be made much more dependable than was the case in October 1962 because we now have many aerial photographs of the island. The information we have received from these photographs will not decay seriously over time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName> recalled that the 1962 inspection plan had called for overflights by UN planes in addition to on-site inspection. We could renew <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0686"/>this proposal and insist on the UN-operated reconnaissance system. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> said he believed this put us in a very strong position. He thought that we could sell our European allies on such a proposal. He said that it was important, however, to make clear the difference between the kind of intelligence we wanted about specific targets for use in the event of an invasion and the kind of information which we need to reassure that strategic missiles were not being introduced into Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked if we could use a combination of means of aerial reconnaissance. He agreed that if the Cubans heard that we were replacing U–2s with drones they would certainly try to shoot down the drones.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> repeated his view that if word gets around that we are using drones, the Cubans would say that we are weakening our position. The Attorney General agreed that if the word got around that we were no longer flying U–2s, but using drones, the effect on public opinion would indeed be serious. He expressed his view forcefully.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked what was the status of the proposal to use the A–11 plane. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> replied that the A–11 was not ready for use. It has been operated successfully but not yet at the maximum speed it is apparently able to reach. It is coming along very well, indeed, but it would be most dangerous to use the A–11 now. The A–11 is vulnerable to flameout and to other operational difficulties. Several additional months are needed for testing to ensure that the plane is fully operational. For example, he said the early versions of the A–11 had to come down to 35,000 feet in order to relight their engines after a flameout. A way around this limitation had been found, but each plane had to be modified to include the new equipment making possible the relighting of the engines without the descent. He said we are on the very far frontier of knowledge and there are many problems remaining. Those who had operated the planes were unanimous in agreeing that it would be reckless to use them over Cuba without further testing. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said everyone was unanimous in opposing the use of the A–11 for at least several months. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that if the Cubans learned an A–11 was flying over they would make every effort to shoot it down.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the vulnerability of the A–11, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> said the plane would be much less vulnerable when it was fully ready. There were many imponderables in trying to decide whether the plane could be shot down. He concluded that it was theoretically possible to shoot down an A–11 if everything used against it worked perfectly, i.e., a perfectly trained crew and a perfect SAM site operation. He reminded the group that although the A–11 cannot be seen, its sonic boom can be heard clearly. Therefore, from <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs point of view, the use of the A–11 would be more objectionable than the U–2.</p>
                        <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0687"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> commented that it was doubtful that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> would contemplate early action against an overflying plane. He said the Soviets were very conscious of the timing in relation to the elections in the U.S. The Russians would object to the Cubans taking the case to the UN because our insistence on overflights would reveal that we think the Russians are capable of sending strategic missiles back to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName> pointed out that while <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> might not push his case in the UN, the Secretary General undoubtedly would ask for our informal views on <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs letter to the Secretary General. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that if this happened we could remind the Secretary General of our 1962 offer and say that we were prepared to negotiate on the basis of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> accepting on-site inspection and UN aerial reconnaissance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName> replied that we had some time in which to work this out. He felt we had several months.</p>
                        <p>The President joined the group and Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> summarized the earlier discussion.</p>
                        <p>As to compromising the ECM, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> said he doubted its use would result in making more difficult the implementation of the SIOP. He said that ECM did not ensure survival of the U–2, but that the first plane flown with ECM had a very high chance of escaping. This percentage dropped sharply after the first flight. He asked General Taylor to summarize the Joint Chiefs of Staff views on ECM. General Taylor repeated his earlier comments.</p>
                        <p>With respect to drones, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> estimated that even with enemy action, we would be able to carry on a continuous program of drone flights for one to twelve weeks, but if <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> fired on the drones, we would obviously have a major political problem.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the A–11, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> summarized his view that the plane was not now ready for use.</p>
                        <p>The President said, “This gets you back to where you were.” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> replied, “Yes.” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that was true, with one addition. We could engage in a political holding action with the UN Secretary General. There are ways to keep the ball in play, but we expect nothing to come of these moves.</p>
                        <p>The President asked how serious <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> was when he made statements about preventing overflights. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that over time he undoubtedly was serious. However, there are things we can do to reduce the risk of a shoot-down but we cannot back away in the face of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs threats.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if one of our planes is shot down, do we take out the SAM sites? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> replied that the contingency called for taking out one or more SAM sites.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> recommended that we proceed on the assumption that for the next week there will be no attack on our U–2s. <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0688"/>We should continue the flights of the U–2s. The Defense Department will look again at the proposals to use an ECM-equipped U–2 and to use drones. The production of drones will be immediately increased, but a flat denial will be made to any press queries about whether consideration is being given to the use of drones.</p>
                        <p>The question was asked whether the readiness of the Oxcart could be speeded up. Secretary Dillon asked what could be done in an allout effort to increase the readiness of the Oxcart. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> replied that the operators were working as fast as they could on dealing with each problem as it arises. He said he would keep the pressure on but he did not think that a crash program should be undertaken. He cited again the case of modifying the planes in order to make it possible for the pilot to relight the engine at maximum altitude in the event of a flameout.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether we should read anything into the timing of the public release by <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> of the discovery of the arms cache off the Cuban coast. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said we knew of their discovery of this cache on April 20th and they had waited several days before making their discovery public.</p>

                                        <p>This step is a drastic one and could lead to angry charges (in the U.S. and elsewhere) that we are lending positive support to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. It is probably a step we would not want to take unless it became clear that these exile raids, which we canʼt control, were propelling us to the brink.</p>

                                    <item>We can cut off all our ties with these exile groups (e.g. money, equipment, intelligence information).

                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> read the paper and commented with regard to “II Current Status” at the top of page 5 that he was not sure it was accurate to say he had “argued and suggested.” He said he had simply “raised the question.”<note n="3" xml:id="d270fn3">In a June 16 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Chase</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName>ʼs reappraisal “was apparently instigated by <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Tom Mann</persName>ʼs expressed feeling that if we mean what we say under the warning paragraph of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> resolution (subversion is aggression), we should keep our hands clean and cease support of autonomous exile operations.” (Ibid.)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> remarked it was a draft paper that would not be used “outside this room.” <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said it was not an important point.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> liked the paper. <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> said it was one-sided, but that “the more we worked on it the more one-sided it became.” <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> thought if we cut off aid the Cubans could blackmail us and it could get out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> then said that before proceeding with this discussion he would like to fill <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> in on the apprehension of Manolo Ray by the British in the Bahamas. He said <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> and party were picked up on Anguila Key Monday afternoon.<note n="4" xml:id="d270fn4">June 1.</note> They were discovered by the British on a normal patrol. <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> tried to get away, but the British pursued and picked him up. A U.S. Coast Guard plane assisted, said <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName>, “as is usual in such cases.” <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> explained that <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> was not using his own name, but that his identity was evidently now known. He said there were three Americans in the party, including a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> photographer and a girl radio operator.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> thought that being picked up ten days after he was supposed to be in Cuba would make a laughingstock of <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName>. He saw it as a “sticky” public relations problem for us also.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> explained that we collaborate with the British in matters of this nature “for many reasons”, particularly since August 1963 when <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs forces kidnapped a group of Cuban exiles from Anguila Key.</p>
                        <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0692"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> said in the present case the British want to take the position they cooperated with us, but that the fact is we were cooperating with them in their waters at their request.</p>
                        <p>He said there was a precedent for the present case in that another group of Cuban exiles was picked up on Anguila Key by the British a few months ago, tried, fined $210 each, given suspended sentences of 90 days and deported to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> said when we capture such groups we simply seize their equipment and set them free.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> thought we might quietly suggest to the British they do about what we do in cases like this. He thought we might tell them they were heading into a hornetʼs nest, that they had a hero.</p>
                        <p>It was explained that the group was due in Nassau at 1:30 June 3 (the day of the meeting) and that they would undoubtedly be tried, as were the others. It was decided that “without really twisting their arm” the British would be asked to low key the matter as much as possible. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> suggested <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> talk with <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName> about how to handle this aspect of the matter.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> said a related development was that weapons “from a West Coast carriage factory” made for <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> had been traced by U.S. officials to a basement in Miami which is now under surveillance. Included in these, said <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName>, is a special “assassination” weapon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> also reported that <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> will put to sea Friday (June 5) for two operations in Oriente province, one east and the other west of Santiago. <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> seemed to think these operations would be more “cream puff” in nature than the Pilon raid. It was his understanding that they would not involve landings.</p>
                        <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>ʼs next appointment was announced and there was no time to return to a discussion of the autonomous operations paper. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he would study the memorandum and probably arrange a special meeting to discuss it.</p>

                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion of Brazil, Mexico, and other Latin American countries.]</p>
                        <p>President: What are our danger spots?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, thatʼs the—</p>
                        <p>President: Chile election?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Thatʼs the biggest one, I would say, with the fact of the Communist element in it.</p>
                        <p>President: And the Dominican—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: The overflights over Cuba.</p>
                        <p>President: What in the world can we do to minimize that? We canʼt go around them. We canʼt circle the island. We got to go over it. And—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: I think weʼll get, Iʼm hoping weʼll get some good resolutions, which would be very helpful on the domestic front, and also of real value to us.</p>
                        <p>President: Is trade going up much between the British and the Cubans?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, it has in terms of British exports to Cuba, and French exports.</p>
                        <p>President: They told me when they were here that theyʼd been 55 million, theyʼd cut them to five, but theyʼd be up on account of the buses. Now what, how much are they up to?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, what really happened, I donʼt have the figures in my head, but I know itʼs up quite a bit, Mr. President, because theyʼve been buying all this sugar, and theyʼve got these, Cubaʼs got the convertible currencies to buy anything they want. I think itʼs about two hundred million dollars a year that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> made last year, and we expect him to make about the same this year as a result of the increased price of sugar. Now sugar prices are dropping, this is a very temporary phenomenon, sugar prices are dropping and heʼs just, heʼs not going to have the money to buy this kind of stuff much longer. So I donʼt think <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0694"/>that the prognosis, the medium and long term prognosis, is bad. Itʼs good.</p>
                        <p>President: You getting any reports of the things inside Cuba? Whatʼs happening?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, not really anything new that—</p>
                        <p>President: Is there any dissatisfaction?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Yes, we figure about 25 percent of the people—the job holders, the office holders, especially the young people in the country who are better off than they ever were before—are totally in favor of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. We think he can count on about 25 to 30 percent of the people. We think there are about 25 to 30 percent of the people who are opposed to him, and the middle ground there, the 40 to 50 percent, are just sort of apathetic. And thatʼs the way itʼs been for the last year or so, and there isnʼt much change in that, because his hard core of support is built around the people who hold jobs.</p>
                        <p>President: Would you say that our economic isolation policy has been a complete failure?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: No, sir. I think itʼs been largely successful. I—</p>
                        <p>President: How? When the French and British are all trading with him?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, heʼs had these dollars and theyʼve sold him some things, and thatʼs hurt us. But on the, if—The alternative would be to let the bars down and let them extend credits and that sort of thing. And weʼve been very successful in keeping this limited to a number of isolated transactions. And this is a hell of lot better than taking him into our bosom.</p>
                        <p>President: How are we going to get rid of him?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Itʼs going to take some time.</p>
                        <p>President: Well—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: I think itʼs going to have to come from—I really donʼt think that, unless somebody kills <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, or he dies, or the army is split in the very top command where they turn on him, the army especially, that the people themselves can get rid of him. As long as that army is loyal to him, heʼs going to be there until he dies. And when he dies, nobody knows whatʼs going to happen, because heʼs got the same power to mesmerize people that Hitler had, and we doubt that anybody else has got, can project this same kind of image. The only other way to knock him off would be to go in there with force from the outside, and this could happen, either as a result of our reactions to his shooting at our planes that are doing this photographic stuff, or as a result of collective action which weʼre working on in this Venezuelan thing, whereby he tries again what he did in Venezuela, and if at that time you decide you want authority, the legal basis to go in, and you <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0695"/>want to go in, I think we could get it. The main objective we hope to get out of this meeting is to say that subversion, communist subversion, is an aggression which is not an armed attack within the meaning of article six of the Rio Treaty, get them to accept that, so that if we have another act of subversion, weʼll have a good legal basis of going to the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and saying now you agreed that this was the law, and here are the facts, and this is what we ought to do. Because the biggest problem, as you know, that we had in the Bay of Pigs, was this doubt on the part of the lawyers and others that we had any right in international law to do anything, and we hope to clear that up considerably.</p>
                        <p>President: So that for the subversion by importing arms to other countries to be considered aggression, that would justify our moving.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Thatʼs what we—If he does it again. But we would have to go to the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and prove the facts. They didnʼt want to give us a blank check.</p>
                        <p>President: Well, youʼve got a statement there,<note n="2" xml:id="d271fn2">The President was evidently referring to a June 2 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> to him that advocated that a “no invasion” statement be made at a press conference. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> suggested that the Soviets “might find it easier to keep <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> under control if you were to reaffirm our intent not to launch an invasion of Cuba unless the Cubans forced it on us.” <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> included the text of a proposed statement. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Memos to the President, <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, Vol. 5, 1964–1965)</note> say I ought to say at a press conference that I donʼt intend to invade Cuba, just as <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> didnʼt.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, sir, if I were you, I wouldnʼt make a statement like that, because who can tell whatʼs going to happen tomorrow? Suppose he shoots tomorrow and—</p>
                        <p>President: Well they say Khrushchev is saying that he hadnʼt seen us repeat <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName>ʼs pledge and we ought to do it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>: Well, I would send, I wouldnʼt make a public statement, Iʼd have the Secretary of State say that if he behaves himself, doesnʼt commit any aggressive acts against other Republics, and doesnʼt shoot at any of our planes, or doesnʼt give us cause to do anything, that everythingʼs going to be all right in terms of war and peace.</p>
                        <p>President: You tell, in the morning you call <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Mac Bundy</persName>, heʼs not here, but you call him, and tell him I was talking to you last night, and youʼd like to know what heʼd propose to say in that statement and then you tell him why you donʼt think it ought to be done.<note n="3" xml:id="d271fn3">See <ref target="#d272">Document 272</ref>.</note>

                        <p>I understand from <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Tom Mann</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2">See <ref target="#d271">Document 271</ref>.</note> that the President is considering the desirability of volunteering a press statement reiterating our position with respect to a military invasion of Cuba. Tom and I have thoroughly considered the matter, and for the reasons set forth below do not recommend that such a statement be made. However, if nevertheless the President desires to make a statement, we would recommend the following text, which has been carefully drawn from and conforms to the statements President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> made in late 1962 and 1963:<note n="3" xml:id="d272fn3">See <ref target="frus1961-63v11#d95">

XI, Document 95</ref>, for the “assurances against the invasion of Cuba” that <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> gave Khrushchev in telegram 1015 to Moscow, October 27, 1962. The White House simultaneously released the text to the press. At his news conference on November 20, 1962, President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> stated that “for our part, if all offensive weapons systems are removed from Cuba and kept out of the hemisphere in the future, under adequate verification and safeguards, and if Cuba is not used for the export of aggressive Communist purposes, there will be peace in the Caribbean. And as I said in September, ‘we shall neither initiate nor permit aggression in this hemisphere.’” Asked to “be a bit more specific on the scope of your no-invasion pledge” to Khrushchev, <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> replied that “I think if you re-read the statement you will see the position of the Government on that matter.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States, John F. Kennedy, 1962</hi>, pp. 831 and 832)</note>

                                <p>“As President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> pointed out on several occasions, we do not intend to launch a military invasion of Cuba or to begin a war against Cuba. Should, however, Cuba again become a military threat to us or its neighbors, or should it carry out aggressive acts against us or other countries of the Hemisphere, then we would have an entirely different situation. Thus, peace in the Caribbean depends on the actions of the Cuban Government. This was the position of the <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> Administration; it is the position of this Administration.”</p>

                        <p>While the foregoing covers the two situations that might lead to armed conflict, introduction of offensive missiles, or an act of aggression against any American republic, the statement is of necessity ambiguous as to whether the phrase “aggressive acts” includes acts of the <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0697"/>kind that recently took place in Venezuela. We will be on much sounder ground with respect to acts of this kind after we obtain agreement on the Venezuela resolution in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>However, the basic difficulty we see is that now to take the initiative in raising the issue of the “no invasion pledge,” at a time when it is not being pressed either by the Soviets<note n="4" xml:id="d272fn4">In a June 16 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> wrote: “There are rumors already current in Latin America and in the United States that the United States and Russia have reached some kind of accommodation on Cuba.” While <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that he thought this was “not an accurate description of our policy,” he argued that a “no invasion” pledge would “give currency” to the “notion of coexistence.” <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> also stated that a “no invasion” pledge “might cloud our legal right to retaliate against <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>” for shooting down a U–2 plane since Russia had already advanced the legal argument “that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> would not be guilty of an ‘aggressive act’ as he was only defending Cuban air space.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_LA1">LA</gloss> Files: Lot 66 D 65, Cuba File)</note> or domestically, inevitably raises problems on one or both sides. To the degree that any statement appears to Khrushchev to be less than the <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> statements it requires a response on his part, and to the degree that any statement appears to be more than the domestic understanding of President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName>ʼs statements it raises domestic questions of the degree to which the Administration is prepared to “co-exist” with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d272fn5">The President did not make a “no invasion” pledge.</note>

He added the options of searching harder for an alternative to the U–2 and encouraging the exile groups to make internally-mounted rather than the externally-mounted raids that he had proposed in his May 14 memorandum. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Cuba, Exile Activities, Vol. II, 1964–1965)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Pending this basic decision, we have an immediate problem with respect to <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Manuel Ray</persName> and his organization, JURE. <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> wants three things from us: (a) an immediate special grant of funds (over and above the funds he received at the beginning of this month) to recoup his losses from the recent fiasco; (b) intercession with law enforcement agencies in Puerto Rico to relax the very strict surveillance they maintain over his principal vessel so that it can leave Puerto Rico for Costa Rica; and (c) intercession with the Dominican Government to give him a base and, possibly, broadcasting facilities in the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>The question is: Should we meet any of these requests in view of <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName>ʼs recent performance?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> has been guilty of violations of the rules of “autonomy”, of major errors in judgment, and of lack of success. He has mounted his operation from and maintained his bases in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> territory; he has informed Tad Szulc of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, apparently in detail, of <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> support for him; he has used Szulc as a channel for making requests for further support from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> officials; he has carried out his projected operations ineptly and carelessly; and he has failed in a humiliating and noisy way.</p>
                        <p>These are grievous mistakes. Some, perhaps, can be mitigated by a plea of extenuating circumstances, but taken together they could easily justify our washing our hands of <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> and his group. There are, however, cogent reasons, in my opinion, for giving <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> another chance.</p>
                        <p>The basic argument in favor of continuing support for him is the fact that his strategic concept of political operations provides at least some hope for loosening up the situation within Cuba. As you know, his plans call for infiltration of small groups into Cuba (no hit-and-run attacks from the outside) with the object of beginning small-scale propaganda operations in urban and suburban areas, validated and reinforced by occasional sabotage. The idea is to raise a symbol of organized, coherent and gradually expanding resistance to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and to attract disaffected elements of the regime and of the mass by establishing the beginning of an alternative to the regime. Rayʼs political platform, which is certainly left of center, and an echo of the original <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0699"/>promises of the revolution, probably has greater potential for appealing to sectors of the power structure than that of any other group available to us. His proclamation of May 20 (copy attached)<note n="3" xml:id="d273fn3">Attached but not printed.</note> was, in my view, a very effective piece of political propaganda.</p>
                        <p>As it is with all exile groups, it is impossible to assess the accuracy of Rayʼs claims to support in being within Cuba. Probably the most that can be said is that, given his role in the revolution, his reasonably important post in the early days of the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime, and his general political beliefs, his claims have more plausibility than those of others. A prickly personality, <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> should not be viewed as having the leadership qualities of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Fidel</persName> nor should his movement be expected to sweep the island. Probably the most that we can prudently and realistically expect from a successful effort by <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> is a gradual loosening up of the internal structure. On the other hand, even if he gets inside and begins to work, it is entirely possible that he will lay a massive egg. We simply cannot be sure.</p>
                        <p>Basically, however, his strategic political concept has merit; it is his execution which has been miserable.</p>
                        <p>The Agency reports that JURE people say that they have learned bitter lessons from the June 1 fiasco<note n="4" xml:id="d273fn4">Regarding this episode, see <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref>.</note> and that they will not repeat them. It is entirely possible that they have been shocked into realizing the necessity for greater care and for abiding by the rules of engagement. Their pleas for our intercession with the Dominican Government stem from their knowledge that we have meant what we said when we stipulated that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> territory cannot be used as a base of operations. This has been borne in upon them with special force because they claim that a significant, if not major, part of their operational problems was caused by their inability to employ <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-based equipment which was under strict surveillance.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Rayʼs revelations to the newspaperman, there is now no way for him to correct that blunder. No amount of references to the general lack of discretion of the Cuban exile or to similar (but lesser) breaches of security by the other “autonomous” leader can justify it. The only small comfort that can be drawn in the area of security is that the Anguila Key fiasco improved the general cover for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support of JURE. Among the press in general, in fact, <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName>, because of his history, is much oftener credited with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support than <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName>. Unfortunately, Szulc is more influential and may be more ready to use his information than most. It should be noted that, if we were to intercede with the Dominicans in Rayʼs behalf, his establishment in the Dominican <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0700"/>Republic would tend to confirm to Szulc Rayʼs account to him and the hollowness of our insistence that we have not supported him.</p>
                        <p>Taking all these factors into account, I recommend that we meet Rayʼs first two requests immediately, <hi rend="italic">provided</hi> that:

                                <label>2.</label>

                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>He be made to understand that if these conditions are violated all assistance will be cut off forthwith, and in the case of a violation of the first condition, all his equipment in the United States will be seized.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Regarding intercession with the Dominican authorities, we should take no action pending the basic decision on policy toward autonomous groups in general.<note n="5" xml:id="d273fn5">According to <persName>Johnson</persName>ʼs Notes on the June 18 303 Committee Meeting, it was decided to tell <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Manuel Ray</persName> that we “agreed with him that he should operate from outside the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. He must establish a base outside, and then we will help him as we have undertaken to do. We will help him get his boat out.” <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> also noted that “On <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName>, we shall continue as we are now doing.” As for rumors of assassination plots against <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and selected Cuban leaders, <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> were to inform Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> to use U.S. law enforcement agencies to prevent such plans. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INRIL1">INR/IL</gloss> Historical Files, 5412 Special Group/303 Committee Records, June 18, 1964) <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> sent <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> an August 19 memorandum reviewing the FBIʼs investigation of reported exile assassination plans. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Exile Activities, Vol. I, 11/63–7/65)</note> If it is decided to continue support for such groups, I recommend that we do intercede but that we limit ourselves to having the appropriate officer of the Embassy (Ambassador or <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>) repeat to the President of the Triumvirate the standard formula (in effect, <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> is a respectable and dedicated Cuban exile leader) which <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> already has used in reply to an inquiry from <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid Cabral</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> himself should, of course, make the specific request to the Dominican authorities.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that he wanted to repeat to President Orlich the firm pledge of the Government of the United States to assist in any feasible way if Costa Rica were threatened by <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> Communism. U.S. help might take the form of cooperation in mounting coastal patrols and surveillance of arms shipments, cooperation between military forces or any other means appropriate to the occasion. It was firm U.S. policy to keep <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> in Cuba and to make it clear that any effort by him to subvert or to threaten other countries would encounter a prompt reaction.</p>
                        <p>President Orlich said he was providing some help to Cuban exile leaders.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the U.S. was trying to ensure that no Cuban exile activities originated on U.S. soil. Hit-and-run raids are not very effective since most of the work to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> will have to be done inside Cuba. The introduction of people into Cuba is becoming more difficult. Cuban police work is very professional, thanks to Soviet training.</p>
                        <p>President Orlich asked about the possible whereabouts of new guerrilla activities. The Secretary said this was difficult to judge. He <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0702"/>was concerned about arms being smuggled from Panama to Colombia and from Bolivia to Argentina. The Secretary said that control of arms traffic required a great deal of careful organization.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then discussed on the impact of the defection of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Fidel Castro</persName>ʼs sister, Juana. He indicated he was very much interested in her remarks regarding the use of Cuban embassies as centers of subversion. Ambassador Facio recalled that when he had visited Cuba in March 1959 in the company of President Orlich and <persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">Jose Figueres</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs sister apologized for the sharp exchanges which took place at that time between <persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">Figueres</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and remarked to the Costa Rican group that she greatly feared communist penetration of the July 26 movement.</p>
                        <p>There was general agreement that the increasing number of Soviet trained students from Central America and other areas represented a threat. It was noted that the Costa Rican Government has tried by publicizing names of those taking such training to cut down the flow. The Secretary asked if the Government of Costa Rica had lists of all those who had been trained by communists, and urged that the Government continue to keep an eye on them after their return.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred to the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Foreign Ministerʼs meeting in Washington and said that while it appeared there would be sufficient votes on the present version of the Venezuelan resolution, he would appreciate continued Costa Rican efforts to try to influence the two or three nations still opposed to action. President Orlich and Foreign Minister Oduber said that they would continue their efforts. There was also general agreement that the resolutions should not be further watered down. The Secretary said that the recommendations by nations of the hemisphere to nations outside the hemisphere that they cut off commercial relations with Cuba, if approved, would have a very significant impact on European nations now trading with Cuba. The volume of their trade with Cuba is small. They would probably think twice about continuing Cuban trade if it were in any way to jeopardize their much greater trade with the rest of Latin America.</p>

                            <item>The regimeʼs economic performance—still dismal after five and a half years of trying—has resulted in a continuing loss of popular backing. Living conditions are depressed; rationing has become a way of life; and the administration and management continue to be both inept and high-handed. In short, the regime has failed to deliver the economic benefits that it promised, and the consequences of this failure are increasingly felt by most of the Cuban population. Moreover, we expect little, if any, increase in overall economic output during the rest of 1964 or in 1965. Indeed shortages of foodstuffs and consumer goods are likely to become even more pronounced.<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2">It is worth noting that the Cuban economic plan for 1964 calls for only a 1.3 percent increase over 1963 in the total amount of food available for consumption. Even if this target is achieved—and the Cubans have not often met plan goals in the past—this would mean a small decline in <hi rend="italic">per capita consumption</hi>, since the population is almost certainly increasing at a substantially greater rate.

                            <item>We estimate Cuban sugar production in 1964 at about 3.8 million metric tons—the same as the 1963 crop, which was the smallest in 18 years. Cuban export earnings this year, however, while slightly below those of 1960 and 1961, will be substantially better than in 1962 and 1963 because of the abnormally high prices at which most of the 1964 crop was sold on future contracts during 1963.</item>

                            <item>Recent sharp declines in sugar futures make Cuban prospects for foreign exchange earnings much less promising for 1965, and probably for 1966 as well. World spot prices, which had hit a peak of 13 cents a pound a little more than a year ago and were still as high as 12 cents last November, now are not much above five cents; sugar futures for 1965 are running at 4.5 to 4.6 cents. Assuming that sales to non-bloc <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0704"/>purchasers are made at about these levels, the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime would not only have to expand sugar production by about 20 percent next year to earn as much in 1965 as this year; it would also have to sell the entire increase to the bloc at the six-cent price specified for Soviet purchases in the long-term Soviet-Cuban sugar agreement. Such an expansion of production would be possible, but unlikely. The regimeʼs program of canefield expansion—carried out at the expense of other crops—may permit a modest expansion in the 1965 sugar crop, but we believe there is no more than a remote chance that the 1965 harvest will be large enough to produce export earnings significantly above those of this year.</item>

                            <item>Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> is pressing ahead with his program of socialization, relying increasingly on methods of compulsion and repression in carrying it out. The Cuban leaders are applying some measures borrowed from the Soviet bloc without successfully adapting them to Cuban characteristics; they are not putting enough cha-cha-cha in a system [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] likes to refer to as “Marxism cha-cha-cha.” The three government actions undertaken during the past year which have produced the strongest adverse reactions among large segments of the population have been the Second Agrarian Reform law (expropriating virtually all farms over 165 acres), the Work Norm and Wage Classification law (aimed at forcing an increase in worker productivity), and the Obligatory Military Service law (creating a disciplinary institution to handle uncooperative youth and to provide cheap forced-labor brigades, as well as to maintain the strength of the military services).</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> has not been able to put an end to internal anti-regime activity. Small guerrilla bands continue to operate in the mountainous areas of Las Villas, Camaguey, and Oriente provinces. Covert and “accidental” sabotage by workers has been a factor in low productivity rates. The regime seems particularly concerned that an expansion of guerrilla activities in conjunction with a successful landing by Cuban exiles could trigger some kind of local revolt. We do not believe that the present capabilities of the exiles justify this fear, but we do think the fear is real. Indeed, it was almost certainly the primary reason for the extensive Cuban military alert and mobilization that took place in May.</item>

                            <item>The very fact that the regime is nervous and has moved during recent weeks to arrest and deal ruthlessly with small numbers of suspected agents and other opponents has probably increased its short-term security. The large and increasing number of potential opponents of the regime within the country has never had much opportunity to organize for any unified action. The elaborate internal security machinery which now exists makes such organizational activity even more difficult and dangerous.</item>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs Cuba has taken on the character of a police state. The national intelligence and security organization, the Department of State Security, with an estimated personnel strength of several thousand, maintains units throughout the country and has apparently been effective in infiltrating and exposing counter-revolutionary groups. It works closely with the huge and ubiquitous organization of volunteer informants—the Committee for the Defense of the Revolution. These informants appear to be active in almost every block of every Cuban city and claim the Committee has a membership of almost a million and a half. In addition to spying and reporting on their neighbors, they distribute food rationing cards, hand out propaganda, and organize “voluntary work” groups. A parallel informantsʼ role among the youth, particularly among students, is carried out by the Union of Young Communists.</p>

In the very same interview he said he would continue moral support to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>/Communist groups in Latin America. His whole record is one of broken promises and duplicity. We do not believe a Communist will renounce the world revolution.

                                <item>We continue to believe as Thomas Jefferson did that people have a right to change their government if it no longer represents them. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> argued this himself when he was fighting to overthrow Batista.

                        <p>The President has requested that a careful study be made of all aspects of the problem of maintaining adequate assurance against an attempted reintroduction of offensive missiles into Cuba. He requests that this study be undertaken by representatives of the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and the Director of Central Intelligence, with the State Department representative as chairman.</p>
                        <p>This inquiry should assess such questions as (1) the probability and prospect of a renewed Soviet attempt to introduce missiles, (2) the different levels of assurance which might be achieved by various means of obtaining information, (3) the possibility that an increase or decrease in tension with Cuba might change the urgency of the problem or the availability of various means of information, (4) the various kinds of risk which various means of assurance involve, and (5) prospective changes in the “state of the art” of different methods of surveillance.</p>
                        <p>It is expected that this group will work closely with the United States Intelligence Board, with government agencies involved in research and development, and with those responsible for policy planning. It is requested also that the chairman of the group maintain liaison with my office, through Mr. Peter Jessup and with me directly, as he thinks appropriate.</p>
                        <p>It is not expected that this review group should reach final recommendations, but rather that it should examine all aspects of this question and prepare a report showing as clearly as possible the various courses, with their premises and consequences, which may be available to the U.S. in the future. After a preliminary survey the chairman and I will agree on a completion date for this study.</p>

                        <p>We have consistently maintained the position that it is not in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interest to recognize a Cuban government-in-exile. The most formal public expression of our views was made by Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MJB1">Martin</persName> in testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Refugees and Escapees on May 22, 1963. He gave the following reasons for our stand:
<list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>
                                    <p>Recognition of a government-in-exile would give those in Cuba who are struggling against communism, or who might be disposed to turn against the regime, the idea that they are being disregarded and that they will have no role to play in determining how Cuba will be governed.</p>
                                    <p>A fundamental premise of our policy is that the Cuban people themselves will decide how they will achieve and organize their freedom and that those now within Cuba must have the major share of that responsibility.</p>
                                </item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The problem of finding a government capable of uniting a majority of the exiles is a most difficult, if not impossible task.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Our consistent policy has been to recognize governments-inexile only when they have direct constitutional connection with the last constituted government of the country, usually when they have actually exercised power in the country just prior to being forced out.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>We still recognize the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime as the Cuban Government (although we have broken diplomatic relations) and as such, responsible for its international obligations, including the protection of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> citizens and the recognition of our rights under the Guantanamo Treaty. To recognize a government-in-exile might put those rights in legal jeopardy.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition to these publicly stated reasons, the following other considerations are pertinent:
<list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>There is a better than even chance that a government-in-exile would fall under the control of old-line, discredited Cuban politicians <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0709"/>who constitute a numerous, aggressive and often well-financed element of the Cuban exile community. Such figures have very little, if any, support within Cuba. Our experiences in the 1961–1962 period with the Cuban Revolutionary Council—the nearest thing to a government-in-exile—are a poor augury for relations with an even more formal body.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>If an acceptable alternative to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> should arise within Cuba as a result of internal developments and should establish itself physically in some form as a provisional government, our ability to recognize it would be made much more difficult if we were already in relations with a government-in-exile.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>A government-in-exile would claim Cubaʼs seat in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. We would have to support its being seated. There are Latin American Governments, such as Mexico and Chile, which would not recognize the exile government and oppose its participation in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. This would place serious strains on the inter-American system. The exile government would probably also try to obtain representation in world bodies. Few, if any, of our Western European allies would recognize the government or support its replacement of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> representatives in these organizations. This could prove highly embarrassing to us.</item>

                        <p>Other than preventing <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> from bringing suit in the United States and claiming sovereign immunity in connection therewith, about the only advantage to be derived from recognition of a Cuban exile government would be to remove the legal obstacles to giving exile groups financial and material support for their activities against the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime. Given the preponderant strength of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs military forces in relation to what the exile government could muster, our decision to support the exiles would only make sense in the context of a broader determination on our part to take direct action against the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion the foregoing considerations very clearly add up to our maintaining, in the absence of a clear decision to move directly against the present regime, the negative stand on recognition of a Cuban government-in-exile.</p>

                        <p>On July 26, 1964, at the conclusion of the Ninth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of American States, held at the Pan American Union in Washington, the Ministers signed a Final Act in response to Venezuelaʼs complaint of December 3, 1963, against Cuba, after the latter was found to have positioned an arms cache in the territory of the former. The Foreign Ministers found that the Government of Cuba had directed and sponsored subversion against Venezuela and that such subversion was an act of intervention and aggression. Among other things, it adopted the following measures:

                        <p>3. I reported on the withdrawals from Cuba following the substance of the attached memorandum. I specifically stated that we could not say positively that surface-to-air missiles had been turned over to the Cubans; there was no way to know whether or not the Soviets “kept a finger on the trigger”. I said that I believed that Khrushchev did not want a confrontation with the United States, that he knew such a confrontation would be created by a shootdown of the U–2 and that I would be very surprised if he felt sufficiently confident in <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs ability and veracity to turn these weapons over to him unrestricted with all of the consequences if <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> should use them in an emotional fit of anger. I said that intelligence could not reveal the true situation, other than this we felt that all military units have been withdrawn from Cuba, that all equipment was now in Cuban hands, that the communications systems except for one Navy link were operated by the Cubans, and that the 1500 to 2500 remaining Soviets were military advisors.</p>

                                <item>Since the missile crisis of 1962, some 20,000 Soviet military personnel have left Cuba in four major withdrawal periods, the peaks of which occurred in November 1962, March 1963, November 1963, and June 1964. About 5,000 personnel were withdrawn during each of these periods, the most recent period extending from early May to the present during which time 14 Soviet passenger ships sailed between Cuba and the USSR.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>At the end of 1963, as the result of an examination of the probable number of Soviet military personnel believed to have been withdrawn from Cuba since the estimated high of 22,500 troops in October 1962 and of the probable Soviet personnel strength in each of the <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0712"/>weapon systems remaining on the island, we estimated that as many as seven thousand Soviet servicemen remained.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Since that estimate was made, twenty Soviet passenger ships have called at Cuban ports, 14 of them in the last three months. Few military passengers were on the ships calling between January and April, and military personnel departures were probably offset by arrivals. Extra ships were scheduled beginning in May, however, and at least 5,000 Soviet military personnel along with a few dependents, agricultural technicians, and Cuban students departed Cuba for the USSR. No more than 800 passengers are known to have arrived in Cuba on these 14 ships, and almost all of these were Cubans who arrived on the last two ships.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>We believe that the last major withdrawal of Soviet military personnel has now been completed, and that only about 2,000 Soviet military technicians and advisors remain on the island. All Soviet communications links within Cuba (except for one naval link which will probably terminate operations this week) have been deactivated or turned over to the Cubans, and Cuban forces have apparently assumed full control over the operation of all Soviet weapons remaining on the island. No Soviet operational or combat units are known to be on the island.</item>

                        <list>
                            <label>A.</label>
                            <item>Though the downward trend of the Cuban economy seems to have slowed and perhaps levelled off, we believe the economic situation will be stagnant over the next two years. Inept management and low labor morale will persist. Living levels are likely to become slightly lower, and shortages of foodstuffs, housing and many types of consumer goods will continue. Slight gains in industry are likely, but these will probably be offset by some decline in the agricultural sector. (Paras. 3–7, 9–13, 17–19)</item>
                            <label>B.</label>
                            <item>Export earnings in 1965 and 1966 are likely to be below 1964 levels, because of lower sugar prices and poor prospects for substantially larger production of sugar and other export commodities. The value of total trade with the Free World can be expected to decline during the period. We believe that the Soviets and other Communist countries will provide sufficient credit assistance to prevent a seriously damaging drop in total imports. In these circumstances, Cubaʼs heavy economic dependence on the Communist world will continue. (Paras. 8, 14–16)</item>
                            <label>C.</label>
                            <item>Depressed levels of consumption, the imposition of work norms, and forced labor and security duties will tend to narrow the regimeʼs popular support. However, the huge security apparatus will almost certainly prevent popular dissatisfaction from bringing down the regime. We think it likely that a number of military officers have lost sympathy with certain of its policies, but we doubt that there is military disaffection on a scale sufficient to threaten <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. Major deterioration in the internal situation or serious difficulties within the government could alter the picture, but would be unlikely to undermine <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs power position in less than several years. We believe his death would lead, in fairly short order, to a power struggle of unpredictable outcome. (Paras. 20–36)</item>
                            <label>D.</label>
                            <item>The Cuban armed forces are much the best-equipped in Latin America and, except for Brazil, the largest. Their capabilities have continued to improve, chiefly as a result of the delivery of additional weapons from the USSR and Cuban acquisition of weapon systems formerly under Soviet control. The compulsory military service program, introduced last November, will probably cause an initial drop in the level of training and efficiency, but will permit improved selectivity of recruits for the active forces, and will eventually produce a much larger trained reserve. (Paras. 37–43)</item>
                            <label>E.</label>
                            <item>There are almost certainly no Russian combat units still in Cuba. Upon completion of current withdrawals, a Soviet <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>-type presence, mostly technical and maintenance personnel, of about 2,000 will probably remain so long as the Cuban armed forces remain dependent on the USSR for technical and material support to maintain their complex Soviet equipment. (Paras. 44–45)</item>

                            <label>F.</label>
                            <item>During the period of this estimate, the Soviets are highly unlikely to reintroduce strategic weapons into Cuba, though they have the technical capability to do so clandestinely. They might use Cuba for support of their submarines, but so long as they calculate that the risk would be high, they would not push such a venture very far. (Paras. 46–47)</item>
                            <label>G.</label>
                            <item>The Cuba-Soviet relationship remains intact, although frictions have continued. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, though willing to lean to the side of the Soviets in the Sino-Soviet dispute, has refused to join in any formal condemnation of Peiping. He is concerned lest a further improvement in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations leave his regime more isolated and exposed. Though the Soviets almost certainly consider <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> to be erratic and undependable, they have little choice but to continue to support him. (Paras. 48–52)</item>
                            <label>H.</label>
                            <item>The most explosive question in Soviet-Cuban relations, as well as between <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, is the continuation of U–2 overflights. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and Khrushchev have conducted a program of warnings, threats, and compromise suggestions to induce the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to desist. It is almost certain that Cuba now has full control over the SAM system—and consequently the capability to shoot down a U–2. Thus we believe that the Soviets can only give advice, backed up by their political and economic leverage, though we cannot wholly exclude the possibility that they have retained some sort of physical restraint on an actual firing. Nevertheless, we believe that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> does not intend to force the issue until after the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> elections, when he will seek UN action. If this fails, there is considerable danger that he would order a shootdown, calculating that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would not retaliate in force or that, if it did, the resulting hue and cry would end the overflights. An impulsive reaction by <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> or even an unauthorized shootdown is always possible. (Paras. 44, 53–56)</item>
                            <label>I.</label>
                            <item>
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> has a serious interest in improving relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, as a means of reducing the pressures on his regime. He probably also considers that his recent gestures are useful to build a record of Cuban reasonableness and flexibility in preparation for Cubaʼs appeal to the UN on the U–2 issue. He will probably make further overtures from time to time, but there is little chance that he will accede at any early date to the conditions the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has stated. (Paras. 57–58)</item>
                            <label>J.</label>
                            <item>
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs efforts to foment revolution in Latin America have suffered setbacks during the past year. He is probably somewhat less sanguine about the chances for quick success. Nevertheless, he will almost certainly continue to provide aid and subversive training to potential revolutionaries. He may press for early aggressive action by some <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castroist</persName> groups, even though their immediate chances seem poor, hoping that their repression would eventually produce conditions more favorable for exploitation.

                            <item>Present statistics indicate that Free World exports to Cuba in 1964 will show an increase of roughly 80% over the 1963 figures. So far the domestic press has not focussed on this issue but there are indicators that our good luck will not hold out much longer. State tells me that there are reporters in town who are beginning to snoop around for current statistics on Free World trade with Cuba, which are unclassified and which are available at Commerce or at the IMF. Eventually, we should probably expect the Republicans to use the figures to point up the Administrationʼs “ineffective isolation policy, etc., etc.” (We may also get some heat on specific trade deals that are consummated—e.g. a UK/Cuba deal for $4.5 million of locomotives is coming down the road which we canʼt stop.)</item>

                                <p>These measures, if implemented, may or may not be effective in reducing trade with Cuba over the long term. Over the short term (between now and November) they will help only marginally in making the 1964 statistics more tolerable than they now appear to be.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I have no strong feelings about the immigration status of Cuban exiles taking part in anti-<persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> activities outside United Statesʼ territories. And I understand the political risks in rocking the boat at this time.</p>
                        <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0717"/>
                        <p>After the first of the year I do believe, however, that we should have another look at whether our interests are served by Cuban exile activities based in other American republics. I have in mind two principal questions:</p>
                        <p>First, I question whether the activities of the Cuban exiles do any real harm to the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime and specifically whether the assertion that these activities are a morale builder for the anti-<persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> Cubans inside Cuba is still valid. Rather I think we may now have reached the point where these activities are on balance helpful to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> by giving him a pretext for appealing to the patriotism of the Cubans and presenting himself as the defender of Cuban sovereignty against the Colossus of the North.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, I find that United States policy is astride two horses each veering off in different directions. In the Foreign Ministersʼ Meeting we took the position that the subversive activities in Venezuela amounted to Cuban aggression. It will become increasingly difficult to maintain this line and at the same time try to downplay the importance of extra legal activities directed against <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and designed to bring about his overthrow.</p>
                        <p>I donʼt have any final opinions about these two questions. I only say we should have a careful look at them in the not-too-distant future.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that he wished again to raise the matter of Cuba, since there were two new elements in the situation. The first was the <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0718"/>meeting of the Ministers of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> in July and the second was the decline of Cubaʼs credit rating. World sugar prices had come down from abnormal levels, Cuban production was down, and the Government of Cuba had to recognize that it had overreached its capabilities. The <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Ministers, concerned at continuing Cuban interference in their internal affairs, were inclined to go even further than the decisions they did take and our role in the meeting to some extent had been to restrain them from extreme measures. Feelings were very strong in the hemisphere and it was hoped that friends would help with the problem. The resolution which was adopted nearly exhausted peaceful remedies and the hemisphere was determined that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> must stop his troublemaking. We wanted to see these peaceful means effective. They could not be effective without general participation and we looked to others to help in avoiding opportunities for Cuba to escape from pressure.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he did not wish to suggest that Italy had not been helpful. We noted that Italian trade with Cuba was small and Italian imports were down but exports were up. We also appreciated Italian support in NAC and FIATʼs responsiveness to our concern about their Cuban deal. Furthermore, Italian shipping companies had been helpful in assuring that their ships would be out of Cuba trade by the end of the year. The Secretary said that we might at some future time take up the matter again in NATO and wanted the Ambassador to have this background for the information of his Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there were two aspects of the problem which were not negotiable. The first was the presence of the Soviet military in Cuba and the second was Cuban interference in the affairs of other countries. There had recently been substantial reduction in the number of Soviet forces there. We believed that something in the neighborhood of two thousand remain. These were largely technicians and advisers and did not appear to be organized into units. Two thousand was still too many. We had no evidence at all that the Cubans were changing their policy to end interference in other countries. They were active and in close contact with the Soviets. Their providing of agents and funds to create unrest continued. With the termination of diplomatic relations, the misuse of their embassies was decreasing. The Ambassador said that he had heard that the United States preferred that some Soviet troops remain in Cuba as a moderating influence. The Secretary said that this was a misinterpretation. We had only expressed our concern that, after Soviet withdrawal, sophisticated arms would remain in Cuban hands and that they might use them irresponsibly. He concluded that the Soviet presence in Cuba cuts across a hundred and fifty years of history and that stability could not be achieved as long as it continued.</p>
                        <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0719"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he would report the Secretaryʼs remarks faithfully. The Ambassador referred to the elections in Chile. He and the Secretary agreed on the importance which Freiʼs victory could have as a rebuff to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> who had made an enormous effort in support of Allende.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador remarked that some countries lacked legal means of enforcing restrictions on trade with Cuba. He asked whether we envisaged some sort of collective NATO action. The Secretary said we did not have such collective action in mind now and that the means and problems would be different in every country. One tool generally available to governments was the possibility of refusing to guarantee credits for trade with Cuba.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> scheduled a series of meetings with Ambassadors from Italy, Canada, Spain, United Kingdom, France, Lebanon, Japan, Portugal, Belgium, Sweden, Netherlands, and West Germany to discuss the results of the Meeting of <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Foreign Ministers on Cuba, with special reference to the question of trade. The Italian Ambassador was the first one seen (<ref target="#d284">Document 284</ref>), followed by the Spanish Ambassador (<ref target="#d286">Document 286</ref>) and the Canadian Ambassador on September 9, and the others later in the month. Memoranda of conversation for most of these meetings are in the National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 2 CUBA.</p>
                        <p>In his meetings with the French Ambassador on September 10, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> again mentioned the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> meeting on Cuba and its trade resolutions. The Ambassador responded that French trade with Cuba was insignificant. The Secretary then mentioned reports that a French deal seemed to be in progress with Benoto for earth moving equipment and “that French trade with Cuba was up significantly this year.” (Memorandum of conversation, September 10; ibid., POL 1 CUBA)</p>
                        <p>In his meeting with the Belgian Ambassador on September 15, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> mentioned “the virtual collapse of Cuban credit” as a factor that “might provide a basis” for the trading countries “to reassess the situation.” The Ambassador described his last conversation with the Secretary concerning Cuba on February 19 and recalled that at that time <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had expressed concern about the sale of Belgian locomotives to Cuba. The Ambassador stated that “On the basis of this conversation the Belgian Government had intervened to block credit for that sale, because of its desire to work closely with” the United States.

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to take up with the Ambassador, as he was doing with the Ambassadors of several other countries, the Cuban problem in the light of the deliberations of the Meeting of <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Foreign Ministers (<gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss>) in July. He said that, although the immediate issue in the July meeting had been Cubaʼs interference in Venezuela, several Ministers in the course of the meeting had referred to Cuban activities in their countries also. The seriousness with which the Ministers viewed Cuban interference was demonstrated by the fact that the sanctions imposed on Cuba about exhausted the peaceful measures which remained available to the inter-American system. The Ministers hoped that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> would heed the warning and thus avoid a dangerous situation. The Secretary pointed out that for our part we had made repeatedly clear to Cuba and the USSR that one of the two nonnegotiable elements in any discussion of improved U.S.-Cuban relations was the cessation of Cuban interference; the other was the Soviet military presence in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the paragraph of the basic resolution of the <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss> which sought demonstrations of solidarity from non-<gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> states. He pointed out that this measure, like the others adopted at the meeting, was not imposed by the U.S. but arose from the serious concern and initiative of the Latin members of the Alliance. The Secretary added that, in fact, the paragraph as finally adopted represented a moderation of a proposal, which at one point was favored by a majority, to interrupt trade by <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> members with countries trading with Cuba.</p>
                        <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0721"/>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that there was considerable good evidence that the Cuban Government was facing foreign exchange stringencies as a result of the sharp drop in world sugar prices, low sugar production and possible over-extension of purchasing in the Free World. He commented that the Cuban credit position would be correspondingly impaired.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to call the attention of the Government of Spain to the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> resolution and its background with the hope that that Government would look at the Cuban problem in this perspective to see if there were ways of indicating its solidarity with the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> countries. He complimented the Spanish Foreign Minister on his remarkable achievements in recent years in creating a new respect for Spain, particularly among the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> countries. He made clear that he did not wish to urge any particular steps on the Spanish Government but to suggest their earnest consideration of the new situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that the Spanish Government might wish to review its trade relations with Cuba. He noted that Spainʼs commerce with Cuba was substantially higher than a year ago. The Ambassador attributed Spainʼs increased purchases of Cuban sugar to the drop in the Spanish sugar beet crop; he expressed the belief that this yearʼs crop would be better. In response to the Ambassadorʼs question, the Secretary said that Soviet aid to Cuba continued to be substantial, but the Cuban economy continued to decline, with the supply of spare parts, for example, becoming an increasingly important matter.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether there had been concrete results from the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Ministerial Meeting yet. The Secretary pointed to the closing of three Cuban Embassies which <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs sister had described as “nests of subversion” in Latin America. He added that we were not overly concerned that Mexico had not yet broken relations, since some of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> states had seen some advantage in keeping at least one Latin American Embassy in Havana for purposes of asylum and observation. We did not know what Mexicoʼs further steps might be but the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> members were not unduly disquieted by Mexicoʼs position at present. The Ambassador asked whether the President would take this matter up with the President of Mexico when they meet. The Secretary said he thought not since the situation had just been discussed at the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> meeting and, with a change in government due in December, it seemed improbable that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> would take this up with President Lopez Mateos.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador remarked that Spain had been able to rescue many Cubans. For instance, a plane load of 81 refugees had been flown out this week, including some who had been condemned to death. The Secretary recognized that Spain had some special problems in Cuba. <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0722"/>He suggested that because of its special relationship it might be possible for the Government of Spain to speak frankly to the Cubans to tell them that they must stop their interference in other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether we had evidence of further arms shipments from Cuba into other countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> said that Venezuela was the only well-established, large-scale case but that there were some other indications of Cuban arms on a minor scale, for example in northern Argentina.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary repeated that he hoped the Government of Spain would take a new look at the situation and measures which it might take in the light of the position adopted by the <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss> and the further decline in Cuban creditworthiness. The Ambassador said he would report his conversation with the Secretary faithfully to his Government.<note n="2" xml:id="d286fn2">In a meeting on October 28 the Spanish Ambassador informed <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> “that Spanish ships are now being removed from Cuban trade.” (Memorandum of conversation, October 28; ibid., Secretaryʼs Memcons, 1961–64: Lot 65 D 330, October 1964)</note>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> came in to see me today pursuant to an appointment which he had made almost a week ago. He said he wished to talk to me entirely on a personal basis about Cuba. His remarks were rather vague but his purpose seemed to be to express concern about raids on Cuba, the training of emigrant groups in Central America and elsewhere, and some rumor that some Central American countries <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0723"/>might take some forceful action<note n="2" xml:id="d287fn2">J.C. King of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>ʼs Deputy Directorate of Plans met with Nicaraguaʼs dictator, General Anastasio Somoza, on September 17 at Friendship Airport in Miami. King told Somoza that he “could count on a sympathetic understanding in Washington” if he dropped his support for <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName>. (Memorandum for the record, September 17; ibid.) According to the minutes of a joint <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> meeting on October 1, <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> said that Somoza told King he had information that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> would attack the exile camps in Nicaragua and they would expect the United States to respond. <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> saw this as a Somoza entrapment ploy. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> “made it clear he wanted no such move on Somozaʼs part and directed that Somoza be so informed.” (<gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Weekly Meeting memorandum, October 1; Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INRIL1">INR/IL</gloss> Historical Files)</note> before the end of the year. In the course of the conversation, he mentioned the <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> group and another exile leader whose name he said he thought was Olivo.</p>
                        <p>I said that as he knew we had expressed ourselves as being opposed to these hit-and-run raids and pointed out how embarrassing it was to us that a Spanish ship had been sunk.<note n="3" xml:id="d287fn3">The <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> exile group had sunk a Spanish ship, the <hi rend="italic">Sierra Aranzazu</hi>, in mid-September. According to the Minutes of the Meeting of the 303 Committee of September 25, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had assured the Spanish Ambassador that the United States would assist in the investigation of the incident. At the same meeting it “was generally agreed that the U.S. should not lend weight to the case against <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> and the findings should remain ‘as indeterminate as is plausible.’” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_INRIL1">INR/IL</gloss> Historical Files, 5412 Special Group/303 Committee Records)</note> I said I had not heard of the rumor of a Central American-supported action before the end of the year, and did not think it was true. I said we had taken strict measures to prevent the use of our territory by these groups and understood that these measures had been effective.</p>
                        <p>When he expressed surprise that a Spanish ship could have been sunk in view of the air and sea power we had in the area, I pointed out that we could scarcely get into the position of escorting ships to Cuba in view of our overall policy. He said he could understand this. He indicated that the Soviet Government had remained relatively quiet about the activities directed against Cuba as they did not wish to inject this issue into the American political campaign. I said that in conclusion that while I assumed that all of our policies would be under review after the election, I did not believe there would be any change in our attitude toward hit-and-run raids on Cuba.</p>

                        <p>You have asked for a sit rep on the committee established by NSAM 311. My present judgment is that it has bogged down, not because of personality differences and interagency disagreements, but rather because of unresolved technical problems which prevent the accurate judgment factor from being applied.</p>
                        <p>These amount to:

                        <p>Another factor may be that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, a reflective thinker out loud, may lack the two-fisted authoritarian approach required to hammer out the kind of a paper you want from this committee consisting of <persName corresp="#p_HTL1">Tom Hughes</persName>, Kitchen, Weiss and Lindjord for State, <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Manuel Ray</persName> Cline for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and Brig.

                        <p>When I can catch <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Ray</persName> Cline I will get additional insight.</p>
                        <p>I would recommend that the work of this committee be further refined now that the election period is over. In other words, the question should be can we live after November 4th with any degree of lessened <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0725"/>assurance. The committee should dispense with such matters as what to do after a shootdown, etc. etc. and concentrate on what are the minimal requirements and what are the minimal means to dissatisfy these. Our 303 Committee could generate the answers to the technical problems by direct orders. These are the problems which have the NSAM committee floundering. The time is getting short; the UN may debate the matter before we have your paper.</p>

John is now working on a paper of talking points he will use with the Spanish (he wants to keep it oral if possible). The general pitch he will probably want to use will take into account such facts as (a) that we want to give the Spanish the minimum necessary to keep them from thinking that we are trying to deceive them and (b) that the Spanish, themselves, probably evaluate <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> as the prime suspect. Specifically, such points as the following might be made to the Spanish: <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, while we cannot rule out the possibility that the Cubans sunk the <hi rend="italic">Aranzazu</hi>, it is probably more likely that the <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0726"/>exiles did it. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, there are a number of exile groups that have the capability of doing the job. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, the most likely of the exile groups is probably <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName>. But the fact that <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName>ʼs boat was in Curacao would seem to rule him out; and even if this could be explained, we could still not prove that <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> is the culprit. <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, (if pressed) by a process of elimination, the attack would seem to have come from the Dominican Republic<note n="2" xml:id="d289fn2">In a November 21 memorandum <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> noted that a “large number of FBI reports of interrogations of Cuban exiles in Miami and Puerto Rico” had been passed to the Spanish. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> said that he would tell the Spanish that “We are quite satisfied” that the attack did not come from Jamaica or Haiti and that “we are certain it did not come from Puerto Rico.” (Ibid.)</note> (the Spanish already strongly suspect this—see attached cable).<note n="3" xml:id="d289fn3">Telegram 519 from Santo Domingo, November 3; attached but not printed.</note> In any event, we are sure it did not come from the U.S.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Special Group Items</hi>—Des mentioned that a dissident group [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] inside Cuba have contacted <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName>ʼs people; reportedly, they have picked <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> because they feel that anyone with his resources must have the support of the U.S. Government. Des feels that we should let this contact develop and, in this connection, he believes that the Special Group should permit the continuance of our support to <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> for another 60 or 90 days and, if absolutely necessary, allow <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> to make one more attack (more or less controlled by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>) on Cuba. If we drop <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> precipitously, the dissident group in Cuba will assume that <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> is not worth contacting and their willingness to express dissidence may tend to dry up. In all of this discussion, Des emphasized that he is no great admirer of <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> and that the above is not an Agency device to keep <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName>ʼs group alive. This item will probably come before the Special Group on Thursday.<note n="4" xml:id="d289fn4">According to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>ʼs notes on the 303 Committee meeting on November 12, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> proposal was approved with Department of State support.

                                <p>Des also mentioned the possibility of passing on to Dorticos, in an unattributable, deniable fashion, the message that, while the U.S. cannot live with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Fidel Castro</persName>, it might well be able to live with Dorticos. Des feels that Cuba is in terrible shape, that Dorticos knows it, and that a move like this could conceivably produce a big dividend. At best, it will start Dorticos plotting; at worst, (if <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> finds out) it will help to sow some seeds of dissension and distrust. This item will probably come up at a later Special Group meeting.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Erosion of Cuban Economy</hi>—Des was very hopeful that Cuba will be in very bad economic shape by the end of 1965. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]; some of this is going in already, and some is on the way. Emphasizing the extreme sensitivity of the operation, Des said that the effect on large amounts of Cuban machinery could be brutal.</p>
                                <p>The point was made that there was, these days, a general recognition by the European missions in Cuba that the Cuban economic situation is grim and that, in fact, the isolation policy is not entirely a farce. To some extent, this realization coincided with the timing of the recent Cuban restrictions on credit.</p>

The Secretary has asked John to look into the desirability of this. The initial feeling of the group was that it was not a good idea.

                                    <hi rend="italic">Basic Review of Cuban Policy</hi>—The group agreed that, with November 3 behind us, we can usefully do some basic review work on Cuba. To this end, <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">John Crimmins</persName> agreed to write a paper which would outline the major problems and the possible options, including accommodation.

                                <p>Des <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> said we should consider the re-institution, in the near future, of the “unilateral”<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-directed covert program which had scored a number of hits last year. The group agreed, however, that a decision on this should probably wait until some of the basic review work on Cuba had been completed.</p>

                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Cuba</hi>. In attendance: Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> outlined the work done by the <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> Committee on the question of overflights of Cuba,<note n="2" xml:id="d290fn2">See <ref target="#d277">Documents 277</ref> and <ref target="#d288">288</ref>.</note> explaining the position that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> had taken, forecasting debate in the United Nations, and explaining briefly the alternatives open to us such as satellites, drones, balloons, the Oxcart, or a mixing of all of these.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName> advocated satellites, suggesting consideration of a launch pad at Cape <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> for an East-West satellite mission.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then asked for an explanation by me of a plan developed by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to fly over the unprotected zones. I explained the plan in considerable detail, using maps indicating that U–2ʼs could fly and photograph 80% of the island and remain out of range of the SAMʼs. However, this would only cover 30% of the priority targets and would not cover the major military or population concentrations. I indicated that the mounting of a satellite 112–B camera for oblique photography would give us useable photography over all of the defended areas with resolution of about 5. This would be better than satellites and could be synchronized with weather. I raised the danger of the redeployment of SAMʼs, indicating that such a move by <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> could be detected by the U–2ʼs if they were equipped with available warning systems. I concluded by stating that I had less confidence in the product from satellites than indicated by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS1">McNamara</persName>, that the use of satellites over Cuba would deprive us of some capability over USSR and Communist China, and it would be impossible to refute stories of missiles in Cuba on the basis of satellite photography. I explained in <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0729"/>some detail the innumerable times I had gone before Committees of Congress to discuss Cuban missile rumors and had been able to disprove them satisfactorily with U–2 photography. This, I said, could not be done with satellites. The President asked if I was positive that there were no missiles in Cuba. I replied you could not absolutely prove the negative; we were satisfied that all missiles which we had seen had been removed; all missile sites under construction had been destroyed and were non-existent; all secure areas obviously built for nuclear warhead storage had been destroyed and no new ones had appeared. Finally, the redeployment of the SAMʼs, which left the logical missile-launching areas unprotected, made me think the Cubans and the Soviets did not intend to reintroduce missiles at the present time.</p>
                        <p>There was no decision except to explore the subject further and to continue U–2 surveillance on the most modest reasonable basis subject to further review before or during the UN debate.</p>

                            <p rend="flushleft">

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> made two important observations: First, that he felt that the purpose of reconnaissance over Cuba was to produce intelligence on the presence of, or the introduction of, offensive missiles, offensive aircraft or other weapons or weapons systems of sufficient range to pose a threat to the security of the United States. Requirements for overflights, whether by manned aircraft, satellites, balloons, drones, etc., should be governed by this criteria. Collateral intelligence would be useful, such as information on military encampments, equipment, deployments, economic developments, etc., in studying Cuba, but should not govern as criteria for establishing requirements for reconnaissance.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: This criteria should be passed to <gloss target="#t_COMOR1">COMOR</gloss> and should be discussed with General Carroll.</p>
                            <p>Secondly, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that he had had a long meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and had been told that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> had stopped all subversive activities and efforts against Latin America and had insisted to the Soviets that neither he nor his government are engaged in any way in such nefarious operations. I stated that our information contradicted this statement as there were a number of developments which indicated acceleration in these activities by the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> Cubans.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: This criteria should be passed to <gloss target="#t_COMOR1">COMOR</gloss> and should be discussed with General Carroll.</p>

                            <p rend="center">CUBA</p>
                            <p>We continue to receive reports and rumors of missiles in Cuba and these we disprove by U–2 photography. I would expect a continuation of such rumors and also a continuation of statements by individuals or members of the Congress similar to those we have witnessed in the last two years. I have depended heavily on U–2 photography to dispel these rumors.</p>
                            <p>While satellite photography will make some input into our intelligence on Cuba, it will not be conclusive because of the resolution of KH–4 and the small area coverage of KH–7. Also we expect disappointments from satellite photography because of uncertain weather conditions encountered in Cuba and the impossibility of synchronizing satellite missions with Cuban weather. It should be noted that every mission targeted against Cuba will involve sacrifices of intelligence gathering capabilities on the Soviet Union and Communist China.</p>
                            <p>An east-west orbit would be useful but expensive and KH–4 or KH–7 missions in such an orbit, while covering Cuba more satisfactorily than the present north-south orbit, would not produce intelligence of particular interest in other parts of the world.</p>
                            <p>U–2ʼs can be flown in the safe corridors and a satellite 112–B camera can be mounted in a U–2 on an angle and thus photography of the defended areas of Cuba as well as the undefended areas can be had with photographic resolution of about 5 feet which will be useful in my opinion and better and cheaper than satellite photography with KH–4 because of resolution and KH–7 because of area coverage. This however would continue the political problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d290fn3">A notation written by <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> following this paragraph reads: “<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> discussed Cuba with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>—who says <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> has quit [subversion] against <gloss target="#t_LA1">LA</gloss> and will probably not attempt shoot down flights against missiles or main targets. This might be done by mix of means.” A memorandum of this conversation on November 18 is in <ref target="frus1964-68v14#d72">

                                    <item>JOHN will explore with selected people in State the possibility and desirability of having a USUN type (maybe <persName corresp="#p_YHW1">Yost</persName>) “fall in front of” Tabio, who is the Cuban ambassador to the UN, and say (1) that we understand from a newspaper source that Che wants to say something to us, and (2) is this true? If the answer is affirmative, we can then decide what to do. The main problem is to ascertain the truth—e.g. <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0734"/>whether Che really has something to say to us or whether this is Lisa Howard building bridges. Somewhere along the line, our man would also indicate that, if it is true that the Cubans want to talk to us, we prefer not to talk through unofficial third parties.</item>

                        <p>Senator <placeName>McCarthy</placeName> outlined the main points of his December 16 conversation with <placeName>Che Guevara</placeName>, Cuban Minister of Industry. The meeting was arranged directly with the Senator by Lisa Howard and took place in her New York apartment.</p>
                        <p>The Senator said he believed the purpose of the meeting was to express Cuban interest in trade with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> recognition of the Cuban Regime. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed this was plausible, saying that because of the state of the Cuban economy, the Cuban Regime was interested in reviving its trade relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to obtain convertible currency. Further, he felt that Guevara probably recognized that any dealings with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would add respectability to the regime in the eyes of other Latin American States.</p>
                        <p>Guevara told Senator <placeName>McCarthy</placeName> the Alliance for Progress would fail because it merely underwrites vested interests and the status quo. He said that Venezuela and the Central American States in particular needed revolutions. Chile was one state that was undertaking reforms that might make a revolution unnecessary. He noted that Chile would recognize Cuba if it were not for United States pressure.</p>
                        <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0735"/>
                        <p>Guevara did not attempt to conceal the subversive activities which Cuba was undertaking. He explicitly admitted that they were training revolutionaries and would continue to do so. He felt that this was a necessary mission for the Cuban Government since revolution offered the only hope of progress for Latin America.</p>
                        <p>Guevara attacked United Statesʼ overflights but not in particularly belligerent terms. He said that Cuba had the means to shoot down the planes, but had not taken any action against the United States. He insisted that there was no juridical basis for the overflights and that such a juridical basis was not furnished by <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> approval. Guevara mentioned only one specific “violation of sovereignty”, this being when a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> helicopter landed “over the line” (presumably at Guantanamo). He said that in this case, after some talk of firing upon the helicopter, it was permitted to leave Cuban territory.</p>
                        <p>Guevara said he knew the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was in Cuba. He stated that most of Cubaʼs enemies worked for the oil and power companies. He said the regime could identify them and they in turn knew they would be shot if they resorted to sabotage.</p>
                        <p>Guevara took issue with a statement that Ambassador Stevenson had made that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was not withholding shipments of drugs to Cuba. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> commented that drug shipments may have been cut back and that this was one area in which the Cubans could score on us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said there was no reason why we should not sell drugs or medicines to Cuba, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he would look into the matter.</p>
                        <p>Guevara told the Senator that while conditions in Cuba were not good, there was no question of the regime collapsing. On the question of refugees, he said Cubans who did not like life on the island were free to leave. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> commented that this was not true. Guevara also said the regime did not want any refugees returned to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>On relations between the Government and the Catholic Church, Guevara said they were good but that Party members could not belong to the Church. He mentioned in passing that they had more problems with Protestants than with Catholics.</p>
                        <p>On free elections, Guevara said these had not taken place because the revolution had not fully evolved. As to what form of government might eventually develop in Cuba, Guevara said—with pointed reference to Senator <placeName>McCarthy</placeName>—there was no interest in a bicameral congress or in anything along the lines of the Supreme Soviet in the USSR. He commented that the latter had no real power.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked if any references were made to Cubaʼs relationship to Moscow. It was mentioned that Lisa Howard had made the point that better relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would give Cuba a more desirable position vis-à-vis Moscow. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he believed the USSR was becoming fed up with Cuba but felt compelled to continue supporting it <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0736"/>because of its symbolic importance as the first country to go communist without pressure of the Red Army.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> emphasized the danger of meetings such as that which the Senator had had with <placeName>Guevara</placeName>. There was suspicion throughout Latin America that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> might make a deal with Cuba behind the backs of the other American States. This could provide a propaganda line useful to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out that <placeName>Guevara</placeName> could not move about without a great many people knowing where he was and whom he was seeing.<placeName>McCarthy</placeName> agreed, mentioning the large number of police cars that had gathered when he met <placeName>Guevara</placeName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked that McCarthy get in touch with him if any further contacts with <placeName>Guevara</placeName> were contemplated. Meanwhile it was essential that nothing be publicly said about the <placeName>McCarthy</placeName>–<placeName>Guevara</placeName> meeting although there was danger that <placeName>Guevara</placeName> himself might leak it.</p>

                        <p>At the request of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName>, the following amplification of the record of his remarks concerning Manuel <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> is inserted as a change on page 2 of the minutes dated 8 January 1965.<note n="2" xml:id="d296fn2">
                                <ref target="#d295">Document 295</ref>.</note> In place of paragraph 3.e. of the 8 January minutes the following paragraphs are added:</p>
                        <p>3.e. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> impressed on the Committee the difficulty of dealing with the autonomous exile groups and it was, in his opinion, extremely dangerous and of questionable effectiveness. Incidents beyond the control of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> might occur which could be very embarrassing.</p>
                        <p>f. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> explained that support of the autonomous exile groups was part of a 6-point program and that when the program was submitted, stipulation was made that the program was a package involving propaganda, psychological efforts, infiltration, directed sabotage operations, economic denial, and autonomous operations.</p>
                        <p>g. As time passed, some of the “package”, most particularly the directed sabotage operations, was discontinued for policy reasons. Hence, the effectiveness of autonomous operations has been greatly reduced and the danger of embarrassment enhanced. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> is not responsive to persuasion or direction and thus constitutes a persistent menace.</p>
                        <p>h. The Committee agreed the situation is hazardous and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> called <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> “a firecracker in our midst.”</p>
                        <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0740"/>
                        <p>Paragraph 3.f. of the minutes dated 8 January thus becomes paragraph 3.i.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of the Executive Secretary, this amplification is completely in accord with what transpired at the meeting.</p>

The individual would return to the United States, but instead of publishing anything about his Soviet visit, he would visit Florida, the Caribbean area, and Washington, trying to make it appear as if secret negotiations about Cuba had been conducted by the United States and the Soviet Union behind <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs back.

Mr. Donovan would remain unwitting. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> asked if this would not preclude Mr. Donovanʼs usefulness in other possible missions in the future.

                            <hi rend="italic">Possible British Position</hi>—We cannot be sure about British motivations in the talks, for which they took the initiative.<note n="3" xml:id="d299fn3">In a January 15 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> stated that the British Embassy, “acting on instructions from London” had inquired informally of <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> “concerning the Departmentʼs receptivity toward an informal <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–UK examination of the Cuba question.” The British added that they would be interested in inviting the Canadians to participate. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, and Assistant Secretary for European Affairs <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> agreed “that a review of the kind suggested by the British could be useful.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> initialed his approval of an informal exchange with the British and the Canadians, but added in a postscript that “In agreeing to informal discussions, it should be made clear that the U.S. has clear and far-reaching agreements with the members of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> with respect to Cuba and this factor must be fully taken into account.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL CUBA)</note> It is possible that they are approaching the discussions with an open mind, intent only upon an examination of the facts. On the other hand, they may regard the talks as the first step in a process to move us toward a relaxation of current pressures on Cuba.</p>
                        <p>If the British have the latter intention, they may advocate the line, set forth in various “think-piece” despatches written by their Ambassador in Havana, Adam Watson (whom you met last summer), that whereas our policy toward Cuba has been successful in isolating Cuba, it cannot overthrow the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime or induce any changes in his basic policies. Therefore, the British may argue it is necessary to provide inducements to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> (in addition to keeping some pressure on him) <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0745"/>in order to reduce or terminate his subversive activities and to lessen his dependence on the Soviet Union. The inducements would be (1) expanded economic and other relations with the non-<gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> West (i.e., the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would cease its objections to such ties); and (2) an end to “subversive activities” against Cuba, to be keyed to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs cessation of activities against Latin America.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, some indications that the British may have somewhat revised the assessments upon which the approach above was based, and are now thinking in more modest terms, having in mind a more limited objective and the consequent employment of narrower inducements. We may find that they will stress the single goal of preventing <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> from, as they put it, being forced irreversibly into complete dependence upon the Soviets. The means by which this would be accomplished would be the expansion of trade and other relations between Cuba and the non-<gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> West. There would be no reciprocal arrangement on subversive activities.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Recommended <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Position</hi>—The policy which the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is following arises from two key judgments: 1) the present Cuban Government has as a firm long-range goal the organization of Latin America in a form inimical to Western interests; and 2) the close association of the Soviet Union with the present regime, manifested by its dependence upon the Soviet Union for its security, constitutes an extension of Soviet power and influence into Latin America which is unacceptable to the West as a whole and particularly to the nations of this Hemisphere. Our objectives, therefore, are to prevent the present Cuban Government from attaining its own objectives in Latin America and to bring about the retraction of Soviet power and influence.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Views on Possible British Position</hi>—While we agree that an opening to the West might give <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> more independence in his dealings with the USSR, we see little or no reason to believe that this would affect his bed-rock, continuing reliance on the Soviets for basic economic support and military guarantees, which no one in the West, outside the United States, can provide. Moreover—and this is a basic point—there is no evidence whatsoever that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> has any intention of making an ideological shift, of moving out of the “Socialist” camp, or of being ready to abandon his objectives in Latin America. His strong desire for greater independence relates to his relationships within, not outside, the camp. We believe that an arrangement like the one which the British may propose would be advantageous to Cuba and the USSR and distinctly disadvantageous to us. We consider that such a policy would be less effective than our present low-cost, low-risk policy in keeping <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> from moving toward his objective in the Hemisphere and in inducing a retraction of Soviet power and influence. In fact, the “relaxed” policy could well be destructive of any hopes of further progress toward our (and the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>) goals.</p>

The purpose of the two-day talks was (a) to assess the situation inside Cuba and (b) to take a look at the policy options now available to the West. By and large, the talks consisted of a U.S./U.K. dialogue, with the Canadians listening and chipping in only occasionally.</p>

                                            <hi rend="italic">Sugar</hi>—The crop this year will probably be about 5 million tons; it could be smaller if the cane does not get cut in time. In this regard, external activist pressures on Cuba seem to make some difference on cane-cutting; if there were a relaxation, there would be fewer soldiers and more experts available to cut cane.</p>
                                        <p>Cubaʼs sugar production will probably reach 6.0 to 7.5 million tons by 1970 (6.8 million in 1961), which is a lot of sugar but which is considerably short of the Cuban target of 10 million tons. Russian combines are now being used and will undoubtedly be used more and more in the future. Sugar expansion in Cuba does seem to have some limiting factors—e.g., the difficulty of putting too many resources into this one industry, in view of other requirements.</p>

Imports from the West will drop <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0747"/>considerably in 1965 as opposed to 1964 because of Cubaʼs foreign exchange problems.</item>

With respect to aid, Russian loans are probably not very hard and they probably donʼt expect to get repaid. As a general point, it is amazing how little the Russians get, in the form of Cuban good behavior, for the investment they are making.</item>

                                        <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous</hi>—A number of interesting miscellaneous points were made. First, the management problem is severe in Cuba. There is entirely too much transferring of personnel; also, the penalties for failure are excessive and lead to over-caution. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, Fidel is not always happy about sending trainees to Russia—e.g., learning to farm in a cold climate is not very applicable to farming in Cuba. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, next to sugar, cattle production is the second most important economic activity; arable crops donʼt seem to count for much. <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, in terms of growth, Cuba seems to be at the bottom of the pendulum. The economy may swing back and make up the ground it has lost since 1961, but it is probably going to take Cuba a number of years before there is any real economic growth.</item>

He made the point that the removal of the Old Guard from points of power might not only be a reflection of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs dissatisfaction with this group; it is also possible that the Old Guard is getting more and more disenchanted with Cuban progress and, in fact, is not unhappy to withdraw from the fray. In this regard, Watson speculated that the Old Guard may do much to feed Moscowʼs doubts about Russian involvement in Cuba.</item>

                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Cuban Relations with Latin America</hi>—At the outset, the British expressed strong reservations about the U.S. view regarding the threat of Cuban subversion in the Hemisphere. In the first place, there is not much subversion (e.g., “surely there is more <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> subversion against Cuba than there is Cuban subversion against Latin America”). In the second place, Cuban subversion is negotiable. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> is beginning to have doubts about it. He is not so sure there will be revolution in Latin America in the near future and, in any event, he is not so sure he will be the leader of it. These beliefs, in addition to the belief that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> may want to concentrate on his own island, lead the British to believe that he would reduce his subversion if he got something meaningful <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0748"/>in return. In a related regard, the British speculated that any recent increase in subversive activity has to do with the fact that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> may feel that his efforts at rapprochement with the West have been rebuffed.</p>
                                <p>The U.S. pointed out that, while it would be nonsense to attribute all Latin American tension to Cuba, it would be inaccurate to say that Cuba had no responsibility for a considerable part of it. Certainly, there was plenty of evidence around to indicate Cubaʼs subversive interests. <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, there was the recent meeting in Havana among Latin American communists to revitalize the subversive effort. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, there is in operation today a very energetic National Liberation Section in the Cuban Governmentʼs Directorate General of Intelligence. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, the public line has been getting harder. Cuba no longer talks so much about “exporting revolution by example.” In a recent speech, for instance,<placeName>Guevara</placeName> talked about “bullets instead of ballots.” <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, there are recent hard cases in point, too. In Colombia, for example, the leader of a recent carefully planned subversive incident had spent two months in Cuba just before coming home to lead the insurgency. <hi rend="italic">Fifth</hi>, the training of guerrillas goes on. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_VJH1">Vaughn</persName> noted that in Panama literally hundreds have received training over the past couple years and that this number of people can make quite an impact on a fragile society. His personal experience with a few of these trainees indicates that they are Chinese-oriented, fanatical, and violent.</p>
                                <p>By the end of the discussion, the British, while still implying that a deal might be made with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> on subversion, seemed to have a somewhat better appreciation of the Cuban threat in Latin America.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Soviet Intentions Towards Cuba</hi>—While there was a difference in emphasis between the U.S. and the British, by and large there was close agreement with the summary paragraphs attached at Tab 2.<note n="4" xml:id="d300fn4">Attached but not printed.</note> The British emphasized the point that the Russians are not very happy with the present burden and that they would certainly be prepared to accept closer Western/Cuban relations.</p>
                                <p>There was a good deal of discussion on the question of just how far the Soviets would be willing to disengage from Cuba. They would conceivably go pretty far—e.g., permit downfall of the Old Guard; agree to military neutralization of Cuba (although Cuba would have some contrary views on this). On the other hand, even the British did not think that the Soviets would willingly permit Cuba to leave the Socialist camp, although they did imply that this could conceivably come about over the long pull once the West had its foot firmly in the door.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Options for the West</hi>—By the end of the talks, the British view seemed to boil down to the following elements: <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, the U.S. policy <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0749"/>has been “brilliant” (Watson), and has provided us with a remarkable opportunity to loosen the Cuban/Soviet tie. This is an important opportunity since we do not want to make the Cuban/Soviet tie indissoluble. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, while it is clear that the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> should probably not ease their pressures, the non-<gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Free World countries should be encouraged to sound out the Cubans on what their terms might be. In this regard, one of the Western carrots might be an offer of increased contact with the non-<gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Free World (e.g., trade and cultural contacts), in exchange for good behavior on <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs part—i.e., less subversion.</p>
                                <p>The case for the present policy and for a harder policy was made by the U.S. and ran roughly as follows: We want to reduce subversion and induce a retraction of the USSR from the Hemisphere; in this regard, we are engaged in a policy designed to strengthen the internal resistance of L.A. governments, weaken Cuba, and demonstrate to the Soviets that they have made a mistake. Thus far, the policy has had moderate but measurable success. <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, economic prospects in Cuba are not bright; the regimeʼs failure to demonstrate progress has hurt the regime with its own people and has hurt Cuba as an example in Latin America. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, Cuba has been denied any subversive successes in Latin America. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, this hard policy has increased Cuban/Soviet tensions. <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, it should be emphasized that this is a policy which has called for very modest risks and costs on the part of the West.</p>
                                <p>Moreover, one could argue that a modest intensification of the present policy would improve results. (In this regard, for all practical purposes, the non-<gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> West has had no political restraints on their relations with Cuba.) Among other things, an intensification might increase Soviet/Cuban tensions and make <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> look like even more of a satellite to Latin Americans. This course, which does not significantly increase the chances of Cuban subversion, allows us to wait comfortably and safely for the breaks and for the chance of hitting the jackpot (eviction of the Soviets). On the other hand, relaxation may reduce the chances that we will ever hit the jackpot, may give Cuba political and economic respectability, and may demonstrate to Latin Americans that the Cuban path is worthwhile after all.</p>

                            <item>So far as the U.S. is concerned, the meetings were quite useful. In addition to providing us with an excuse to march up the Cuban hill again, the meetings gave us an opportunity to educate the British and Canadians to our side of the story and, hopefully, to persuade them that we are really not madmen when it comes to Cuba. The next step is to get together among ourselves and, taking into account the British views, give a good, hard, inter-departmental look at where we are headed and what we want to do about Cuba in the future. This process is in the works now and will be picking up steam over the next few weeks.</item>

                                        <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> turned to the Soviet Union in 1959 and 1960 more out of necessity than conviction, dictated by the internal and external programs he set for himself. In the process of reorienting Cuba toward the Soviet Bloc he came to accept Marxism-Leninism. His strong emotional commitment to radical change predisposed him in this direction. He is motivated, however, more by personal ambition than by ideological commitment. Having transformed Cuba into a Marxist-Leninist state and associated her with the Bloc, he finds himself more dependent upon Moscow than is compatible with his plans and temperament.</item>

                            <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> VIEWS ON THE DESIRABILITY OF REACTIVATING <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> PARAMILITARY EFFORT AGAINST CUBA</p>
                        <p rend="center">I. Background</p>
                        <p>In June 1963 President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> approved a covert policy and an integrated program of action toward Cuba. Three basic considerations underlay the program: first, the United States did not contemplate the use of military force against Cuba; second, the United States wished to exert maximum pressure by all means available to it (short of military intervention) to prevent the consolidation of the Communist regime; and third, dissident elements in the military and in other power centers of the regime could be encouraged to bring about the eventual <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0755"/>replacement of the regime and to eliminate the Soviet presence in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The program which was approved consisted of six interdependent, mutually reinforcing courses of action: (1) the covert collection of intelligence to meet both strategic and operational requirements; (2) propaganda actions to stimulate low-risk simple sabotage and other forms of active and passive resistance; (3) exploitation and stimulation of disaffection in the Cuban military and other power centers; (4) economic denial actions in support and extension of overt efforts; (5) general sabotage and harassment, designed to achieve economic and psychological impact and to be conducted by either external, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-controlled assets or by internal assets in being or to be developed, initial emphasis to be placed on external operations with a shift to internal assets as soon as feasible; and (6) support of “autonomous” anti-<persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> Cuban groups to supplement and assist in the execution of the foregoing courses of action.</p>
                        <p>Of these six components, the first four are still in operation. Although there was agreement when the entire program was approved that, if results were to be achieved it would be necessary to continue the program for a considerable period of time (18 months), even in the face of difficulties, the fact is that actions under Course 5 (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> controlled sabotage and harassment) were suspended in January 1964 after only five hit-and-run operations had been carried out in the period August-December 1963. In terms of purely Cuban policy, the raids probably had had a net positive effect. The decision to suspend was taken essentially on broader grounds, including concern about disturbing the emerging détente between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the Soviets (whose support <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> normally invokes against direct <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> pressures against him), the desire to avoid measures which might prevent or delay Soviet troop withdrawals from Cuba, the desire to have “clean hands” in moving towards <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> action on the Venezuelan arms cache case, and the belief that other less costly measures, particularly economic, would be effective. A tactical factor was the embarrassment caused us by the Cuban capture of a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> infiltration team in December 1963 and the subsequent revelations by members of the team. It is important to note that this incident occurred in connection with an infiltration and that this kind of operation continues to be approved.</p>
                        <p>Operations by “autonomous” groups were permitted to proceed, and the first effort occurred in April 1964. In late 1964-early 1965, however, these too were closed out because they were producing more problems and risks—including complications in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-USSR relations and in the Vietnamese situation—than results. An important special factor during most of the life of the autonomous operations was the concern that they would provoke Cuban action against <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> surveillance overflights. The immediate motive for abandonment of the autonomous approach <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0756"/>was the highly embarrassing attack on a Spanish merchant vessel in September 1964, which illustrated forcefully the lack of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> control over groups not directly responsive to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Thus, there are no paramilitary efforts being mounted against Cuba at present. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> proposal is, in effect, an attempt to seek a reversal of the early 1964 decision with respect to their own operations. There is no intention to resurrect the autonomous approach. The basis of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> proposal is the belief that the present state of the Cuban question counsels a resumption of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-controlled paramilitary activity.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II. Current Situation</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime is almost certainly more firmly entrenched now than at any time since its accession to power. Its control, however, is not absolute. The economy, although still operating at a relatively low level and hampered by disorganization and inefficiency, has been moving forward in the past two years. The prospect is that modest advances will continue through 1965, with the outlook highly uncertain beyond this year. Politically, the regime certainly has problems, but it appears capable of dealing with them, short of the disappearance of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. Security measures have become increasingly effective, but there are, from time to time, evidences of uneasiness and over-reaction to internal or external threats, real or imagined, on the part of the regime. The great bulk of the population is apathetic. Although the average Cuban is probably unhappy with his lot and skeptical of significant, early improvement of it, he is almost certainly becoming more and more resigned to the permanence of the regime. Internal active opposition to the government has grown increasingly weaker. Morale among anti-regime elements within and outside Cuba is low, and there is growing reluctance among these groups to take the risks involved in acts of resistance. This prudence is heightened by the absence of visible, effective external pressures.</p>
                        <p>The pressures, largely economic, which we have placed upon the regime have probably had moderate success in delaying—but not in preventing—the movement toward internal consolidation of the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> government. If maintained at their present level, they will probably become more and more difficult to maintain and less and less effective.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, these pressures have not induced the regime to abandon its subversive efforts in Latin America. The great bulk of the evidence shows that Cuba has been trying to make those efforts more effective at a time when our own subversive measures against it have been sharply reduced. There are, moreover, several indications of increased Soviet activity in fostering “national liberation movements” in Latin America. The Soviet endorsement of the harder line set forth by <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0757"/>the November 1964 meeting of Latin American Communist Parties in Havana has been translated, according to reliable reports, into concrete and substantial financial assistance to the Venezuelan FALN. It is not possible to say whether this apparent Soviet decision to become more heavily involved in Latin America arises from the need to meet Chinese Communist pressures, from an assessment that the general situation in the Hemisphere affords more opportunities than heretofore, or even from an intention to place heavier pressure on us in Latin America in response to our policies in Vietnam. No matter what its origin, the evidence of heightened Soviet activity in Latin America is clearly relevant to any consideration of the effects on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-USSR relations of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policies toward Cuba and toward subversion in Latin America.</p>
                        <p>The situation in Latin America from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> point of view remains fragile, and subversion, whether from Havana, Moscow or Peking acting independently or, in the case of the first two, together, remains a constant serious concern. It is certainly true that, in contrast to 1961, the image of Cuba in Latin America has been dimmed and that, moreover, this may have resulted in part from the comparatively low-key <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy toward Cuba in the past two years. Nevertheless, a Communist Cuba which will be able to show that it is progressing economically and is consolidated politically cannot help but be impressive in Latin America. When such a regime is able, at the same time, to continue to carry out acts of subversion with impunity, in part because it is under the protection of the USSR, the negative effects for the United States are magnified in Latin America. The weakening or even the disappearance of the Communist government in Cuba would certainly not solve <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> problems in Latin America, but its continuation and its gradual entrenchment seriously prejudice <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> objectives and programs.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> actions in the Dominican Republic have probably had mixed effects on Latin American views on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy toward Cuba. On the one hand, those elements in Latin America which have advocated a “hard” <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> line on Cuba and Communist subversion were probably encouraged by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intervention and hoped that it foreshadowed a “tougher” attitude in keeping with their opinion that the problem of subversion should be attacked at the source. They would probably welcome <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> moves against Cuba. On the other hand, most of the sectors which opposed or were made uneasy by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> action in the Dominican Republic as a retrograde step in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Latin American relations would probably tend to fear that a more aggressive <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> stance toward Cuba was part of a general administration policy of “cracking down” in Latin America. Therefore, their response probably would be unsympathetic. Although the Cuban regime has by no means been able to restore its image in Latin America as a result of the Dominican affair, it probably has made some gains in at least the short term in left sectors of the Hemisphere.</p>
                        <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0758"/>
                        <p>Within the United States, interest in the Cuban problem is at a very low ebb. The administration is not under significant domestic pressure to “do something”—beyond what it is now doing. In part, this attitude seems to be founded on the belief that matters are going reasonably well for us in Cuba. If this belief begins to wane, if events elsewhere in Latin America go against our interests and especially if such setbacks could be attributed in any way to Cuban activities, this acceptance of current administration policy could change, especially in 1966. An influential general factor here would be the results of our Vietnamese policy.</p>

                        <p>I am informed that you would like to have my views for presentation to the President on the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> proposal to reactivate its paramilitary efforts against Cuba. While I believe it would be advisable for the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to keep open, so far as may be practicable, the option of renewing such activities in the future should circumstances warrant, I am strongly opposed to resumption of such operations at this time. I believe that with the current situation in the Dominican Republic and the status of the conflict in Viet-Nam, not to mention other problems around the world, we should not initiate the actions proposed which could well precipitate another crisis. Moreover, the proposed program <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0763"/>could well affect Soviet policies in a manner adverse to our interests. I should be glad to reconsider the matter should changes in circumstances so warrant.</p>
                        <p>As of possible interest, I attach a study of this question prepared by the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs of the Department,<note n="2" xml:id="d306fn2">See <ref target="#d304">Document 304</ref>.</note> which constitutes a useful statement of the problem from the point of view of our interests in the Western Hemisphere, but, as will be noted above, on the basis of our world-wide interests, I do not reach the same conclusions.</p>

                        <p>The Department of State examined this proposal; the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs (<gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>) supported the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> reasoning.<note n="3" xml:id="d307fn3">See <ref target="#d304">Document 304</ref>.</note> They felt that of all possible methods, paramilitary activities have the best chance of creating within Cuba the political, economic, and psychological effects we seek. Reactivation of these operations would provide an unmistakable signal to all concerned of our continuing opposition to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. The stronger the regime becomes, the greater the difficulties and danger for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy in Latin America.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> concluded that we can 1) continue our present “limited” policy and probably lose ground; 2) we can increase pressure and perhaps arrest and eventually reverse the forward movement of the Cuban regime; 3) we can move forward toward an accommodation.… Of these options, the policy of increased pressure provides the best protection of our position in Latin America.</p>

                        <p>On September 28, 1965, Fidel <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> stated that Cubans desiring to go to the United States would be permitted to do so, and he declared that exiles wishing to come and pick up their relatives at the Port of Camarioca would be free to do so after October 10. There followed a chaotic rush of small boats from Florida to Camarioca.</p>
                        <p>On October 3, at a previously scheduled signing of an immigration bill at Liberty Island, New York, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> declared “to the people of Cuba that those who seek refuge here in America will find it.” Noting the dedication of Americans to the tradition of giving asylum to oppressed people, he directed the Departments of State, Justice, and Health, Education, and Welfare “to immediately make all the necessary arrangements to permit those in Cuba who seek freedom to make an orderly entry into the United States.” <persName>Johnson</persName> stated that priority would be given to immediate relatives and requested the assistance of the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross “in processing the movement of the refugees from Cuba to Miami.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>
                            </hi>, 1965, Book II, page 1039) In an October 6 memorandum to the President, <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> stated that “<persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> seems to have misread, deliberately or otherwise, your Statue of Liberty statement, interpreting it to mean that we wanted to conduct all negotiations through the Red Cross. We have pointed out to him through the Swiss that this is not the case. A note to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> setting forth our position on modalities for the movement of refugees is going to the Swiss Embassy in Havana today.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Files of <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, Daily Regional Staff Reports to President)</p>
                        <p>The first of the refugees with family members in the United States began arriving in Florida by small boat in October. By October 18 the number had exceeded 700. As <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> stated in an October 14 memorandum to the President, “we took special measures to persuade Cubans in southern Florida to wait until orderly arrangements could be worked out. We have been largely successful in obtaining their cooperation.” <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> noted that the previous night “the Cubans had replied to our note outlining procedures for handling the flow of refugees. They indicated a willingness to start operations right away. We had expressed a desire to keep the flow to about 3,000 per month, but they said they preferred a 12,000 rate. They said that men of military age (15–26 years) would not be allowed out, but agreed to our priority of immediate family members. They want to make up the lists of persons to depart, but they explicitly recognized our right to veto persons on the lists. They do not want the Red Cross to participate, noting that the Swiss can do what is necessary.” <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> concluded by stating <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0766"/>that the U.S. Government would “concentrate on getting agreement where agreement is possible, while insisting on orderly procedures for movement.” (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>Negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> through the Swiss Embassy in Havana resulted in the United States and Cuba exchanging notes on November 6 formalizing a Memorandum of Understanding covering procedures for the movement of refugees from Cuba to the United States. It called for the departure of between 3,000 and 4,000 Cubans per month in an airlift provided by the U.S. Government, departing from Varadero Airport, 85 miles east of Havana. The understanding contained no time limitation. The Cuban Government wanted two modifications inserted into the Memorandum of Understanding involving the exclusion of men of military age and also technicians and professional persons. The United States refused to incorporate the “two points” into the memorandum, and the Cuban Government finally agreed to refer to its prohibition on the departure of military age men, certain technicians, and political prisoners in supplemental notes to the general Memorandum of Understanding. Details of the U.S.-Cuba negotiations formalizing the Memorandum of Understanding are in the <persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Cuba, Vol. I, 4/64–1/66, including an October 28 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>, and the text of a note delivered by the Cuban Foreign Ministry to the Swiss Embassy in Havana on October 19.</p>
                        <p>The United States continued to insist that the Camarioca boat traffic had to be reduced, controlled, and eventually eliminated. On October 28 the Cuban Ministry of Interior announced that as of midnight that day, no more boats would be allowed to dock at Camarioca to pick up relatives. This action slowed the southward flow of boats, but some 300 small boats already anchored at Camarioca continued to move northward. Finally, on November 4, as agreement on the understanding became imminent, the Cuban Government announced that as of noon that day it would permit no further departure of Cuban citizens from Camarioca. (Department of State, Bureau of Public Affairs, Office of the Historian, Research Memorandum No. 1230, May 20, 1980)</p>
                        <p>On November 13 the U.S. Government began a sealift evacuation of the 2,000 stranded refugees at Camarioca by chartered vessels. The sealift was completed on November 24 when the last eligible Camarioca refugees were brought to the United States. The shift from sealift to airlift took place as scheduled on December 1. The airlift operated on the basis of two flights per day, 5 days a week, carrying an average of 4,000 persons each month from Varadero to Miami, Florida. In all, 9,268 refugees arrived from Cuba during 1965. Of these, 3,349 came in December via the airlift arranged by the United States and Cuban Governments. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1965</hi>, Book II, page 1040) As of December 1, 1968, the airlift <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0767"/>had brought 131,372 Cuban refugees to the United States. (Paper prepared by <persName corresp="#p_FJF1">John F. Fitzgerald</persName>, December 10, 1968; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, <gloss target="#t_ARACCA1">ARA/CCA</gloss> Files: Lot 73 D 191, Miscellaneous Correspondence, <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName>, Oct–Dec 1968) The airlift continued until April 1973, by which time a total of 260,737 refugees had entered the United States. (Department of State, Bureau of Public Affairs, Office of the Historian, Research Memorandum No. 1230, May 20, 1980)</p>
                        <p>The airlift provided a major new transportation link, since after the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 all direct commercial air transportation between the United States and Cuba had been suspended, although some people could arrange transportation through Mexico or Spain. “Several hundred thousand Cubans apparently registered their desire to leave Cuba when the airlift began or shortly thereafter.” (Paper prepared by <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName>, December 10, 1968; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, <gloss target="#t_ARACCA1">ARA/CCA</gloss> Files: Lot 73 D 191, Miscellaneous Correspondence, <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName>, Oct–Dec, 1968) The Cuban Government stopped accepting new registration for the airlift in May 1966 (see <ref target="#d309">Document 309</ref>). By December 1968, there were still thousands on this list awaiting departure.</p>

                        <p>In the past four days there have been two reported incidents of Cuban penetration of the Guantanamo Base perimeter. They are reminiscent of a rash (7) of such incidents last March.</p>

                        <p>A Marine sentry at about 7:00 p.m. observed an armed Cuban soldier on the Base side of the fence. The sentry reports that he challenged him and fired a warning shot which the intruder ignored. A second <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0768"/>shot wounded him. It is not clear whether the Cuban was on the Base side of the fence when this shot was fired. The Cuban soldier involved in the incident was probably the one which the Cuban Government alleges was killed by the Marines while at his post on the Cuban side of the fence.</p>

                        <p>At about midnight a Marine patrol sighted six armed Cuban soldiers in the salt flats area inside the Base perimeter. The Cubans reportedly fired four rounds at the Marines and fled over the fence. The Marines fired back with seven rounds. Our men were not hit. We have no report on the Cubans. But there is no evidence that they were hit.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>At present there is no indication that these incidents are in any way related to the Cuban suspension of refugee flights last Friday. The suspension was deliberate. But the reasons are not yet clear. Administrative delays in shifting from Category “A” refugees (immediate family members) to Category “B” (all others wishing to come) is not a sufficient explanation.</p>
                        <p>Since the airlift started last December 1, almost 22,000 Cuban refugees in the “A” Category have arrived. The Cuban Government claims that there are no more persons in this particular group who wish to come. We know otherwise—HEW has close to 50,000 Category “A” applications.</p>
                        <p>We told the Cubans last week that we are prepared to start with Category “B” refugees, so that the record is clear that any delay—or suspension—is not our doing.</p>
                        <p>There are several as yet inconclusive indicators that the Cubans would like to close down the airlift if they could find a means to shift the onus on us. State is alive to this and will not get mouse-trapped.</p>

                                    <item>Increase emphasis on the collection of intelligence and counterintelligence through operations in third countries. This is necessary because of the quantitative and qualitative improvement in the Cuban security services which has resulted in increasing difficulty in creating and maintaining in-place assets in Cuba. The decline in the productivity of agents recruited by means of infiltration operations exemplifies this problem.</item>

                                    <item>Because of the decreasing effectiveness of intelligence infiltration operations it is planned to limit these to those essential to exfiltrate agents who are in difficulties in Cuba, to provide support to inside assets, and to infiltrate teams for intelligence purposes only on limited occasions in order to gain access to high priority targets.</item>
                                    <label>c.</label>
                                    <item>To revise the total output of written and radio propaganda directed at Cuba, retaining those portions of the current program which are currently effective, and eliminating those portions which have become outdated because of the erosion of time and changes in the situation. The revision of the program will involve an overall quantitative reduction, but is not expected to affect the impact within Cuba appreciably. The proposal envisages elimination or reduction of support to certain specialized exile groups, such as jurists, students, and teachers. Also under active consideration is the possibility of substituting use of commercial radio stations located in the U.S. for the present radio broadcast facility maintained [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>].</item>

Gordon noted that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> intended to cut down its 24-hour-a-day propaganda broadcasts to Cuba to 4–6 hours of comparatively high-quality material. Gordon also noted that the Agency intended to maintain “on an active basis six highly trained and expert infiltration teams (out of a one-time maximum of 25) on which it can rely for intelligence collection purposes.” (Ibid.)</note>

                            <item>The level of the economy in 1966 was only slightly above that reached in 1958, the last prerevolutionary year; per capita private consumption was down nearly 25 percent, though favored groups in the population were better off. Economic gains in 1967 and 1968 will probably be minor, with little or no improvement in living conditions.</item>

                            <item>Fidel will almost certainly persist in providing encouragement and training support to “anti-imperialist” and insurgent movements abroad, and in extending material aid to a few of them. Poor prospects for success in Latin America help to account for his increased support to revolutionary elements in Africa, where there are more opportunities and fewer risks.</item>
                            <label>D.</label>
                            <item>Differences about Communist revolutionary tactics and the amount of aid required by Cuba will continue to produce frictions in the Cuban-Soviet relationship. But Cuba remains important to the Soviets; they have little practical choice except to keep backing Fidel.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> has continued the process of institutionalizing his revolution and has talked of sharing more responsibility with his inner circle of colleagues.

                            <item>In the unlikely event of Fidelʼs death or incapacitation during the next two years, a collegium headed by his brother Raúl and President Dorticós would probably take control. We doubt that this arrangement could long endure; at some point it would probably give way to a power struggle of unpredictable outcome. However, we know of no basis for supposing that a resulting new government would fundamentally change the domestic political and economic system. The effect on Cubaʼs foreign affairs is beyond useful speculation.</item>

<quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“We do not believe that the Soviets will again try to turn Cuba into a strategic base of their own, as in 1962. We think it highly unlikely that the USSR will attempt to reintroduce strategic missiles into Cuba.<note n="2" xml:id="d312fn2">In an April 18 memorandum to the Director of Central Intelligence, Thomas H. Young, Jr., Acting Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-DIA Team, reported that “we have received no intelligence which changes our conclusions that there are no strategic weapons or nuclear warheads in Cuba.” (OCI No. 1092/67; ibid., <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> File, Vol. II, 2/66–7/67)</note> We recognize that the Soviets have the technical capability clandestinely to reintroduce the components of a strategic weapon system. But the build-up of strategic forces in the USSR in recent years would make the installation of strategic weapons in Cuba of less significance to the Soviet strategic posture than in 1962. In any event, we believe that the risk of another grave confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would be unacceptable to the Soviets.”</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>You should know that Paul Bethel is a propagandist who for the past five years has traded on his brief experience in our Embassy in Havana to make a living out of the Cuban issue. What he told the Subcommittee today is the same tale which he has repeatedly published in his newsletter and tells everybody who is willing to listen to him. The sources for his charges are the same Cuban refugees who passed through our intelligence screening process in Miami. What they tell our interviewers is critically examined by experts. Bethel accepts the stories without critical evaluation.</p>
                        <p>I am having State do an assessment of other charges made in his testimony. You will see from this how wild and irresponsible Bethel can be.<note n="3" xml:id="d312fn3">A handwritten postscript by <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> on the memorandum reads: “P.S.

                        <p>At Punta del Este Valdez<note n="2" xml:id="d313fn2">Gabriel Valdez Subercaseaux, Chilean Foreign Minister.</note> spoke to me about Cuba and seemed to think that there are now some differences of view in Havana which might be open to probing. I told him what I had many months ago told Carrillo Flores of Mexico. The attitude of the United States remains that indicated by President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName>, namely, that Cuba could find its way back to the Hemisphere if it (a) stopped its interference in the affairs of other American states by agents, arms and propaganda, and (b) severed its military association with the Soviet Union. I said that the internal organization of Cuba is not the crucial obstacle but that these two primary external forces were fundamental. As you will recall, these have been the two key points all along. I added to Valdez that we have seen no real evidence that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> is prepared to change his attitude on either point. Indeed, he seems to be differing with Moscow on the question of interference in other countries. Nonetheless, I told Valdez I saw no objection to any most secret probes which he might wish to undertake and that if he got anything of interest coming back we would be glad to know about it. I further said that we would set up this special channel between you and me in order to assure maximum secrecy and that he could be entirely frank in passing on to you, and to you alone, anything that develops.<note n="3" xml:id="d313fn3">Dungan reported to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, in telegram 283 from Santiago, July 26, that Valdez had said the previous day that “there had been no developments significant enough to pass on to you.” Valdez stated that the Cubans had been interested in knowing whether the Chilean probe was being made with the knowledge of the U.S. Government and that they were told that “this strictly Chilean initiative.” Dungan concluded the telegram by stating that it was his impression “that matter is not being pushed aggressively.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, POL CHILE–<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>)</note>

                        </list>
                        <p>A review of our Cuba policy seems very much needed.</p>
                        <p>Our present policy of economic denial and political isolation through <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> action has contributed to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs difficulties, but has not shaken his grip on power. It may indeed be running into considerable difficulty. In any event, after six years it is only prudent to ask whether this policy will be the best means of advancing our national interests under the conditions which may prevail in the future.</p>
                        <p>A policy review might well conclude that, all things considered, no fundamental change is required. Various alternative strategies could, however, usefully be explored. For example, the manner and consequences of applying considerably increased pressure on the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime, and the opportunities and risks involved in seeking some accommodation could both be studied.</p>
                        <p>Without a thorough evaluation, however, we do not have the basis for recommending any of these courses of action on Cuba. The NPP (National Policy Papers) would seem to offer the best framework for such a study: they are well established, interagency, comprehensive, and authoritative.</p>
                        <p>We would, of course, keep strict security on the fact of this review.</p>

                        <p>In a May 23, 1967, memorandum for the record Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency J. S. Earman indicated that beginning April 24 he transmitted in installments a 133-page report to Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard Helms</persName> on plots to assassinate Fidel <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. A copy of the report is in the National Archives and Records Administration, RG 233, JFK Assassination Collection, Microfilm File 104–10184–10001, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Files, Job 80–T01357A, Box JFK64, Folder R48–ZZ. After reading a March 7, 1967, column by Drew Pearson that alleged the United States attempted to assassinate <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> directed <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> to conduct an investigation. (<hi rend="italic">Interim Report of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities</hi>, Report No. 94–465, “Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders,” November 20, 1975, page 179) The result was the Inspector Generalʼs Report of April 24, 1967, which clearly indicated that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was in contact with and cooperated with Major Rolando Cubela of the Cuban military in plans to assassinate Fidel <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. The operation was known as Project AMLASH. After receiving the report, <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> orally briefed the President about its contents. According to his testimony before the Select Committee, when asked by the Committee if he had told the President “that efforts to assassinate Fidel <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> had continued into <persName>Johnson</persName>ʼs Presidency, <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> replied, ‘I just canʼt answer that, I just donʼt know. I canʼt recall having done so.’” (“Alleged Assassination Plots,” page 179) When asked whether President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had been informed of or had authorized continuing efforts to assassinate <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> replied: “The Special Group would have continued to consider these matters, and I would have assumed that whoever was chairing the Special Group would have in turn reported to the President, which was the usual practice.” (Ibid., page 180)</p>
                        <p>The records of the Special Group for the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration do not record any consideration, authorization, or involvement by the United States in any plot to assassinate <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> during the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration, even though the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had a relationship with Cubela. Special Group/303 Committee Records of June–August 1964 indicate only that, in regard to rumors of Cuban émigré assassination plots against <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and selected Cuban leaders, <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BM1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> were to inform Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> to use U.S. law enforcement agencies to prevent such plans. (Minutes of Special Group Meetings, June 18, 1964, and July 30, 1964; Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INRIL1">INR/IL</gloss> Historical Files, 5412 Special Group/303 Committee Records) The June 18, 1964, Minutes of a 303 Committee meeting read: “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> was somewhat skeptical of the reported plots and stated that he would like <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0777"/>to go into the matter further. Others, including Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName>, felt that the United States was being put on notice and should do everything in its power to ascertain promptly the veracity of the reports and then undertake prevention. It was decided that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> would call the matter to the Attorney Generalʼs attention as a matter of law enforcement.” (Ibid., Minutes of the June 18, 1964, meeting) Following an FBI investigation that dismissed the reported exile assassination plans, <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> sent <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> an August 19 memorandum reviewing the investigation and agreeing with the FBI analysis. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Cuba, Exile Activities, Vol. I, 11/63–7/65)</p>
                        <p>In the minutes of the Special Group/303 Committee meeting on January 7, 1965, a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> January 6 paper acknowledges Rolando Cubela only as “a representative of an internal military dissident group, which is plotting to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>.” The minutes indicate the Committee members asked, “What sort of man is Cubela?” See <ref target="#d295">Document 295</ref> and footnotes 3 and 4 thereto.</p>
                        <p>The Select Committee concluded: “the records of the Special Group do not show any consideration of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs assassination or of the AMLASH plot during the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration (or earlier) and there was no other evidence that <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> or anyone above the Agency was informed of or specifically authorized the AMLASH plots.” (“Alleged Assassination Plots,” page 180)</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Inspector Generalʼs Report of April 24, 1967, provides considerable information about Project AMLASH during the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration. The Report indicates that a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officer was passing an assassination weapon, a ballpoint pen rigged with a hypodermic needle for Black Leaf 40 poison, to Rolando Cubela, AMLASH–1, at the very hour that President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> was shot. (Inspector Generalʼs Report, pages 93–95)</p>
                        <p>The Inspector Generalʼs report provides background on Rolando Cubela Secades, the second-ranking leader of the Directorio Revolucionario (<gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss>) 13 de Marzo, an elite group of leftist students founded in 1956 to organize violence to overthrow the Batista regime. (Ibid., pages 78–79) Although close to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, Cubela became disenchanted with him. When the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> first contacted him in March of 1961 in Mexico City, Cubela was non-committal, but he soon began to insist that the essential first step in overthrowing the Cuban regime was the elimination of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> himself, which Cubela stated he was prepared to accomplish. (Ibid., pages 79–90)</p>
                        <p>After the aborted ballpoint poison pen incident, Cubela attempted to obtain a silencer for a Belgian FAL submachine gun, but the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was unable to produce one in time to be included in an arms cache drop. (Ibid., page 97) On December 6–7, 1964, in Paris, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> informed Cubela that the United States could no longer be involved in <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0778"/>the attempted assassination of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and that he would have to get help elsewhere in this respect. (“Alleged Assassination Plots,” page 89; Inspector Generalʼs Report, page 100) Instead, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> put Cuban exile leader Manuel <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> and Cubela together in such a way that neither knew that the contact had been engineered by the Agency. “The thought was that <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> needed a man inside and Cubela wanted a silenced weapon, which <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was unwilling to furnish to him directly. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> did not intend to furnish an assassination weapon for <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> to give to Cubela, and did not do so.” (Inspector Generalʼs Report, pages 100–101) <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> and Cubela met in Madrid on December 27 and December 30, 1964, where <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> agreed to provide a silencer to Cubela. (Ibid., pages 101–102) In Madrid on February 10–12, 1965, Cubela met <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Artime</persName> and reportedly received a Belgian FAL rifle with silencer and a pistol with silencer. Also during February 1965, Cubela requested financial assistance from several <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officers for emergency travel expenses, and was given a total of $8,200. (Ibid., page 106)</p>
                        <p>According to the Inspector Generalʼs Report, “On June 25, 1965, headquarters sent a cable to the stations concerned directing termination of contact with members of the Cubela group. It read in part: ‘convincing proof that entire AMLASH group insecure and that future contact with key members of group constitutes menace to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> operations against Cuba as well as to security of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Staff personnel in Western Europe. Under circumstances headquarters desires that contact work with key members of the group be eliminated as rapidly as possible, and that assets who may be in contact with individual members of the group or peripherally involved in AMLASH conspiracy be warned of danger implicit in these associations and directed to eliminate contacts ASAP.’” (Ibid., page 106) The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> decided to terminate all contacts with the Cubela group, after it became apparent “that the circle of Cubans who knew of Cubelaʼs plans and of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>ʼs association with them was ever-widening.” (Ibid., pages 104–105) In March 1966, Cubela was arrested by Cuban security police, confessed his guilt, and, after <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs written request to the prosecutor that the death penalty not be imposed, was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. (Ibid., pages 107–111)</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>As I am certain you know, one of the continuing concerns of this Bureau has been with the implementation of the Departmentʼs controls on the travel of U.S. citizens to Cuba. The Under Secretary spoke to me a short time ago on the general subject of travel controls.<note n="2" xml:id="d316fn2">No record of this conversation has been found.</note> He said that although he agreed with the position we had taken in several recent instances, such as the <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName> case, he thought that possibly <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>ʼs position on travel to Cuba was unnecessarily severe.</p>
                        <p>With this in mind, I thought it might be appropriate to outline to you our problems and views on this subject.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Our Current Practice on Cuban Travel:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Restrictions exist on the travel of American citizens to North Viet-Nam, North Korea and Communist China, as well as to Cuba. Under the current implementing rules (Tab A),<note n="3" xml:id="d316fn3">Attached but not printed, Tab A, the Department of Stateʼs July 11, 1966, Press Release No. 163, restated the Departmentʼs guidelines relating to travel ban exceptions, added a new category of applicants, and restated the main criteria that such travel “be in the national interest of the United States.”</note> exceptions to these restrictions relate to such categories as professional journalists, medical and public health specialists, and graduate scholars needing to do research in Cuba connected with their specialties. Other cases—including those involving humanitarian factors—are considered on a discretionary basis.</p>
                        <p>Journalists and scholars, of course, constitute the bulk of applications for waivers to our travel restrictions. As I understand it, SCAʼs position is that journalists, for example, constitute a <hi rend="italic">mandatory</hi> exception, but it is supposed to be necessary for applicants to show (1) that they are established journalists who earn the greater part of their living through this profession and (2) that they are going to Cuba only <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0780"/>for reporting purposes. In determining the application of these two factors to each case, SCA normally requests the views of our Coordinator of Cuban Affairs (<gloss target="#t_ARACCA1">ARA/CCA</gloss>). Until recently, if that office interposed strong objections to an application, SCA either accepted these objections or deferred a final decision on the validation of the applicantʼs passport until CCA had had an opportunity to present its views in detail.</p>
                        <p>The celebration of Cubaʼs National Day on July 26 this year and the <gloss target="#t_LASO1">LASO</gloss> (Latin American Solidarity Organization) conference which began on July 31 resulted in a flood of applications for journalist travel to Cuba. Our present concern over the handling of those applications arose when it became clear that <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>ʼs role, as outlined above, was being seriously eroded to the point where, in a number of the most doubtful cases, passports were validated despite the fact that CCA had raised strong objections, in some cases without informing CCA of the action taken. I have attached (Tab B)<note n="4" xml:id="d316fn4">Attached but not printed.</note> a summary of several case examples.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>ʼs View on Cuban Travel:</p>
                        <p>Our concern with the present way in which these applications are being handled does not stem from any innate desire on the part of this Bureau to be simply “hard-nosed”. As a general rule, I personally believe that “the truth will out” and that any increase in the flow of information or opinions eventually will work to our advantage. However, I hardly need point out that the way in which we carry out the various aspects of our policy toward Cuba directly affects our relations with other Latin American countries. The application of our own restrictions on travel to Cuba is no exception to this rule.</p>
                        <p>It is part of our basic policy, and that of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, to isolate Cuba, not only to cut down the movement of subversives, but also for political, economic and psychological reasons. This policy was reiterated strongly by the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> Foreign Ministers at their meeting in Washington September 22–24, 1967. In connection with the recent <gloss target="#t_LASO1">LASO</gloss> conferences, we made strenuous efforts to encourage Latin American governments to inhibit travel to that meeting. As a result, even Mexico, which has never broken relations with Cuba, cooperated with us with surprising effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>However, because of our leadership in the area of Hemispheric policy toward Cuba, the Latin Americans continually search for, and are quick to point out, any inconsistency, real or imagined, in our words and deeds. We are constantly enjoined by them to “practice what we preach”. The presence of so many U.S. enthusiasts for the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0781"/>who have been <hi rend="italic">authorized</hi> by the Department to travel to Cuba inevitably raises questions in the minds of other Latin American governments.</p>
                        <p>All of this does not, of course, argue for no travel to Cuba. But it does I hope point up the fact that this Bureau has a central responsibility in determining the <hi rend="italic">scope</hi> of our waiver policy; that our interest stems not simply from the fact that Cuba is within the geographic zone of this Bureau but more importantly, that U.S. actions on the matter of Cuban travel affect <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>ʼs responsibilities elsewhere in Latin America.</p>
                        <p>I do not intend that we in <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> become simply “no sayers”. But at the same time we must put forward our views when the situation warrants and, to do this, we need to be certain that full consideration will be given to them. I regret to say that as the system of considering applications for waivers now operates, we do not believe our views are being given the consideration due them.</p>
                        <p>I have seen enough of human institutions to know that a policy is sometimes changed without admitting it, by lowering the intensity of its administration. On the whole I think this is a poor way to make foreign policy. If a change in our policy on travel to Cuba is desired, then the Department ought to face up to that possibility, instead of fudging on operations under existing policy.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Cuba has announced that early next year it will host a conference of “artists, scholars and writers” and that a conference of journalists is scheduled for July 1968. I can assure you now that we intend to cooperate as fully as possible with all interested offices to make certain that within existing <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policies toward Cuba, our travel regulations are applied in such a way as to serve our own best interests.

                        <p>Last Friday I had a most interesting talk with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>ʼs new man in Cuba. He is Dave Phillips—one of their more sophisticated operators who performed so well in the <gloss target="#t_DR1">DR</gloss> following the 1965 revolt.</p>
                        <p>Dave is revamping the Cuban operation. The apparatus mounted following the Bay of Pigs is obsolete. It was aimed at stimulating <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs overthrow from the outside with propaganda, infiltrators, supplies, etc. For this purpose they had a large and not well-camouflaged establishment in Miami. The Miami operation is being phased out. The sizeable sea-borne infiltration-exfiltration capability is being dismantled and a small, more efficient one established for stand-by use. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] is being discontinued.<note n="2" xml:id="d317fn2">In a December 6 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, Trueheart noted that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was “set to phase out [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] the end of the fiscal year and to initiate, in its stead, broadcasts directed to Cuba from various privately owned stations” in the Caribbean area, including Costa Rica and Venezuela. Trueheart added that the “programs would be more temperate than those broadcast from [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]” but that they would “play up matters embarrassing to the Cuban regime to an extent that would be difficult for VOA.” Trueheart also noted that he had notified the 303 Committee Secretariat that the Department of State approved the termination of the infiltration/exfiltration operations against Cuba. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INRIL1">INR/IL</gloss> Historical Files, 5412 Special Group/303 Committee Records) In a December 12 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName>, Trueheart noted that the minutes of the December 8 303 Committee meeting stated that “the decision to discontinue these operations and maintain a skeleton force was approved.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The new emphasis is on developing contacts within <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs inner circle. We need to know more about who his main advisers are and what they are thinking. If there is to be a change in Cuba, it is more likely to come from defections in this group. If <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> were to start looking for accommodation, one of them would be the first to know and probably the channel for feelers.</p>
                        <p>Dave agrees that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> finds himself increasingly hemmed in. The loss of “Che” and the insurgency effort in Bolivia on the heels of the big <gloss target="#t_LASO1">LASO</gloss> splash has been a serious blow. The outlook for the sugar <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0783"/>crop this year is not good: only 5–5.5 million tons. Cuba is committed to deliver 5 million to the USSR alone. Relations with the Soviets are probably the testiest since the missile crisis, as reflected by Cubaʼs actions during the 50th anniversary ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>All this makes it most important that we:

                        <p>Attached is a memorandum given to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> by the Spanish Ambassador on December 21<note n="2" xml:id="d318fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> reporting on a conversation between a special Spanish emissary and Fidel <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Cuban relations.</p>
                        <p>In a conversation with the Spanish Foreign Minister last month, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked if Spanish diplomats in Havana were in contact with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>. The Secretary noted that it would perhaps be beneficial if they were to remind <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> that there are only two issues in our relations with Cuba which we regard as non-negotiable: (1) Cuban intervention and guerrilla activities in other Latin American countries and (2) the <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0784"/>presence of Soviet arms on Cuban soil. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, on the other hand, had no interest in interfering in Cubaʼs internal political situation.</p>
                        <p>It was not the Secretaryʼs intention that the Spanish send a special emissary to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, but in their eagerness to be a bridge, they did. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> received him promptly and listened intently. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> was puzzled by the overture (“Why would the Americans think of this now?”, he asked) but did not reject it. He said he wanted to analyze carefully the motives and timing of the message before responding. Predictably, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> used the opportunity to recite all his grievances against the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> promised to maintain utmost discretion about the approach and to use the same channel for any response he may decide to make.</p>
                        <p>The Spaniards have taken what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> intended to be a low-key reminder to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> of our position and, for self-serving reasons, escalated it to a special message delivered by a special envoy. As long as there are no leaks, this may prove to be an interesting and useful exercise. If it gets out that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has taken the initiative in putting out accommodation feelers to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, it may prove embarrassing to us in Latin America and on the domestic political front. We have asked State to handle the matter on a most restrictive basis.</p>

                        <p>The only committee pertinent to <gloss target="#t_ARACCA1">ARA/CCA</gloss> is the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on Cuba, of which I am chairman. <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0785"/>This was established pursuant to National Security Action Memorandum No. 213 (Secret) of January 8, 1963, of which a copy is attached.<note n="3" xml:id="d319fn3">Attached but not printed.</note> NSAM 213 specified that this committee should be chaired by the Departmentʼs Coordinator of Cuban Affairs whose position was also created pursuant to NSAM 213. The other agencies on the Committee are the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency, currently represented by Deputy Assistant Secretary William Lang (ISA) and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWV1">William Broe</persName>. Other agencies may be associated with the Committeeʼs work as necessary in particular cases.</p>
                        <p>It is recommended that the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on Cuba now be eliminated<note n="4" xml:id="d319fn4">In a May 28 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RBH1">Read</persName> forwarded the Departmentʼs recommendation “that the portions of NSAM No. 213 that refer to an ‘Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee for Cuban Affairsʼ be revoked.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,<gloss target="#t_ARACCA1">ARA/CCA</gloss> Files: Lot 73 D 191, POL Misc. Working Papers, 1966–1968)</note> inasmuch as the establishment in the intervening period of the SIG/<gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> mechanism provides an instrument for interdepartmental coordination of matters relating to Cuba along with all other areas. Because of the SIG/<gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>, the Committee has not met since December 1966. Moreover, many of the factors which impelled the NSC to establish a special coordinating committee on Cuba in January 1963 have changed in focus in the last few years. Accordingly, it is recommended that steps be taken to withdraw that portion of NSAM 213 concerned with the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on Cuba.<note n="5" xml:id="d319fn5">In a June 12, 1969, memorandum to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> noted that this recommendation had had the advance concurrence of <persName corresp="#p_SRM1">Sayre</persName>, William Lang (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/ISA), and <persName corresp="#p_BWV1">Broe</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> then stated that “I later learned that no action was taken on this recommendation at the White House, apparently because Bill <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName>, while agreeing with the reasoning behind the recommendation, believed that it was still desirable to keep the Committee in being as a useful instrumentality for the Coordinator in case a crisis situation arose.” (Ibid., 1969)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such action, however, should not apply to the position, functions or authority of the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs who, under NSAM 213 was given day-to-day coordinating responsibility for Cuban policy. NSAM 213 provided that the Coordinator “will be responsible to the Secretary of State for State Department business, and under his guidance to the President and the Executive Committee for interdepartmental coordination”. The need for this day-to-day coordination continues to exist.</p>

This is necessary so that (a) we do not give the impression to Cuba and to the world that we have finally accepted the permanence of the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime in an unchanged form, and (b) that we do not over-emphasize the “carrot” aspect in the carrot and stick approach.

                            <item>There is, however, one important new factor. Since the draft was first produced, internal conditions in Cuba have deteriorated strikingly. This trend has intensified even since the last draft was considered. This situation has been covered in other documents, including the first draft of the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> paper on Cuba<note n="3" xml:id="d320fn3">Attached but not printed, the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> Paper on Cuba, May 10, described a progressive decline in Cuba, including a shortage of consumer goods, a very poor sugar crop, a decline in Cuban productivity and foreign exchange earnings, public protest demonstrations, and anti-<persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> wall writings. Also see <ref target="#d321">Document 321</ref>.</note> which is now being submitted. The point at hand here, however, is that the current deterioration in Cuba gives more hope than we have had for a long time that elements in the Cuban power elite may themselves conceivably be impelled within the near or at least foreseeable future to consider whether some drastic change does not have to be made in Cubaʼs posture toward the world (and even in the internal aspects) if Cuba is to survive. I therefore think that now and for some months to come we should be even more cautious in anything we do so as not to convey a seeming signal<note n="4" xml:id="d320fn4">In a February 16 memorandum to Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Katzenbach</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName> had proposed an easing of the administrative criteria with respect to licenses for export of pharmaceuticals to Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Katzenbach</persName> approved this recommendation on February 23. However, in an April 30 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName> recommended that this modification be deferred because “Intelligence and other reports indicate a striking deterioration in economic, psychological and other conditions in Cuba.” (Both in National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, <gloss target="#t_ARACCA1">ARA/CCA</gloss> Files: Lot 73 D 245, The Secretary, 1968)</note> that we have <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0787"/>finally accepted the permanence of the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime just at a time when others, who have disagreed with our attitude in the past, may be acquiring real doubts as to the viability of the regime. It is a time for alert watchfulness and for sending of signals which encourage power elite elements to do something about <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> or some of his policies in the hope that they could reach accommodation with us, rather than a time to seem conciliatory toward the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime as such.</item>

                        <head>322. Editorial Note</head>
                        <p>Henry Owen, Chairman of the Policy Planning Council, obtained <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>ʼs approval in May 1967, to review U.S. policy toward Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed that a National Policy Paper (NPP) offered the best framework for such a study (see <ref target="#d314">Document 314</ref>). The study did not get started until September 1967. During the spring of 1968, the ideas of the second draft of the NPP were still being debated within the Department of State (see <ref target="#d320">Document 320</ref>).</p>
                        <p>The Policy Planning Councilʼs final draft National Policy Paper on Cuba, dated July 15, 1968, described the present U.S. policy as “passive containment,” consisting of three conceptual elements—1) protecting other countries from Cuban subversion; 2) applying “diplomatic isolation and economic denial policies” aimed at both hindering <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs capacity to export subversion and at maximizing his internal problems and vulnerabilities; and 3) “hoping and waiting for ‘breaks’” that might improve the situation. It described the present policy as the easiest one to follow at the time, but stated that the “capacity of the U.S. to isolate Cuba, exert pressure on <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and exploit vulnerabilities is declining.” “The ability of ‘passive containment’ to meet U.S. objectives may therefore with time have to depend increasingly upon the pure containment aspect, i.e., simply countering <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs probes at target sites, rather than on measures having direct impact on Cuba itself.”</p>
                        <p>The paper stated that the only apparent hope “that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and/or the Cuban power structure” would change their policy rested “on their becoming convinced that it is unproductive.” “Present U.S. policy, however, does not promise to be the most effective way to achieve this kind of long-term improvement.” It predicted that the effectiveness of economic denials would decline over the next few years and that the political cost of U.S. policy would grow greatly. “Present policy in sum is a negative and reactive one which offers limited promise of effecting desirable change.”</p>
                        <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0789"/>
                        <p>The paper advocated replacing “passive containment” with “positive containment,” which it described as “a series of initiatives, parallel steps, concrete actions and understandings concerning limited things, all acted on their own merits at the time, the cumulative effect of which over time would be de facto changes.” It described “positive containment” as a strategy containing the elements of containment (keeping <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> from successfully subverting other countries), pressure (continued application of isolation/denial measures), psychological context (a change in the basic U.S. policy attitude of implacable hostility and threatening intentions), and “a variety of alternative probes to improve the situation.”</p>
                        <p>It would be important in the psychological context “largely to ignore <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> in public stances and proclamations” and to project “patience and friendliness toward the Cuban people.” In this respect, the paper advocated “encouraging more legitimate and responsible scholarship.”</p>
                        <p>The paper illustrated how a scenario of incremental “parallel” steps might unfold, without actually recommending the specific quids and pros. As an example, the paper notes that a <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> quid of continued repatriation of American citizens could be matched by a U.S. pro of granting licenses for commercial shipment of pharmaceuticals “on a more lenient basis.”</p>
                        <p>The paper concluded with a long series of courses of actions and contingencies. It restated basic U.S. Latin American policy ideas such as support for the Alliance for Progress, <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> regional cooperation, and intelligence surveillance, but also advocated steps to create a new atmosphere and new initiatives. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, S/P Files: Lot 72 D 139, Cuba, 1967–68)</p>
                        <p>This change in policy, however, was never approved, much less implemented. Instead, the present policy continued. In an August 28 memorandum to <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> Staff Director William D. Broderick, Director of the Office of Inter-American Political Affairs John W. Ford noted that his office agreed “with CCA that this is not the most propitious moment to embark on such a program, as Cubaʼs present economic straits and the signs of growing discontent would indicate that the pinch of isolation is having a real effect and that we should therefore maintain the full pressure of the isolation policy.” He noted, furthermore, “that any U.S. actions or concessions must fit within the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> criteria to which we are a party and must avoid if possible the impression of unilateral U.S. policy making. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_ARACCA1">ARA/CCA</gloss> Files: Lot 71 D 201, POL 3.4 <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>) In an October 29 briefing paper <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> wrote that this draft national policy paper “was never formally processed for approval because it was decided that it should be considered by the new administration.” (Ibid., Lot 73 D 191, Misc. Correspondence, <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName>, Oct–Dec 1968)</p>

                        <p>In view of your familiarity with the Cuban situation as a result of chairing the NPP Working Group on Cuba, I assume it is unnecessary for me to give you a political, economic and security assessment.</p>
                        <p>The following are the major current problems and issues relating to Cuba:</p>

                        <p>You are, of course, familiar with policy issues for the reason given above and I will therefore not discuss these here.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>So far we have gotten back with reasonable promptness all of the U.S. planes, crews and passengers hijacked to Cuba (including the Cuban-born pilot, Prellezo, who was detained for a week or two before release), but the problem continues to be one of grave concern<note n="3" xml:id="d323fn3">In a February 27, 1969, briefing paper <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> noted that from 1961 through 1968, 34 U.S. planes were hijacked to Cuba, including 17 in 1968. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, <gloss target="#t_ARACCA1">ARA/CCA</gloss> Files: Lot 73 D 191, Misc. Correspondence, <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName>, Jan–March 1969)</note> in aviation, Governmental, Congressional and press circles, particularly because of the danger that one of these days an accident may cause loss of lives. Measures to prevent hijackers from boarding planes or, once they are aboard, to thwart diversion of a plane to Cuba, are not promising and emphasis is therefore placed on the deterrence which might result from some arrangement for the return of hijackers to the U.S. for prosecution. The problem here is that since Cuba has not been suffering from Hijacking of its planes, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> has no incentive to enter into an arrangement primarily of benefit to us. We have no evidence <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0791"/>so far that the GOC is back of these hijackings and they may be embarrassed by the whole situation, but we feel that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> would meet any request for return of hijackers with a demand for return to Cuba of all persons who escaped from the island by small boat or otherwise. At present we are exploring possibilities for solution through the Mexican Government and through international civil aviation organizations like ICAO and IATA. We have also asked the Swiss to ascertain Cuban willingness to use the refugee airlift plane for a return to Cuba of Cuban exiles who wish to go back permanently<note n="4" xml:id="d323fn4">In his February 27 briefing paper, <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> stated that “No response was received in the ensuing months” to this initiative.

                        </p>
                        <p>In recent months anonymous Cuban exiles, usually using the signature “Cuban Power”, have been engaging in a wave of bombings and threats involving the Cuban Mission to the UN and tourist or other installations of countries which have been trading with Cuba. This has resulted in protests of the countries involved and in intensive efforts by law enforcement authorities both to protect these installations and to apprehend the perpetrators of these acts. Although the authorities have a pretty good line on a number of individuals believed to be associated with “Cuban Power”, so far there have been no arrests primarily because it has been impossible to get direct evidence of guilt or to catch any one in the act. Our Mission to the UN and we have urged the authorities to do everything possible to harass the suspects.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We still have several hundred U.S. citizens who have not been allowed to leave Cuba freely and, together with their “fireside alien relatives”, the repatriation group is estimated to number a few thousands. Starting with February of this year, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> agreed to allow the Mexicans to carry out one repatriation flight a month on a Mexican charter plane via Mexico. This operation has been carried out routinely since then. There are new registrations every month of U.S. citizens (primarily dual nationals) and the net figure has not been declining very much, but at least we have been getting out many of the hardship cases and those persons who have been waiting longest. The Mexicans hope to step up the frequency of the flights later, but do not feel the time is yet right to approach <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> about this.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>This has been proceeding in routine fashion ever since it began on December 1, 1965, on the basis of two flights a day, five days a week. We bring out about 3700 refugees a month and the total thus carried out is now about 120,000. This is listed as a problem only in the sense that the influx of refugees represents a burden, financially and in terms sometimes of domestic politics, and as of July 1, 1968, there has gone into effect a quota of 120,000 immigrants a year for the western hemisphere. It has been determined that Cuban refugees must be counted against this with a resulting impact on the number of immigrants from other countries, including Canada and Mexico, who can be admitted. The airlift refugees themselves do not immediately count against this quota inasmuch as they are “paroled” into the U.S., but when they convert into permanent residents they count as immigrants and are subtracted from the quota. INS has estimated that probably 40,000 a year will have to be so counted, and in addition there are the thousands of Cuban immigrants who come via Spain and other countries.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The general issue of retention of the naval base has not been in the forefront of issues for some time, even in the form of Cuban declarations, and in the last few years there have not been any fence-line shootings or other incidents of the type which caused tension in the past, but as long as we have the base there is always the possibility of incidents which could lead to serious consequences. Perhaps the main problem in the last year or two has been the increased use of the base as a means of escape from Cuba. The issue is somewhat sensitive (particularly as far as the Navy is concerned) in view of those provisions of the Guantanamo Base treaty which prohibit use of the base as a means of exit from or entry into Cuba. We have felt that we could not turn escapees back to the GOC and they are quietly evacuated by air to the mainland where they are “paroled” like other refugees. The GOC obviously knows of this but so far has not made a public issue of it. A correlary concern of ours has been over the possibility that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> might infiltrate agents by this route, although we subject such escapees to close screening after arrival.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                        </p>
                        <p>You are quite familiar with this. The basic problem is that European and other countries trading with Cuba are less and less inclined to cooperate in our program of economic denial toward Cuba,<note n="5" xml:id="d323fn5">The U.S. Government began a new element in its economic denial program towards Cuba during the fall of 1968 by working to delay and weaken the International Sugar Agreement approved by the UNCTAD Sugar Conference at Geneva on October 23.</note> both <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0793"/>because of commercial considerations and because of their feeling that Cuba is a U.S. problem not particularly of concern to them. The main present obstacle to increased trade by these countries is their growing doubt as to Cubaʼs credit worthiness in view of deteriorating economic conditions there and uncertainty as to the Soviet Unionʼs willingness to continue underwriting <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">8. Travel Controls</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Travel of U.S. citizens and residents to Cuba, along with that to Communist China, North Korea and North Viet Nam, is officially proscribed except for certain categories such as journalists, scholars, medical men and humanitarian cases. Court decisions, however, have virtually deprived the Department of the ability to enforce these controls except with respect to use of passports. Therefore persons who defy the ban are subject to no criminal penalties and not even to loss of passports unless it can be shown they used them in the banned countries.</p>
                        <p>A more particular problem for CCA is that even within the above admitted limitations, SCA shows little inclination to use what authority it has. Thus, for example, in examining applications for passport validation to go to Cuba, SCA does not, as in the past, insist on proof that the applicant is a <hi rend="italic">professional</hi> journalist but often wants to accept as credentials the applicantʼs own claim, supported by a letter from some publication (often of the “butcherʼs-wrapping-paper” variety) that if he can get to Cuba the publication will print an article by him. The same is true of “scholars”, SCA not requiring, as the original criteria did, that the scholar be an established one whose trip to Cuba is necessary for a particular research project. The result of all this is that we have a constant parade of U.S. radicals to Cuba on false pretenses and genuine scholars rarely go, as they cannot get Cuban visas.</p>
                        <p>The whole subject is such a farce that I would recommend dropping all travel controls on Cuba were it not for the fact that this would probably result in the resumption of the tourist trade on a significant scale. The result would not only be an economic advantage to Cuba but also a protection problem which, in the absence of diplomatic relations, we could not handle.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Cuba is a sensitive issue to almost everyone and we are subject to constant criticism from opposite points of view. On the one hand, persons who feel strongly about the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime, including Cuban exiles, attack us for not taking action to end the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> menace and, on the other hand, the growing U.S. leftist-liberal community criticizes us for being “rigid” in our policies and, openly or otherwise, advocates a policy of accommodation with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0794"/>
                        <p>In connection with the first school of criticism, one of the perennial charges is that there are still long-range missiles or other offensive weapons in Cuba. The intelligence community maintains a constant watch on this situation and, on the basis of all the evidence, believes that there are no offensive weapons or Soviet bases in Cuba, but reiteration of this assessment does not quiet anxiety more than temporarily. Excitement over this waxes and wanes but Cuba presents a more continuing issue in domestic politics than other countries in the hemisphere.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There was a considerable discussion of what our next moves toward Cuba should be. The Agency referred to a paper that it had submitted to the Department in April<note n="2" xml:id="d324fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> and which, according to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VVP1">Vaky</persName>, was still on the Secretaryʼs desk. In this paper, a copy of which is attached, the Agency discussed the possibility of approaching Cuban leaders around <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> to assure them that the U.S. had no wish to abrogate or wipe out the gains of the Cuban revolution and that it was prepared to cooperate with these leaders and indeed support them in any post-<persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime, if they were prepared to cooperate covertly <pb n="760" xml:id="pg_760" facs="0795"/>with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to provide information and perhaps to take timely action that would expedite the removal of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> as a regime leader.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VVP1">Vaky</persName> indicated that they felt some of the language of this proposal required modification but that it might provide a basis for discussion. It was felt especially that references to a post-<persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime or the suggestion of <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>ʼs removal were not appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Phillips, who runs the Cuban branch in DDP/WH, said that matters were reaching the point that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> really had to know how our policy toward Cuba was going to develop. Right now the issue was both confused and becalmed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName>ʼs speeches were being interpreted by some as opening up the possibility of Cuban-U.S. rapprochement. There was a world-wide impression that secret negotiations were in fact going on between Cuba and the United States.<note n="3" xml:id="d324fn3">In the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, July 18, Drew Pearson reported allegations of U.S. “diplomatic overtures to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> towards resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba.” <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>ʼs suggested guidance prepared that day by <persName corresp="#p_SRM1">Sayre</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName> for the noon briefing was that “No consideration is being given to resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba.” The guidance referred to a March 15 statement by <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName> in Miami, reiterating U.S. policy on Cuba: “We are not aware of any indication by Fidel <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> that he would like to resume diplomatic relations with the United States. On the contrary, as recently as February 1968 <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> is quoted by a foreign journalist as saying: ‘this kind of peaceful coexistence is of no interest to us—our quarrel with American imperialism is total and insurmountable. As to us, we have no contacts with the U.S. and have no desire for any.’” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, <gloss target="#t_ARACCA1">ARA/CCA</gloss> Files: Lot 73 D 191, Misc. Correspondence, <persName corresp="#p_FD1">FitzGerald</persName>, July–Sept 1968)</note> The domestic economic and political situation in Cuba was worse now than it had been any time under <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> (Phillips stated here that he never had been one of those who had depreciated the strength and endurance of the <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime) and actually the biggest thing that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> had going for him at the present time was the wide spread impression among second-echelon Cubans that he was negotiating some sort of political settlement with the United States.</p>

                        <p>What, Phillips wanted to know, did the Department wish to be done with this facility? Should we attempt to open up and pursue a dialogue or should we close it down immediately? <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName> said that at the moment a freeze should be put on any further talk and that it merely be indicated to the Cubans that the channel would be kept open for their use if they so desired.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the question of the wide-spread rumors that the United States and Cuba were in negotiations, Phillips asked what he might say if in fact he were approached by a member of the Cuban DGI and were asked if negotiations in fact were going on. <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName> replied <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0796"/>that we should deny that negotiations were taking place, but that we should add that the ball was in the Cuban court and that channels for negotiation existed.<note n="4" xml:id="d324fn4">According to an August 6 memorandum for the files, Arlene Gould of <hi rend="italic">Life en Español</hi> called on <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> that afternoon and asked if he would like to meet with Cuban UN Delegation member Jesús <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> responded: “I told her I did not wish to meet with Sr. Jimenez; if the Cubans are interested in making an official contact, other channels are available to them. With respect to the recent newspaper stories about U.S.-Cuban talks, I told her I was not aware of any such talks and that our position on the subject was clear.” ( <persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Cuba, Vol. IV, 1965–68)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VVP1">Vaky</persName> wanted to know if the question put by Phillips meant that the Agency intended to take the initiative in approaching Cuban intelligence, or whether <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> merely meant to remain passively prepared with an appropriate response in case it ever was approached by the Cubans with a query of the sort mentioned. Phillips replied that the Agency intended to await a Cuban initiative. Gardner said that if in fact rumors and reports of negotiations were working as strongly in Cubaʼs favor as Phillips had indicated, and if in fact we wanted to scotch reports that these negotiations existed, the method of denial just agreed upon seemed excessively demure. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VVP1">Vaky</persName> suggested that perhaps it would be better to instruct station chiefs in Latin America to see it through their own means that denials of the negotiations were effectively made in their own countries. The meeting ended without further concrete suggestions being made. The creation of a small study group with State, Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> participation to consider the question of what exactly we should do next about Cuba was made but no definite decision was reached.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that another meeting should be held to review this subject and what had been said about it in the current meeting. It was recognized that any decisions about changes or developments in our policy toward Cuba would have to be referred to a higher level.</p>

Murchison/Davidson interest in Haiti has been source of encouragement to Duvalier.

                                <item>Duvalier may be encouraged on present course by similarity present situation and that 1960. Thus in first six months 1960 USAID projects, which had begun make real progress, brought to complete halt by GOH insistence on unilateral control over hiring and firing and other key aspects USAID program. During resulting long impasse GOH requested <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to withdraw top Embassy, USAID and USIS personnel, at same time forcing many key Haitian personnel out of joint projects. May be recalled that <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> also was growing problem at that time and major test <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> opinion on Cuba shaping up.

                                <item>In late 1960 with arrival new U.S. Ambassador and offer substantial U.S. aid Duvalier professed great satisfaction and relations improved. Haiti later attempted blackmail U.S. at Punta del Este and when annual review USAID program arose in early 1962 Duvalier <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0798"/>again balked at accepting needed controls, leading eventually to phaseout program. Duvalier, however, undoubtedly recalls that tensions 1960 were followed in 1961 by his best year in terms U.S. assistance, when $14.1 million received in grants, including $6.0 million budget support.</item>

                                <item>No doubt current GOH calculations contain some elements desperation arising from continuing deterioration economic situation. Earlier “intellectual” supporters now largely disillusioned, leaving mainly most venal TTM-types as basis Duvalier power. These still under control but evidently restive as payoffs delayed. Duvalier accordingly under some pressure produce resumption U.S. aid or, if this not immediately possible, some sign from U.S. which can be interpreted as foreshadowing resumption aid.</item>

                                <item>Should however be noted that for Duvalier himself, intensely preoccupied with retention political power, problems of economic situation beneath him and even perhaps beyond his comprehension. He knows full well value of money in buying favors and protection but broader problems of economy he leaves to technicians. So long as they continue furnish him needed cash, and basic crops coffee, sugar and sisal continue assure some minimum economic activity, serious economic problems unlikely shake Duvalier resolve.</item>

                                <item>Duvalier has made it clear over past year he intends remain in control of Haiti until he dies, that he will use any means to this objective, and will not tolerate any threat to his political control.

                                <item>On surface it may seem paradox that Duvalier would deliberately request removal of EmbOffs at same time he trying get aid.<note n="3" xml:id="d325fn3">Telegram 720 to Port-au-Prince, December 19, 1963, reported a conversation between Irving Davidson, a registered agent for Duvalier, and Department officers, during which Davidson produced a letter allegedly from Duvalier asking for the quiet transfer of four Embassy officers for conspiring against the Government of Haiti, and stating that the new U.S. Ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Benson E.L. Timmons</persName> III, had made a bad impression and had displayed a “certain stiffness.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Country File, Haiti, Vol. I)</note> Explanation may lie party in distortions and miscalculations in Duvalierʼs thinking, as follows: new U.S. Amb shows U.S. recognizes Duvalier has successfully beaten down all challenges, is here to stay. U.S. must therefore make best of situation and try get Duvalier on side U.S. particularly since U.S. needs Haiti just now in <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> (Haitiʼs deliberate absence at COAS vote Dec 3 perhaps significant this respect). At same time, along with hopes for new era inspired by such possible misconceptions re U.S. motives, Duvalier may recently have begun to fear that arrival new Amb might signal new efforts unseat him. Seen in this light, USIS <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0799"/>progress in arousing pro-U.S. interest among Haitian students and intellectuals was potentially dangerous (so GOH cracked down on Haitian writers identified with USIS and put in Blanchet as Min Info). At about same time Duvalier focussed on Haseyʼs presence in Haiti. This interest and Haseyʼs immediate departure after FonOff request may have suddenly made plot theory plausible to Duvalier, and led to stories now circulating that Amb is “another Lodge” (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 492).<note n="4" xml:id="d325fn4">Telegram 492 from Port-au-Prince, December 18, 1963, reported Haitian Government skepticism and suspicions about <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName>. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1961–63, POL HAI–<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>)</note> This Duvalier attitude ambivalent: hopes for new era vs. fears of plot. By moving against selected Emb officers he hoped remove three key officers who would be highly useful to Emb in case plot theory correct, and could at same time test new era hypothesis at relatively little risk to himself. If U.S. acceded to request for withdrawal this would comfort Duvalier that new era theory right and enable him claim to supporters he in driverʼs seat vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, while maintaining GOH public position that no problems now exist in U.S.-Haitian relations.</item>

                                <item>Appears significant that in current gambit Duvalier really risking relatively little compared to what we would gain if successful. He has probably heard reports U.S. policy not changed, hence believes he has little to lose. He can, moreover, back off from this issue, if he decided to avoid showdown at this time, by saying he willing let affair pass “this time” as gesture good will toward <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and new Ambassador. With his own followers he can avoid loss prestige by saying privately “wait and see, it is only question of time,” meanwhile directing low-key or covert harassment and continuing work behind scenes for removal U.S. officials.</item>

                                <item>On balance we conclude that Duvalier will not initiate PNG action immediate future or retaliate against me by delaying presentation credentials indefinitely. However, risk of either or both certainly exists, since Duvalier now perhaps more than ever capable of faulty judgment and irrational acts.</item>

                            <item>I talked with Pres Duvalier for an hour and fifteen minutes this morning, after being kept waiting an hour. FonMin Chalmers and <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Raymond</persName> were with him, and Curtis accompanied me.

                            <item>While waiting in anteroom, Chalmers said he understood Duvalier wished have “private” exchange of views with me and to talk of general “spirit” of relations between Haiti and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>; while there would probably be mention of some subjects he (Chalmers) and I had already discussed, Duvalier wished specifics to be pursued between FonMin and myself.</item>

                            <item>Conversation between President and myself took place in a neutral atmosphere, which relaxed somewhat toward end of talk. Chalmers and <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Raymond</persName> said practically nothing, even when invited do so by Duvalier. Duvalier apparently made effort refrain from exhibiting any hostility and, for first time in Curtisʼs experience, even smiled broadly at several points. Duvalier looked alert and fit, although when he stood up at beginning and end of conversation he moved slowly and I thought with a bit of difficulty. One corner of presidential office filled with machine guns and miscellaneous weaponry, and usual security precautions were visible at all points inside and outside palace.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Most noteworthy feature of conversation was fact that Duvalier made no mention of reference, direct or indirect, to “four problems” or to any officer of the Embassy. He also omitted usual strictures against former <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Ambassadors.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Conversation was opened, after few words of greeting and amenities, by Duvalierʼs remark that he wants “close collaboration” between myself and Chalmers, <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Raymond</persName> and other ministers. He then embarked upon lengthy historical review, beginning with reference to “two oldest republics of hemisphere” and ending with my presentation of credentials (memcon will report all details). Inter alia he recalled <pb n="766" xml:id="pg_766" facs="0801"/>his 14 years collaboration with Americans, his studies at University Michigan, his policy of marching “side by side” with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in foreign policy and practice of voting with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in UN and other international bodies (citing Punta del Este and second Cuban crisis), his close relations with President Eisenhower, latterʼs $6 million grant (“not loan”) to Haiti, various unfilled Haitian requests to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> (road to Jacmel, jet airport), various recent invasion attempts (Dade County deputy sheriffs in 1958, Cubans in 1959, Cantave last year). Re credentials presentation, he stressed his desire do me utmost honor (ceremony held in audience chamber not used before, presidential guard in tenue de gala, turn-out of all GOH personnages, etc.). As clincher he said never before had he addressed formal remarks to a new Ambassador. (I suppressed strong temptation to say that in view nature his unpleasant remarks to me on that occasion, he would be wise revert to former practice.) Duvalier said these were all things he had wanted to tell me, adding that while they were perhaps not couched in language of diplomacy they were words of “a friend of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.” (Duvalier evidently at some pains to keep his recital fairly dispassionate.)</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>I then responded, saying I had come to Haiti with instructions to seek to improve relations between two governments if there was full and genuine desire on Haitian side to do so. It was in this spirit that Chalmers, <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Raymond</persName> and I had had two exploratory discussions, and I had thought it useful review main lines of what had been said so far with President Duvalier. I then referred to tourism and private investments as subjects that were of mutual interest and could I thought be usefully discussed. Duvalier countered with long statement of his personal solicitude for American tourists, orders he had given to police to protect and care for tourists, and traditional Haitian hospitality. He also made passing reference to fact that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> vessels had been “suppressed” from visiting Haiti. Re private investments, he said he hereby gave “green light” to Chalmers and <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Raymond</persName> to proceed with discussion these and other subjects with me.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Duvalier then went off into discussion of importance of “man” in diplomacy. I broke in to say that subject had be seen in its true perspective. I like other Ambassadors of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> spoke and acted under close instructions. There would undoubtedly be from time to time differences of view on this or that policy issue between GOH and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, as there were between all governments. It was however great mistake to attribute these differences of view to “some Ambassador or some Embassy officer.” I then made clear statement of need for mutual respect, saying that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> treats Haiti with respect and naturally expects and intends be so treated. Duvalier echoed this and added that cardinal principle for Haiti was “auto-determination.” Haiti had no intention trying tell <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> what to do but converse must equally be true. He then said a few halting words in English, largely to effect how much English he <pb n="767" xml:id="pg_767" facs="0802"/>forgotten since he left Michigan. (I suspect he has really forgotten very little.)</item>

                                    <item>As indicated above, conversation chiefly important for what Duvalier did not raise. There was no reference to famous “four problems” by Duvalier, and he took my rather pointed remark on “Ambassadors and Embassy officers” without any reaction. I naturally did not expect him to refer in any way to Davidson, Dec. 19 letter<note n="4" xml:id="d326fn4">See <ref target="#d325fn3">footnote 3, Document 325</ref>.</note> or similar events of recent history, and he did not.</item>

                                    <item>I will wish reflect on meaning Duvalier obviously intended <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to attach to conversation. It is tempting to conclude that, having met unyielding <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> position on “four problems” and being aware my oft-voiced discontent over delay in credentials presentation, his offensive remarks about my predecessors, and open threat over “four problems,” Duvalier has decided some minimum level mutual accommodation is in his own interest and will thus go along with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> step-by-step approach. However, having no desire figure in “famous last words” Department, I refrain from drawing such attractive conclusion. It does appear, however, that at least he is prepared have dialogue continue. Thus opening we have been seeking, to explore possibility reaching position where we can conduct with Duvalier at least the minimum business we need to in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> own self-interest, is probably at hand. In this connection, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should restrain its natural altruistic impulses toward Haiti. We can lose before we begin if we show ourselves too eager and come forward with too many goodies. Country Team and I are giving thought to some feasible way of testing and measuring Haitian performance, and I shall be forwarding my thoughts on this.</item>

I by no means exclude possibility that today was show-day, designed lull us while Duvalier pursues his objectives by other means. One defense is to continue handle intermediaries and agents provocateurs as Davidson has been dealt with.

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName> has made excellent progress in establishing the productive relations with Haiti that our own self-interests require.

                        <p>I am still looking into the Haiti problem; as a starter, the following may be useful:
<list>

                                <item>About a month and a half ago the GOH asked for grant emergency support. They gave no particular figure.</item>

                                    <p>State and the Embassy have been wrestling since then with the problem of replying to the GOH. The essence of our position is that we want to say “no” on this particular request, but at the same time, we do not want to close the door completely on future requests. First, we may need Haitiʼs <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> vote on one thing or another. Second, we may have to kick in at some time in order to stay in Haiti. State (<persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Tom Mann</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy Crockett</persName>) feels that we should not lose contact with Duvalier again. Haiti is only fifty miles from Cuba. Also, Duvalier is a sick man, and could drop dead at any moment; and we want to be around if and when it happens.</p>
                                    <p>One element in the equation is that Duvalier feels that if he could cut through the “bureaucratic nonsense” to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, he would get his money.</p>

                                <item>Recently, State sent a memorandum to the White House requesting that the President concur in a negative response to Duvalierʼs request for aid.

                        </p>
                        <p>(a) The United States is now faced with the prospect that the Duvalier regime will continue to rule Haiti for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances it is in the United States interest to seek to bring about at least a minimum level of mutual accommodation, realizing that room for such accommodation may be very limited and of dubious duration. United States interests range from the need to protect American citizens and property interests to ensuring that Haiti votes on the merit of questions of importance to the United States and the free world in international organizations and forums. The United States also has an abiding interest in the social and economic welfare of the Haitian people, although past experience shows that effective cooperation with the Duvalier regime in these fields is beset by very great difficulties. It may be possible to avoid many of the pitfalls of bilateral cooperation by bringing Haiti into a meaningful relationship with the Alliance for Progress including the <gloss target="#t_CIAP1">CIAP</gloss> and such international financial organizations as the <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss>, thus shifting primary responsibility to a multilateral “impersonal” organization. In any event, the well-being of the Haitian people or lack thereof has an important long-term bearing on the key United States interest of denying Haiti to the Communists.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Duvalier finally announced publicly July 8 that Haitian exiles had invaded Haiti. The announcement insisted that the Haitian armed forces were mopping up the invaders.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> informs me that 28 Haitian exiles did enter Haiti on the south COAS t, each armed with an M–1 rifle and about 1000 rounds of ammunition. They went into the mountains. The area in which they are operating is some of the best guerrilla territory in the world—mountainous, lots of caves, foliage, and fruit. Duvalier did send forces into the area but these forces got a bloody nose in their first encounter. They are now patrolling about 10 miles away from the area in which the exiles are located. Government forces are scared to go after the exiles.</p>
                        <p>Duvalier has considered such schemes as sending 75mm guns (mortar ammunition did not detonate); burning the villages in the area; sending the peasants in the area ahead of the soldiers in hopes the guerrillas would fire at the peasants and identify their positions, etc.</p>
                        <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0810"/>
                        <p>Duvalier has begun a general round-up of all relatives of any exiles from grandmothers to babes in arms. This is a terror tactic. He has told his household staff, if he goes, he will go like Hitler and level Portau-Prince.</p>
                        <p>It is too early to tell whether these few exiles will be successful. They apparently have little back-up material outside. Reports that the exiles may have been trained in Puerto Rico, Miami, or Cuba all appear unfounded. Nevertheless, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> asked that they all be run down.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>State is under intense pressure from the Haitians to approve an export license for thirty T–28 aircraft owned by a Dallas, Texas firm. Irving Davidson, a registered public relations man for Duvalier, has told State that Fred Orleans (a Texas lawyer and one of the Americans promoting the sale) insists that there is no need to worry about approval because the White House will overrule the State Department.</p>
                        <p>The Haitians have also presented a long shopping list for military equipment.</p>
                        <p>The pressure from the Haitians for the T–28ʼs may be an indication of Duvalierʼs concern about the small band of guerrillas operating in Haiti. The Haitian Army wants to machine-gun their positions since Haitian soldiers are afraid to tangle with them on the ground.</p>
                        <p>Another reason for the pressure might be that the Haitians involved have already received their payoff and they are worried about their skins if Duvalier does not get his aircraft.</p>

                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Since last January, when decision taken that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> self-interest required an attempt to reach minimum level mutual accommodation with Duvalier regime, I believe considerable progress made toward this objective, as shown most recently by GOH vote at <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss>. Our hand was never exactly full of cards, but ones we did have (resumption tourism, including naval visits and cruise ships; <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> water supply loan; resumption processing investment guaranties) proved useful. Backdrop against which this dialogue proceeded was of utmost importance. Duvalier, pathologically suspicious that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> playing with Haitian exiles against him, has repeatedly threatened in private get rid of me or entire Emb. On other hand, he restrained by what must be reluctance precipitate another serious incident in his relations with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, with unknown consequences. Meanwhile Duvalier has directed that three major official requests be made through me to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> for various items of assistance (budget-support aid last Feb; electric generators last March; export licenses for T–28 aircraft last week, reinforcing earlier request to Dept), to which he has recd refusal of first and no reply to last two. In addition there have been number of unofficial approaches through Davidson, Orleans, Sherman, etc.</item>

                            <item>Basic question has been and continues to be whether <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policy objective (maintain position here in attempt influence Haiti on matters important to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, such as <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, and deny Haiti to Communists) can be successfully pursued much longer under present conditions, i.e., unless Duvalier gets something more from dialogue than it has yet yielded to him.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Problem has two aspects: (a) present items in dialogue, always “low-yield”, have dwindled further. Although no official instruction <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0812"/>has yet reached us, there are seemingly well-founded indications that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has again suspended processing investment guaranties (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss>s 94),<note n="3" xml:id="d333fn3">Dated July 15. (Ibid., FN 9–3 HAI)</note> and intends block any further <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss>, IDA or <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loans to Haiti. If so, and with naval visits in suspense for several reasons, including recent exile incursion and subsequent suspension GTMOʼs support flight to PAP, virtually nothing would be left of original items except Grace Line cruise ships. (b) Meanwhile Duvalier injected into dialogue three items of his choice, as indicated para 2 above. In this context he undoubtedly attached very great importance to question of Haitiʼs participation in July 21 <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss>. He must have gone through roughly same analytical process we did, as to what various courses of action would yield him. It presumably became clear to him that Haiti would not have swing vote, and that even if it had such vote, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was in no mood bargain for Haitian support. In these circumstances seems evident he decided play it sweet and low for time being; hence elaborate little act of calling me in to receive copy of Chalmersʼ instructions, with request that these instructions be brought Pres <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>ʼs personal attention, and low-key approach which Chalmers took with you on July 20, all preparatory to casting of Haitian vote with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss>. (If however Chalmers sees you again before leaving <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, his tone may become more exigent, as has <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Raymond</persName>ʼs with me.) Another factor has of course been exile incursion, and calculation by Duvalier that as long as he was under the gun he could best discourage oppositionists by attempting give concrete evidence that GOH–<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> relations improving and he on side <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss> on Cuba was handiest subject for this purpose.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>In short, what Duvalier has gotten in last eight months has been <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> “neutrality” toward him (i.e., no official opposition to presidency for life), presence of an American Ambassador in PAP, widespread conclusion here and to some extent abroad that considerable détente achieved in GOH–<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> relations (of which he has made useful propaganda capital), and some benefits in tourism, etc. No matter how much he would like strike out at <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, he not likely abandon these advantages without close calculation, if past actions any guide. However, denial his outstanding requests (of which T–28s most important) could be enough tip balance toward some move by Duvalier against <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.

                            <item>Present arguments against any extension of existing <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance to Haiti, either economic or military, seem to me to be generally valid. Hemisphere considerations are important, and I am aware of <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0813"/>depth of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> public and Congressional distaste for Duvalier. At same time, reasons for maintaining strongest possible <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> presence are cogent, and I believe are becoming more so. If we continue deny all Duvalierʼs requests, we are essentially gambling that he will continue place such high value on lack of open <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> opposition to him that he will not risk return to dangerous conditions of 1963. We should be able reinforce this by such items as interest you expressed to Chalmers in assisting movement Haitian exile leaders out of DomRep. An early acknowledgment of Duvalierʼs “message” to President would also work in same direction. To go further would mean approving one of Duvalierʼs aid requests, such as aircraft or budget-support assistance. This would almost certainly buy considerable time but also give rise to expectations of more to come.</item>

                            <item>Given all factors, including tight limitations on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy toward Haiti at this time, I assume only feasible course is to continue present stance. There is one aspect that probably introduces a “cushioning” effect. If Duvalier does decide apply pressure on <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> by attempt oust me, there likely be quite a bit of advance warning, since Duvalier allergic to PNG action except as last resort. This would enable new look to be taken at situation. Goes without saying that use of term “present stance” implies continuation of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policies embodied in original dialogue, including processing investment guaranties and willingness go along with loans to GOH by <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> and other international lending agencies in cases where Haiti meets criteria. Under Deptʼs instructions I made quite categoric statements to GOH on these items, and I fear that any change, which could not be concealed for long from GOH, would seriously complicate matters here.</item>

                            <item>We have also given thought to possibility that Duvalier might attempt kick up some public incident in pre-electoral period. Curtis and Warner believe this unlikely; I generally share their view but would place odds somewhat shorter than they do.</item>

In view of todayʼs information regarding new invasion by unknown armed band at Madre Dame Marie and conflicting reports which we have concerning possible support by Dominican military of released Haitian internees, growing feeling here is that even if new rebel band has no connection with <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> we cannot afford to be implicated directly or indirectly with another attempt by Haitian internees to enter Haiti again from Dominican Republic. It would seem to us most inconsistent to directly or indirectly support intervention in Haitian internal affairs after having so recently condemned Cuban intervention in Venezuelan internal affairs. If you perceive no objection suggest you make this clear to <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid Cabral</persName> so that he can be under no misunderstanding about <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attitude. You may furthermore inform him that it seems quite possible Haiti will decide to bring matter before <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and that we are anxious that Dominican government have clean hands in event this should happen.</p>

                                <p>The better Haitians, who are all in opposition to Duvalier, would be greatly heartened. Their bitterness toward the U.S. for tolerating Duvalier would be blunted. We would garner support for such a policy from many of our own people and the people of the Hemisphere who abhor Duvalier. If the policy resulted in Duvalierʼs overthrow, it would open the prospect for establishment of a less repugnant successor government.</p>

                                <p>To undertake an interventionist policy such as this would be to assume very grave responsibility for the consequences. In the final analysis we can ensure the establishment and continuation of a less repugnant post-Duvalier government only if we are prepared to install and control it with force of arms if necessary. To undertake an interventionist <pb n="781" xml:id="pg_781" facs="0816"/>policy in Haiti without being prepared to go the whole way to ensure its success would be to invite a double curse on our house, i.e., (a) to have intervened, and (b) to have failed.</p>
                                <p>An interventionist policy in Haiti would represent a major shift of U.S. policy in Latin America. Our enemies would exploit it to the fullest. Many of our friends would see in it a precedent involving much greater dangers to their interests than does Duvalierʼs continuation. We could expect major and continuing criticism.</p>
                                <p>Assuming we were prepared to bear the consequences in order to do something meaningful for the Haitian people, the needs are so monumental that even the unrestrained application of our resources could be expected to make only a modest impact for at least a generation. Thus, the initial and continuing foreign policy price would be great. The long-term cost to our economy would be very high. But demonstrable and real benefits would be quite small, at least through the mid-term.</p>

                                <p>Substantial input of funds and technical assistance would alleviate the great suffering of Haitiʼs masses to some extent in the short run and would offer improved prospects for the countryʼs future. A substantial U.S. developmental effort might give us some leverage in softening Duvalierʼs brutal oppression of the Haitian people.</p>

                                <p>All of the better elements of Haiti (who are in opposition to Duvalier) would decry such a policy as strengthening Duvalierʼs hand at home and abroad. Many of our own people and the people of the Hemisphere would denounce our support of a brutal dictatorship. Experience has demonstrated that Duvalier prefers to forego U.S. assistance unless he can get it on his terms and exploit it to his maximum advantage. This would minimize benefits accruing to the Haitian people while maximizing benefits to Duvalier and his supporters. Reactivation of an assistance program in Haiti would be taken as a sign of U.S. weakness by Duvalier and would probably provide little if any additional leverage in dealing with him.</p>

                                <p>The U.S. position would be clear for all to see. We would satisfy most of those who criticize us for consorting with Duvalier. We would continue to enjoy a presence in Haiti.</p>

                                <p>It is unlikely that Duvalier would long tolerate a U.S. presence in Haiti under these circumstances, but would force a confrontation offering two alternatives: (a) a softening of the policy, or (b) the expulsion of our Ambassador and possibly our entire mission. At the very least, our ability to exploit our presence in Haiti would be greatly circumscribed.</p>

Criticism and bitterness will be engendered, creating problems for the U.S. now and in the future. Elements of the Haitian opposition who offer the best hope for the countryʼs future are estranged by such a policy. It is a difficult policy to implement because it has few tangible benefits for Duvalier. Consequently, he is constantly tempted to force a confrontation which might deny him the limited benefits he now enjoys over the short run but offers prospects of more tangible returns as the price for a future rapprochement. To stay this temptation, Duvalier must be kept in doubt about future U.S. intentions and the value which the U.S. places on maintaining a presence in Haiti.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that he wished to comment briefly regarding the mounting of military forays against Haiti from United States soil. The Secretary emphasized that such action is illegal in the United States and that the policy of the United States Government is not to permit such action to occur on its territory. The Secretary said that it is not possible to take action against people who only plot with their tongues—that, too, would be contrary to our law. However, the United States would be pleased to be informed through our Embassy of any actual plots the Government of Haiti believes might be afoot. He assured the Foreign Minister that the United States would take measures, as it had in the past, against such action.</p>
                        <p>The Haitian Foreign Minister replied that there have been several conversations through the two Embassies on this matter. He recognized that the United States Government does not tolerate such action on United States soil. He said that he fully realized that when the Government of Haiti reports such suspicions to the American Embassy that they are transmitted to Washington. The Minister said that he wished to speak frankly, however that in the last invasion, the Haitian Government took two prisoners and a large amount of matériel. He said that a large part of this matériel had come from Syracuse, New York and, although the prisoners may have been attempting to mislead the GOH, they made statements to the effect that they had been trained on United States territory. He said that he had discussed the matter with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName>, saying that he did not believe the United States <pb n="784" xml:id="pg_784" facs="0819"/>was responsible. However, at this time, he wished to suggest the possibility of some low-level United States officials being involved, or persons who belong to some “quasi organization.” The Minister concluded that he believed it behooved him to prepare a complete file on this subject for the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would appreciate this, and asked that the Minister have the American Embassy address the report to his personal attention. He repeated his disavowal of any United States participation in rebel activities, and said that all over the world rebel elements falsely claim the support of the United States for their own advantage.</p>

This was not true at all.” (Ibid., Papers of <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Thomas C. Mann</persName>, Telephone Conversations with LBJ, January 4, 1964–April 30, 1965)</note> The arrival of two T–28ʼs in Haiti earlier this year in the face of a ban of export licenses is what whetted their curiosity. Szulc and Collier have apparently been working together. They tried to develop the thesis with the Director of Caribbean Affairs that the United States Government was conspiring with Duvalier to provide arms, despite the fact that we refused an export license. They apparently gave this up as a bad theory, but are now on the tangent that the Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> are preventing prosecution because they are unwilling to let a key witness testify. This witness can apparently testify to the fact that the aircraft in Haiti are in fact the ones smuggled out of Florida.</p>

He regards our present policy as perfectly defensible. We have done everything we can to prevent arms shipments to Haiti, including obtaining an arms embargo by all the Europeans, which is effective. Although <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> regards Duvalier as the worst dictator in the Hemisphere, and would be happy to see him go, no one has suggested any way to do it except by force. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> regards this an unacceptable course. Even if this were done, no one has a satisfactory alternative in prospect. Haiti has never had a reasonably decent government, even by Latin standards.

As will be indicated below, the Haitian Government responded affirmatively to all such requests made by the United States Government (except in one case—the suspension of an expulsion order against an American citizen), while at the same time the United States Government, in accord with the established policy, successfully rejected all Haitian requests <pb n="786" xml:id="pg_786" facs="0821"/>and maneuvers to obtain the resumption of United States economic and military assistance to Haiti.</item>

                                <item>During the period under review the desired United States presence in Haiti was maintained, and two attempts by the Haitian Government (in December, 1963 and January, 1964) to bring about the withdrawal of three key Embassy officers (Army Attaché, Chief of Political Section, and Public Affairs Officer) were decisively defeated. I made clear to the Haitian Foreign Minister in January, 1964 (a month after my arrival here) that the Haitian Government was naturally free to declare these officers persona non grata, but in that case the United States Government would retaliate against Haitian Government personnel in the United States on a one-for-one basis. The Haitian Government dropped the matter.</item>

                        <p>As pointed out under e. Risks <hi rend="italic">Involved</hi>, Duvalierʼs reaction to this operation could be quite sharp. It is possible that our ability to maintain a presence in Haiti will be threatened. In recommending approval of the program, the Department emphasizes the importance of avoiding, to the extent possible, program content which would tend to direct Duvalierʼs displeasure towards the United States, rather than the Haitian exile community. To this end, particular care will be required in preparing that portion of broadcasts originating in the U.S. which is aimed at disassociating the United States from Duvalier in the Haitian mind.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister Chalmers stated that the Government of Haiti lacks weapons and ammunition with which to defend itself against outside attack; he said that this problem is of particular concern to his government at present in view of the situation in the Dominican Republic.<note n="2" xml:id="d340fn2">A May 4 briefing memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_VJH1">Vaughn</persName> to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> for this meeting recommended that the Secretary receive Chalmers, since “the need for Haitiʼs vote at the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> is clear” and “Chalmers is one of the few <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss> delegates who has expressed broad general support for our recent actions in the Dominican Republic.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL HAITI–<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>)</note> Chalmers stated that Haiti has made numerous efforts to obtain arms during the past year but that none of these efforts has been successful. He added, slowly and emphatically, “this will become a question”, repeating the statement several times. (Note: He did not mention specifically his governmentʼs several unsuccessful requests for U.S. military assistance nor did he make specific reference to the equally unsuccessful applications for munitions control export licenses. He also avoided mention of Haitiʼs attempt to smuggle weapons out of the United States.)</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>In the two and a half weeks since the fall of the <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid Cabral</persName> government, the Dominican crisis has had only a very limited impact on the situation in Haiti. This could change quickly however if the several Haitian exile activists now serving with the Dominican rebel forces should succeed in obtaining rebel logistic support for an invasion of Haiti.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>From the outset of the Dominican crisis, official Haitian reaction has been one of ill-disguised fear that <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Juan Bosch</persName>, or someone answerable to him, might gain control of the government in Santo Domingo. Haitian officials have seized eagerly on the leftist infiltration of the present pro-<persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> forces as a pretext for their fears, and have underscored again and again their willingness to go along with any move to brand <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> a threat to the security of the hemisphere. As a practical matter, Haitiʼs fear of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has little to do with the issue of Communism and is based primarily on <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName>ʼs association with leaders of the non-Communist left, principally <persName corresp="#p_FFJ1">Figueres</persName>, Betancourt, and Munoz Marin, all of whom are openly and loudly critical of the Duvalier dictatorship to the point of having pressed for <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> censure of the regime. <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> himself, during his brief tenure in office, permitted Haitian exiles to launch two probes against Haiti from Dominican soil.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Haitian Exile Groups</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Usually reliable sources report that Haitian exiles living in Santo Domingo obtained a sizeable quantity of weapons when the Dominican rebels stormed the Fortaleza Ozama on April 30. Among these exiles were two individuals who participated in Dominican-based guerrilla invasions of Haiti in June and August of 1964. These two, plus their French military advisor, are currently members of <pb n="790" xml:id="pg_790" facs="0825"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Colonel Caamano</persName>ʼs inner circle according to recent reports. The acquisition of arms and of influential new Dominican contacts materially changes the power position of these exiles. The <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid Cabral</persName> government had disarmed and/or interned most of these exiles under pressure from the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. To date there are no indications that the exiles have organized themselves for an invasion but they have reportedly expressed their intention of doing so as soon as the situation permits.</p>
                        <p>Relations with the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>The immediate practical effect of Haitiʼs newly revived fear of <persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> has been to mute the otherwise predictable criticism of the use of U.S. military forces in Santo Domingo and to soften, temporarily, Haitiʼs perpetual attempts to blackmail the U.S. in <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> meetings. During the current Meeting of Consultation, Haitiʼs fears have dictated support for the U.S. position, without haggling. At the same time, however, there are indications that Duvalier may soon attempt to trade on his “cooperation” and on the proximity of the Dominican crisis to make a bid for the resumption of large-scale U.S. aid. Even before the start of the Dominican crisis, Foreign Minister Chalmers said he believed it would be useless for the forthcoming Rio <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> conference to discuss “the strengthening of representative democracy” without giving attention to the underlying question of “reinforcing the respective economies”.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Internal Repercussions</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is no evidence that security measures have been tightened in Haiti nor that the border garrisons have been reinforced. There have been reports that one of the two Haitian Communist parties (the PPLN) and several other small, disorganized opposition groups—all of which are clandestine—have discussed the implications for Haiti of the Dominican crisis but there has been nothing to indicate that any group plans overt action on the face of Duvalierʼs ruthless repressive tactics. Aggressive broadcasts by Radio Havana, in Creole to Haiti, urging Haitians to back the Dominican rebels, have had no visible effect.</p>
                        <p>The Haitian economy, chronically shaky and recently in a state of near paralysis, has not been affected by the Dominican situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Possible Impact in the Next Few Months</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One of the most obvious possibilities for the near future is that the Haitian exiles now serving with the Dominican rebels may attempt an invasion of Haiti under cover of the present confusion in Santo Domingo.</p>
                        <p>If these exiles should find themselves able to move, they could well succeed in bringing Duvalier down with as few as 300 well equipped men. Their failure to do so in 1964 can be ascribed in large <pb n="791" xml:id="pg_791" facs="0826"/>part to the lack of support from the Dominican side of the border, lack of trained manpower (no invasion group numbered more than 30 or 40), and a lack of suitable equipment.</p>
                        <p>In 1964, despite the exilesʼ poor logistics and support, Duvalier was unable to effectively control the invasion areas for four months (July through early November). The exiles now in the best position to mount an invasion, i.e., those in Santo Domingo, have had no pronounced ideological orientation but reportedly have drawn closer to leftist groups in recent months for lack of support from other quarters.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName>ʼ assessment of Duvalierʼs probable reaction to this and to other factors in the situation is set forth in the attached telegram (Port-au-Prince 1489, May 11, 1965).<note n="2" xml:id="d341fn2">Telegram 1489 from Port-au-Prince, May 12, reported <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName>ʼ discussions with Chambers and <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Raymond</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName>ʼ analysis that Duvalier favored an authoritarian regime in the Dominican Republic, as far to the right as possible. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–9 DOM REP)</note> While it is possible, as stated in the Embassy assessment, that Duvalier might accept or even welcome U.S. military intervention in the event of an invasion, such intervention would almost certainly create serious difficulties for the U.S. in terms of hemisphere opinion and would be likely to backfire within Haiti after a short time, given Haitiʼs vivid memories of the U.S. Marine occupation of 1915–1934.</p>

                            <item>Since Francois Duvalierʼs accession to power in 1957, he has attempted to destroy every force which could possibly overthrow him. <pb n="792" xml:id="pg_792" facs="0827"/>The military, which has been the traditional kingmaker in Haiti, lost most of its power in 1958 when the National Security Volunteers (VSN-Militia) and the secret police (Ton-Ton Macoute-bogeymen) were created as counterforces. Since that time there have been repeated purges within the military. Those who have been purged have been replaced by Duvalier favorites who owe their positions to him. A civil service does not exist. All government employees are hired on the basis of their loyalty to Duvalier. Even cabinet officers are changed frequently to prevent their building up any following. Discontent is believed to be widespread, but opposition, both real and imagined, is ruthlessly and immediately suppressed.</item>

                            <item>Over the years there have been numerous incursions by anti-Duvalier Haitian exiles. In August and September 1963 several incursions took place on the northern border area, the last with a force of over 100 men. These expeditions met with failure, however, because Duvalier was alerted and because of the poor leadership of the exile commander, Brig. Gen. Leon Cantave. Cantave has since lost exile support.</item>

                            <item>From June to September 1964 two separate groups invaded Haiti. One group of about 30 came from the Dominican Republic and operated in the southeastern portion of the southern peninsula for several weeks, then crossed back into the neighboring republic where they were temporarily interned by Dominican officials. The other group landed on the southwestern portion and was comprised of 13 men. This group was probably the best trained and equipped that has operated in Haiti. The Haitian military were unable to engage them for several months, but the group was finally worn down until all had been captured and killed. It is significant to note that a force of only 13 men operating in the countryside were capable of running the Haitian Armed forces (FAdH) ragged for several months. The FAdH was demoralized at its inability to engage the enemy. There were complaints that the army lacked good field support and sufficient supplies. Another widespread complaint was that the VSN—Duvalierʼs favorite—was not up to the task of fighting for the country.</item>

                            <item>The last two incursions were eventually beaten back, but only at great cost to the economy. Haiti has been unable to recover fully and is now in serious economic straits. Government employees are not paid for months on end. The Duvalier government has repeatedly asked for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic aid.

                            <item>During the past several weeks we have had reports that some Haitian exiles are fighting with the rebels in the Dominican Republic. These exiles are probably led by Andre Riviere, a French soldier of fortune. He is reported to have fought in Indochina, and is an expert in guerrilla tactics. In the past several years Riviere has instructed anti-Duvalier exiles—numbering about 70–100—in the Dominican Republic. Those Haitians presently fighting with the rebels may be some of those which he has trained. One of the exilesʼ perennial complaints was that they lacked arms; however, they may have acquired some from the Dominicans. At present Riviere—who reportedly has had Communist ties in the past—is a translator and military adviser to Manuel Montes Arache—one of the leaders of the Dominican rebel command.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>There are no alternative sources of political power in Haiti today. The army, stripped of its best officers, is powerless to act against the regime and its armed rabble, the National Security Volunteers (VSN). There are no political parties other than the two communist parties which operate clandestinely. All power rests with President Duvalier who has relentlessly smashed all overt opposition.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">II. The External Threat</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>No presently established group of Haitian exiles in the United States is capable of invading Haiti.</p>
                        <p>A potential threat to the Duvalier regime exists in the Dominican Republic. There, several Haitians who have long been identified with anti-Duvalier activities are known to be serving with <persName corresp="#p_CCF1">Colonel Francisco Caamano</persName>. It is reliably reported that arms have been put at the disposal of these men. One of them has stated that these arms are to be used to liberate Haiti. They are trained guerrilla fighters and four of them are known to have participated in two previous invasions of Haiti.</p>
                        <p>It is further reported that nearly all of the trained men (30–60) who took part with them in the previous invasions are also with the rebels and have their own Headquarters in Santo Domingo. From the reservoir of 80,000 Haitians in the Dominican Republic they can probably build a new invasion force of as many anti-Duvalierists as they can arm and lead.</p>
                        <p>Equating these facts with the belief that a well-armed and determined force of from 200 to 300 men, well-trained and well-supplied, could overthrow the Haitian government, the danger should not be minimized. The Communists inside the country, although few in number—approximately 500 hard core—are the best organized and best disciplined of all opposition elements and can be counted on to attempt to seize power in the period immediately following Duvalierʼs disappearance. They could also be counted on to capitalize on an invasion attempt, especially if it came from leftist-led elements in the Dominican Republic. There is indication of outside direction from international communism through Haitian party members in Mexico City, Paris and Moscow. They have sympathizers in cabinet positions in the present government. The masses, long-suffering and apathetic, and exhorted daily by Radio Havana Creole language broadcasts, could likely be swung behind the leaders. Those in the provincial areas, especially the southern peninsula, are reliably reported to be tense, and ready for a revolt with racial implications at the slightest opportunity.</p>
                        <p>If the new government of the Dominican Republic assumes a posture unfavorable to the exiles, their capability to mount an effective invasion of Haiti will be diminished. If the new government is of leftist persuasion, action against Duvalier may be expected. In that case Haiti <pb n="795" xml:id="pg_795" facs="0830"/>might fall quickly to the Dominican-based rebels and their Communist-oriented associates.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>An attempt to overthrow the Duvalier government by effective forces of Haitian, or other, leftist elements now in the Dominican Republic, would demand pre-emptive action.</p>
                        <p>Internal revolt by disgruntled members of Duvalierʼs entourage, which is an accepted possibility, would likewise call for pre-emptive action to forestall accession by undesirables, unless an understanding had been reached with the Haitian Army leaders to the effect that order would be maintained until acceptable exiles could be returned.</p>
                        <p>Sudden deterioration of Duvalierʼs health, which is known to be poor, would precipitate a crisis in which similar immediate action would be necessary.</p>
                        <p>The above conclusions are drawn in the belief that no individual, or group of individuals, now in Haiti or outside it, with enough power to seize control, is free of Communist influence, or acceptable to the U.S. Government by any standards applicable to its own, or hemispheric, interests.</p>

                        <p>“Dramatic events” in DomRep point up relationship peace and stability to prosperity. For Haiti all three depend on help from “friendly and understanding <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>,” and international banking institutions. Haitian people have courageously endured natural catastrophes and economic difficulties for years but must be extricated from “economic strangulation.” Duvalier has long seen need for changed <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attitude (as leader Hemisphere) to end “steady deterioration” in relations between states, and particularly “to understand me.” Despite being “less well understood,” GOH has accepted “policy of sacrifice in hope … of resurrection of national economy by injection of fresh dollars … for works of infrastructure” such as roads, harbor works, communications, hydro projects, sugar mills, irrigation, airports and other “realistic projects <pb n="797" xml:id="pg_797" facs="0832"/>for an aid program.” “Foundered economy of Haiti cannot through its own efforts … be reinvigorated.” “Adequate injection of money and capital to put country back on its feet” is necessary. “This can only come from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>… in form generous aid … long term loans …, economic and technical assistance …” Duvalier is “sure” that Presidentʼs “personal attention to economic situation of Haiti” will permit quick action “in way Pres Eisenhower did six years ago.” Closes with “fervent hopes for … fruitful cooperation in all fields between <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Haiti.”<note n="4" xml:id="d344fn4">Telegram 1594 from Port-au-Prince, June 5, reported <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName>ʼ preliminary reactions to Duvalierʼs letter. He concluded that the request for an appointment for Theard to deliver the “confidential letter” was probably a maneuver to test the “temperature of water in Washington.” <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName> observed that Duvalierʼs aid request was “clearly related” to the crisis in the Dominican Republic and consequent <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> actions, in which Haiti provided the necessary 14th vote on several occasions. He noted that the “administrative letter” was the 7th request for U.S. aid since the “current phase” of relations began in December 1963, but that this was the first time Duvalier had personally made such a request. <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName> asked whether any change in current policy toward Haiti was needed.

                        <p>Haitians in Paris and in French universities, numbering in the hundreds, are being wooed by the Communists among them, reportedly to demonstrate to the French Communist Party that the financial support being channelled to them from Moscow is justified.</p>

                        <p>Radio Havana continues its inflammatory barrage in the Creole language, exhorting Haitians inside the country to revolt against Duvalier and the U.S., whom they treat as a single oppressor.</p>
                        <p>There are unconfirmed reports that small quantities of arms have been smuggled to the Communists in Port-au-Prince.</p>
                        <p>Plotters are reported to be at work in inner circles of the Haitian government where Communist sympathizers are tolerated.</p>
                        <p>Reports on Duvalierʼs health run the gamut from indigestion to his death. He may safely be considered in questionable health.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he wished to discuss the economic and financial situation in his country. He said conditions are very poor. Contributing factors are two hurricanes in the relatively recent past, lower incomes from coffee, sisal, and sugar, and a lower income from tourism because of the situation in the Dominican Republic. Because of near famine in parts of the country, the government has had to feed 600,000 people for about 6 months. The government of Haiti is unable to remedy the situation alone. The Foreign Minister turned to Minister Desinor and asked him to add to the presentation.</p>
                        <p>Minister Desinor repeated that the country is unable on its own resources to come out of its dire economic plight. Haiti needs outside <pb n="802" xml:id="pg_802" facs="0837"/>help, and he wondered how the United States could assist. Minister Desinor also suggested that it might be in order for the United Nations Special Fund to supply economic assistance because of the decline in income from coffee.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he would explore the possible applicability of the UN Special Fund in the Haitian situation. The Secretary added that the Inter-American Development Bank with our concurrence is already studying the initiation of a number of educational projects for Haiti.</p>
                        <p>Minister Desinor suggested that the projects under consideration by the Inter-American Development Bank are more social in nature, whereas the most urgent need of the country is for economic development. He dwelt on economic development as a fundamental, pressing need. He then referred to Haitiʼs requests for U.S. assistance as outlined in two recent letters to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, one delivered to our Ambassador in Port-au-Prince and the other delivered to our Chief of Protocol. Minister Desinor suggested that social progress that is not accompanied or backed by economic development may become a serious burden on the country.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that in the past we had had some differences, not strictly political, but more in the nature of administrative problems in carrying out our aid activities in Haiti. The Secretary suggested that perhaps we should have a fresh start, a new look, on both sides, through frank and private discussions. The Secretary said that, speaking frankly to good friends, it was a matter of concern to him that Haiti, an important country in the Western hemisphere and situated so near to the worldʼs richest market, had such a low standard of living and had made virtually no economic progress during his tenure as Secretary of State. What is needed is statesmanship of the highest order to identify and remove the obstacles to progress, to assist the Haitian people to move into the modern world. At times matters become too entangled at the highest level, and perhaps a more down-to-earth approach, say, for instance, meeting the problems of a particular village, would help. Somehow there must be found a way to light up the imagination of the Haitian people to do more on their own with what is available, with their own resources. For instance, professional Haitians, such as doctors, who go off to other countries where individual opportunities are greater, might be encouraged to stay home and devote their talents to their own people. Haiti probably would find an affectionate interest in the hemisphere in its efforts to improve conditions.</p>
                        <p>Minister Desinor said that Haiti appreciated the understanding which the Secretary displayed, and his country would like very much to pursue discussions along this line with the United States. He added that while it was important to work from the people up it was even <pb n="803" xml:id="pg_803" facs="0838"/>more essential to provide the people with much needed jobs, food and health facilities. Minister Desinor again emphasized that the fundamental problems of his country derive from economic stagnation, and he said that an injection of dollars into the economy is needed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and the Foreign Minister agreed that the two countries would continue discussions on this general subject.</p>

                        <p>There is attached (Tab B) a translation of a letter of August 12 to the President from President Duvalier of Haiti, and a recommended response to be signed by you (Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d348fn2">Tabs A and B are attached, but not printed. At Tab B was the “confidential” letter which, according to a handwritten note file with the translation of Duvalierʼs letter, indicates it was hand delivered by the Haitian Ambassador to Chief of Protocol Lloyd Hand for the President and delivered to the White House on September 16. (Johnson Library, Special Head of State Correspondence File, Haiti-Duvalier Correspondence)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Duvalierʼs rambling six-page letter appears intended to prompt an offer of renewed <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military assistance and to remind the President that we have not acted favorably on an earlier letter, received in June,<note n="3" xml:id="d348fn3">Reference is to the “administrative” letter; see <ref target="#d344">Document 344</ref>.</note> requesting resumption of large-scale economic aid (except for a verbal acknowledgment by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName> no reply was made to the June letter). Although the letter of August 12 proposes that Duvalier and the President “have a meeting”, the context indicates fairly clearly that Duvalier is willing to view the proposed meeting as spiritual and figurative rather than physical.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the President should not sign a letter to Duvalier. Any communication from the President-however innocuous-might <pb n="804" xml:id="pg_804" facs="0839"/>receive publicity which we would prefer to avoid. While I do not discount the possibility that Duvalier might react strongly to this apparent “brush off” of his overtures to the President, I believe that it is unlikely that his annoyance will take any overt form. As you know, Haitiʼs chronic economic problems have reached new proportions and there are indications that Duvalier feels that he cannot afford any action that might affect Haitiʼs standing with the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> or the international agencies from which he also hopes to gain assistance. Even though I am now reviewing our position in Haiti to determine whether there are some areas in which we might be able to offer some accommodation to Duvalier, I believe it would be unwise to delay further our reply to his letter.</p>

                            <item>Comments this tel of necessity highly compressed. Dept already has available Embʼs extensive analysis of Haitian situation and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy <pb n="805" xml:id="pg_805" facs="0840"/>as they have evolved during past two years. I consider that basic <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy goal as laid down in current LAPC paper<note n="4" xml:id="d349fn4">See <ref target="#d329">Documents 329</ref> and <ref target="#d338">338</ref>.</note> remains entirely valid, i.e. maintenance effective <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> presence (i.e. Amb and essential Emb personnel) in Haiti so as to be in position influence events when Duvalier passes from scene, and to frustrate any Communist attempt to take over before or after. Meanwhile, there other short-run policy objectives of considerable importance to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> national interests here, including (a) persuading GOH to support <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> positions in <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, UN and other international orgs, (b) protection <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> nationals and investments in Haiti, (c) servicing GOH debts to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and private <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> citizens (GOH recently resumed service on debts to Ex-Im Bank and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>). Concurrently, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has in operation two very limited programs of assistance to Haiti (malaria eradication and Title III <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 assistance through vol agencies) which are designed benefit Haitian people directly and avoid political exploitation by Duvalier.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>As Dept aware, GOH has acceded to all <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> requests for support in last two years (see especially Embʼs A–332, Feb 24).<note n="5" xml:id="d349fn5">
                                    <ref target="#d338">Document 338</ref>.</note> Particularly important examples were (a) GOH support of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> at 1964 <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss> on Cuba, (b) at time of landing <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces in DomRep last April, and (c) subsequently at 10th <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss> on DomRep. GOH has also consistently supported <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> on UN items, including Chinese representation, disarmament and Article 19, and at <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> request made statement in UNGA Oct 1 this year generally supporting <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy in Viet-Nam (Depcirtel 3166<note n="6" xml:id="d349fn6">To all posts, August 30. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> and <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss>s 166<note n="7" xml:id="d349fn7">Dated September 17.

(Ibid., POL HAI-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>)</note> I need not emphasize that such support does not imply any change in character of Duvalier regime, which remains brutal and regressive dictatorship, but is motivated entirely by GOH self-interest (e.g. fear that Caamano/<persName corresp="#p_BJ4">Bosch</persName> govt in DomRep would have allowed Haitian exiles mount operations against Haiti) and hope that GOH support of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would lead to resumption of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic and military assistance to Haiti. Landing of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops in DomRep has also undoubtedly had salutary effect on Duvalier (as well as on local Communists), although some desperate act (such as firing PAP) by Duvalier in event of, say, substantial exile invasion, is always possibility (<gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> htp 784).</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>I remain reasonably confident that even if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> makes no reply at all to Duvalierʼs two letters, he will not attempt PNG reprisals against <pb n="806" xml:id="pg_806" facs="0841"/>
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> presence here although he remains intensely suspicious <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intentions toward him (see especially [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]).<note n="9" xml:id="d349fn9">Not found.</note> However, he might be tempted begin withhold some of full GOH support now being accorded <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy. This connection, I assume it important that GOH continue vote with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> on unfinished DomRep business in 10th <gloss target="#t_MFM1">MFM</gloss>. There is also upcoming Rio Conference to consider. These and other factors indicate desirability avoiding any flatly negative response (or fail to respond at all) to Duvalierʼs June 3 letter and indeed point to need insure maintenance low key “lowcost” dialogue with GOH, so as to keep ball in play in <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>ʼs own self-interest. Examples of items recently injected into dialogue from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side are resumption of carefully-spaced <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> naval visits to PAP for R and R (<gloss target="#t_D1">Deptel</gloss> Wirom 71)9 and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> approval in principle of GOH request Oct 8 for increase in modest Title III program (<gloss target="#t_D1">Deptel</gloss> 104).<note n="10" xml:id="d349fn10">Dated August 23.

                            <item>Focusing these considerations down to Duvalierʼs June 3 letter, I recommend following approach, dealing first with substance of reply, and then form.</item>

                                <p>(A) Request in June 3 letter covers both bilateral <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> econ assistance, and also loans from international financial institutions such as <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss>.</p>
                                <p>(B) Duvalier basically wants a bilateral “injection of dollars” into Haiti by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, e.g., general budget-supporting assistance. I remain completely opposed for several reasons. On technical side, money would simply go into pockets of regime without benefit to Haitian people, and it would be impossible for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to control. Of even more weight is fact any such aid would constitute, and would be so interpreted in Haiti and outside, as <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> political support for regime. This clearly undesirable and unacceptable to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, and to Congressional and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> public opinion.</p>
                                <p>(C) However, as Dept has had in mind for some time (<gloss target="#t_D1">Deptel</gloss> 694, June 25),<note n="11" xml:id="d349fn11">Actually dated June 24, not June 25. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>) HAI)</note> and as was I believe touched on by Secy in talk with Chalmers Oct 8, it seems desirable to explore with GOH whether a carefully delimited social-benefit project, to be financed indirectly with <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds, could be undertaken, while avoiding political and administrative problems which brought almost all direct <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> econ assistance to Haiti to an end in 1962–63. Have in mind project whereby a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> university or private foundation, with <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> financing, would work with GOH on creating effective national health service (NHS). This would <pb n="807" xml:id="pg_807" facs="0842"/>be vehicle for attacking many types medical and public health problems in Haiti, and consolidating gains from Malaria Eradication Program, now well advanced. But, most importantly, such an NHS could be vehicle for implementing a population program, if GOH decides embark on one. A response along this line would be very limited but nevertheless positive reply to a portion of June 3 letter, would serve to keep dialogue going, and might even lead to a valuable institution-building project if properly implemented and controlled. Doubt that Duvalier could get any political mileage out of it, especially if aid financing is indirect. Even if nothing came of exploratory discussions, useful time would have been gained.</p>
                                <p>(D) As regards Duvalierʼs request as it affects international institutions, both UNTA program and <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> either have in operation or are considering limited TA projects here with institution-building objectives. UN projects should continue, and I recommend that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Executive Director <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> be authorized approve four Haitian TA projects now under consideration. Additionally, however, to further <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> objectives spelled out above, there is room for some limited and carefully controlled international capital assistance to Haiti, similar to $2.3 million water supply loan granted GOH by <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> in 1964. Therefore recommend that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> indicate informally to <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> management that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would not oppose <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> working up a sound project for, say, further loan to IDAI (which already has $3.5 million line of credit from <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss>). (Perhaps some financing for Peligre electrification could be worked out within IDAI framework.) Such loan assistance would benefit Haitian economy long after Duvalier goes, and here again I doubt it would have any significantly negative political by-products in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> public opinion if way properly prepared. Water supply project seems going well under strict <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> control and not subject political exploitation by Duvalier.</p>
                                <p>(E) If <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> adopts line contained foregoing subparas, we could reply to Duvalier that bilaterally <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is prepared see if worthwhile specific project could be developed. Multilaterally, we could say that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> naturally prepared have <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> consider sound Haitian projects on merits. GOH already fully aware that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> holds absolute veto over <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> loans (Fund for Special Operations) to Haiti; thus if Haiti gets a small loan for IDAI GOH will know that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was determining factor, and this again would constitute very limited but positive reply to second aspect Duvalierʼs June 3 letter.</p>

                            <item>As regards form of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> reply to two letters, I recommend against substantive written reply, on ground that Duvalier might release it publicly or otherwise exploit. This leaves following alternatives: President, or Secretary on his behalf, could send brief generalized letter, saying President has taken note of views Duvalier expressed, etc. and that there are some matters which Amb <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName> will pursue with FonMin (this picks up note on which Secy/Chalmers Oct 8 talk ended), or I <pb n="808" xml:id="pg_808" facs="0843"/>could give oral reply to Chalmers along same line.

                        </list>
                        <p>Last June 3 and August 12 Duvalier sent the President letters asking, in effect, for renewal of U.S. economic assistance to Haiti (see attached <persName corresp="#p_RBH1">Read</persName>-to-<persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> memo).<note n="2" xml:id="d350fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> The August 12 letter contains highly offensive language charging that our Embassy (under Ambassador Thurston) and the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> worked with the Haitian armed forces to overthrow him.</p>
                        <p>After several months of delay on when and how the letters should be acknowledged, State has now suggested that the President send the brief, non-committal acknowledgement included in the attached memo.</p>
                        <p>The background to Stateʼs delay is important. From June to October they deliberately postponed answering the correspondence, first <pb n="809" xml:id="pg_809" facs="0844"/>because they were awaiting the more substantive August 12 letter and after that because of the problem of Duvalierʼs mood. During this period, Duvalier was making noises about PNGing Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName>. State wanted to string him along, making no commitments on assistance and avoiding giving him any pretext to act against the Embassy. In October, they decided that the situation was calm enough to reply. I advised <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>, in order to avoid the President getting involved in correspondence with Duvalier, to take advantage of his hospitalization to have Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reply on his behalf. They readily bought this, drafted a letter and sent it to the Seventh Floor for signature. In the Secretaryʼs absence, the reply went to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. He refused to sign it because it did not take issue with the objectionable paragraphs. Then <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Tom Mann</persName> got into the act and he decided that a Presidential reply is necessary to avoid antagonizing Duvalier. I checked back with Tom to see how strongly he felt about this. He is still of a mind that the President should send a non-committal acknowledgement along the lines of the one suggested, avoiding any reference to the objectionable paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>My view is that we should not put the President in the position of replying to Duvalier. One reason is the long delay in answering the correspondence. Another is that I prefer not to have the President corresponding with this petty tyrant. But much more important are the highly offensive paragraphs. I donʼt see how the President can send a letter ignoring the charges. And if he replies rejecting them, we run the serious risk of Duvalier reacting against our Embassy, which it is in our interest to prevent.</p>
                        <p>I think that the nature of Duvalierʼs charges and the language used are such that State could have declined to accept the August letter on delivery. If it had done so, however, it probably would have produced the Duvalier reaction that we wanted to avoid. But perhaps now the paragraphs offer an escape hatch.</p>
                        <p>I would recommend no written reply, either from here or from State. I would have Allan Stewart or <persName corresp="#p_VJH1">Jack Vaughn</persName> call in the Haitian Ambassador and tell him in very polite language that:

                                <item>the offensive paragraphs make it very difficult for us to reply formally without taking strong issue with the charges, which we, of course, do not accept;</item>

                                <item>because of this, we would prefer not to have to reply as we do not believe it would further relations between our two countries;</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>Our present contingency plans for Haiti are currently valid. The longer Duvalier remains in power, however, the less will be the potential influence of Haitian exiles. In a chaotic situation even several years hence, these exiles could provide some personnel for a provisional government, but forming a permanent stable government from exiles will be most difficult if Duvalier remains in power another year or more. To form the basis of a stable successor government, therefore, we will have to rely largely upon Haitians who remain in Haiti, including those presently in Duvalierʼs entourage.</p>
                        <pb n="811" xml:id="pg_811" facs="0846"/>
                        <p>Our review of the Haitian situation suggests a need to shift our tactics in an attempt to build some assets in Haiti. We believe this should be done indirectly through an expansion of U.S. voluntary agency programs, the Inter-American Bank, etc. A revised LAPC paper is being prepared.<note n="2" xml:id="d351fn2">See <ref target="#d352">Document 352</ref>.</note>

                        <p>If one or more members of Duvalierʼs regime prove unable to seize and hold power following Duvalierʼs departure from office, an extended period of anarchy and chaos is likely to result, inviting a Communist bid for power. In order to restore law and order no effective means other than intervention with U.S. military forces would be available to us unless by that time a permanent Inter-American Peace Force had been organized and made ready to function promptly. We doubt that an <gloss target="#t_IAPF1">IAPF</gloss> will be effective in time for a Haitian crisis and consequently the present contingency plans in this respect remain applicable.<note n="3" xml:id="d351fn3">A January 25 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_VJH1">Vaughn</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> reported that a new contingency plan for Haiti was being drafted.

                        </p>
                        <p>After declaring himself “president for life” in 1964 Duvalier has consolidated his control of Haiti by eliminating or terrorizing all actual and visible opposition to his rule.</p>
                        <pb n="812" xml:id="pg_812" facs="0847"/>
                        <p>Duvalier has not recently committed so many atrocities against Haitians and foreign residents of Haiti as he did earlier in his regime, probably because there is less identifiable opposition to him than in the past and because he wishes to improve his image abroad. Extortion, corruption, and brutality still characterize his government, however, and the general economic situation has reached new lows.</p>
                        <p>The Haitian Government has cooperated with the United States on issues arising in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, the UN and other international forums, but this is apparently based upon the hope of eliciting foreign economic assistance rather than an identification with U.S. objectives.</p>
                        <p>In July 1965 a group of Haitian exiles began broadcasting to Haiti in Creole from Station WRUL in New York City. Listener interest has been greater than anticipated and through the stationʼs efforts the Haitian people have performed a few acts demonstrating their opposition to Duvalier and support of the exile group but exposing the demonstrators to a minimum of retaliation. The exiles estimate, probably correctly, that Haitians believe the broadcasts are a prelude to a foreign-based operation to overthrow Duvalier, but if such an operation does not take place within six to nine months listener interest will decline and the latent non-marxist opposition within Haiti will disappear. The exiles also believe that if Duvalier remains in power another year few exiles will maintain an active interest in Haitian affairs and there will be no pro-West exile group capable of assuming power upon Duvalierʼs departure.</p>
                        <p>Haitian Communist parties are in complete disarray following Duvalierʼs arrest of a number of Haitian Communist leaders in July 1965 and the voluntary exile of others. Communist intellectual influence continues to increase, particularly among Haitian youths and intellectuals. There are unconfirmed reports of Communist training schools in the Cayes area, but it is unlikely that any significant amount of organized Communist activity can be conducted in Duvalierʼs police state.</p>
                        <p>In view of the weakness of opposition to Duvalier a successor regime will most likely be composed of one or more of Duvalierʼs lieutenants. If, however, Duvalierʼs lieutenants fight for power among themselves chaos could result which would invite a Communist bid for power.</p>
                        <p>Our Embassy at Port-au-Prince has been successful in avoiding clashes with the Duvalier regime and in executing its two-year-old mission of maintaining its presence and preventing the expulsion of its personnel. It has not been appreciably successful in influencing key elements of Haitian society except the press and the business, religious and diplomatic communities. As a result of Duvalierʼs pressure upon Haitians, United States personnel have limited contact with civilian <pb n="813" xml:id="pg_813" facs="0848"/>and military officials, youth, labor, peasants, students, teachers, intellectuals and other groups most likely to provide the future leadership of Haiti.</p>

                            <item>SIG Meeting: Haitian Contingency Paper</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The situation in Haiti has “stabilized” itself again after the plotting of three weeks ago. But conditions continue to be sufficiently unstable to make a sudden upheaval a possibility at any time. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName> is coming from Port-au-Prince today to give the SIG the latest estimate.</p>
                        <p>The contingency paper before the SIG is an incomplete and not very lucid draft.<note n="2" xml:id="d354fn2">
                                <ref target="#d353">Document 353</ref>.</note> The most important annexes (explained below) are missing. The paper itself was prepared according to a pre-determined standard format dictated by an IBM approach to problems and suffers from all the corresponding rigidities. My efforts to have papers tailored to individual country situations have foundered on bureaucratic requirements levied on <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> by higher authority.</p>
                        <p>The paperʼs principal value is that it identifies the various ways which the ball might bounce if Duvalier falls or a serious effort to dislodge him materializes. In trying to anticipate specific Latin American and Communist reactions to various contingencies and prescribe fixed courses of action, the paper is unrealistic, although there is some utility in at least thinking through the possibilities. What we do in a given situation will depend upon the circumstances prevailing at the time which may be quite different from those anticipated in the paper.</p>
                        <p>In the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> review of this paper, I insisted on the preparation of three annexes which should be kept up to date:
<list>
                                <label>a.</label>
                                <item>list of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> personnel with Haitian expertise who could be used in Haiti or Washington in a crisis situation.</item>
                                <label>b.</label>
                                <item>list of acceptable Haitians in Haiti or in exile whom we could tap to man a provisional government.</item>
                                <label>c.</label>
                                <item>list of immediate economic measures which we could take following the fall of Duvalier to quiet unrest, buttress the provisional government and get the economy moving again.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="826" xml:id="pg_826" facs="0861"/>
                        <p>As you and I discussed earlier, these three lists, plus the military contingency plans, are the guts of realistic planning in that they will enable us to act with maximum speed in any situation.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> agreed to include all three lists as annexes. They are in various stages of preparation but none ready to be included in the package which the SIG will consider tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that at the SIG you take this position:
<list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The SIG should take note of the paper as a useful planning document.<note n="3" xml:id="d354fn3">A Record of Agreements and Decisions of the SIG meeting of May 3 reported that the Group considered the draft contingency plans on Haiti and agreed that, if possible, the United States should avoid placing its forces in Haiti for any purpose other than rapid evacuation of U.S. and certain other citizens, and that the contingency plans should not be discussed with other members of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>.

                            <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Ellsworth Bunker</persName>, Bob Sayre and I met with Galo Plaza last Friday to have his impressions and recommendations on Haiti from where he had just come.<note n="3" xml:id="d355fn3">Telegrams 261, 262, and 263 from Port-au-Prince, all September 13, reported details of Galo Plazaʼs September 8–12 trip to Haiti. The first telegram reported on his meetings with Duvalier and Chalmers, and the latter two on his discussions with <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName> about Haitiʼs perilous political situation and the need for United States and <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> assistance. (All in National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 7 ECUADOR)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>His impressions were:
<list>
                                <item>—Duvalier is strongly entrenched with a highly personalized system of control and the chances of a palace coup or popular uprising are virtually nil.</item>
                                <item>—He might die from natural causes or assassination, in which case Haiti will be plunged into a blood bath because there is no institutional structure.</item>
                                <item>—The deterioration of the economy and the poverty and misery of the people is appalling.</item>
                                <item>—The unwillingness of the U.S. to pump more resources into Haiti is understandable but it really works to Duvalierʼs advantage since in the Haitian milieu he does better in isolation.</item>
                                <item>—The hemisphere for humanitarian reasons cannot stand idly by and permit the plight of the Haitian people to worsen because of Duvalier.</item>
                                <item>—The <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> cannot survive another U.S. unilateral intervention and we should get the Latin Americans thinking in terms of collective action <hi rend="italic">now</hi>.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Galo Plaza recommended that the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> furnish and administer through a special mission in Haiti assistance in the educational, agricultural and other fields. All activities would be under the direct <pb n="828" xml:id="pg_828" facs="0863"/>supervision of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> mission so that Duvalier and his henchmen could not get their hands in the till. He thought that under the guise of property watchmen the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> could put as many as 200 armed men into the country. The mission would constitute an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> presence which would facilitate <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> collective action when Duvalier goes and chaos follows. All of this would, of course, be subject to getting Duvalier to invite the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> in and accept <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> control conditions. He said he thought this possible and he would be willing to work on Duvalier to bring it about.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bunker Sayre</persName> and I reacted favorably to his proposal. I told Galo Plaza that I was not as sanguine as he on the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> aid presence facilitating <hi rend="italic">rapid</hi> political decision-making in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> for collective action to put forces in Haiti to avert bloodshed. I suggested an add-on to his proposal in the form of a prior understanding among the American governments (worked out informally on a foreign office-to-foreign office basis and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> through the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>) that when the lid blows in Haiti, the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> machinery will be brought into play immediately and the necessary decisions on collective action taken without delay. Galo Plaza thought this might be acceptable and in any event should be tried.</p>
                        <p>We indicated that his proposal would be carefully examined.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister Chalmers opened the conversation by referring to the recent meetings in Washington on August 22 and 23 between the Haitian Ambassador and representatives of <gloss target="#t_CIAP1">CIAP</gloss> and the State Department, at which it was announced Haiti was ineligible for Alliance for Progress Aid.<note n="2" xml:id="d356fn2">Telegrams 33460 and 33747 to Port-au-Prince, August 23, reported these meetings. (Both ibid., <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> (AFP) 3 ECOSOC-IA)</note> He then referred to a recent meeting in Portau-Prince attended by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TBEL1">Timmons</persName> and Chalmers and his Deputy at which various high officials of Haiti were accused of disturbing the good atmosphere of Haitian-American relationships. Chalmers stated that he had prepared a special Memorandum with relation to these problems with answers to the charges which he wished to present to the Secretary. (Memorandum being pouched separately.)<note n="3" xml:id="d356fn3">Not found.</note> Chalmers then went on to state that Haiti very badly needed help, particularly in connection with the development of infrastructure, such as roads and dams. However, Haitiʼs request for assistance had been denied, particularly the request with regard to the dam at Peligre (phonetic). The United States had, however, offered technical assistance on certain minor programs such as community development, rural education and birth control (as recorded, although Chalmers could have intended “malaria control”). Haiti was grateful for the aid in these minor areas. However, Haiti feared that the failure to receive help in basic development projects would mean that the already large gap between Haiti and the other Latin American countries would increase with the result that Haiti would eventually become a burden for the whole continent.</p>
                        <p>Chalmers then referred to the discussions last year with regard to a small loan from the <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> for social needs such as elementary schools. Though this was a minor program, even this had been blocked. Chalmers recalled the generous offer of help made by the Secretary last October 8 in conversation with Chalmers and Minister Dessinor. He recalled the Secretaryʼs statement of amazement that Haiti was still so poor although so close to a major market area, the United States.</p>
                        <p>Chalmers recounted a conversation he had had with ex-President Galo Plaza of Ecuador<note n="4" xml:id="d356fn4">Telegrams 261 and 262 from Port-au-Prince, September 13, reported this conversation. (Both National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 7 ECUADOR)</note> who had expressed the view that the great <pb n="830" xml:id="pg_830" facs="0865"/>powers must aid Haiti. The Secretary interjected to say that he recently had a conversation with Mr. Galo Plaza.<note n="5" xml:id="d356fn5">No record of this conversation has been found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Chalmers then stated that President Duvalier had agreed in order to obtain Alliance for Progress Aid to turn over (in French he said literally “abandon control of”) the management of approved projects to appropriate international agencies. Haiti will try this approach when next it comes to the United States for assistance. Haiti was prepared to turn over this delegation of authority to an international organization “for the period of capital amortization” (it is not too clear exactly what period of time Chalmers had in mind unless it was the time necessary to amortize the loan). Chalmers then went on to describe some negotiations the Haitian Government had had two years ago with General Electric Corporation which was about ready to agree to the project if it could itself take over the management of the Berique Dam project. Haiti wished to start again its negotiations with General Electric and carry them through to fruition. Haitiʼs intention was that the management of the project would be turned over to General Electric in order to obtain agreement. Chalmers realized this was a private not a government project but he wished to inform the Secretary of Haitiʼs intent to renew these discussions.</p>
                        <p>Chalmers then referred to the population explosion in Haiti which he estimated would result in an increase in population from 4.5 million to 8 or 9 million by 1980. If the Haitian Government did not do something such as complete the Peligre Dam project which would help raise the subsistence level, it would have a terrible problem on its hands.</p>
                        <p>Chalmers then went into a discussion of the situation of an unnamed Western European country whose policies (presumably political and social) the United States did not like and to which it had accordingly refused aid. When the United States changed its outlook towards this country, and the country received aid, it began to make progress in every area and “even liberalized its government”. Yet this government, he pointed out, had been one of the most backward. (Chalmers never did define which government he meant but the implication of a comparison with Haiti was clear.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then replied by recalling his personal esteem for Foreign Minister Chalmers and asked whether he might speak freely, saying he would leave it to Chalmers how much he would tell his government. When Chalmers expressed the hope that the Secretary would so speak, the Secretary stated he was very much interested in the possibility that Haiti might accept the concept of independent management <pb n="831" xml:id="pg_831" facs="0866"/>for some <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> projects. He said he had discussed the Haitian problem personally with other Latin American Foreign Ministers, all of whom were concerned with the development gap between Haiti and the other countries of the hemisphere. (Chalmers here interjected that “it was not a gap but an abyss”.) The Secretary continued, saying that if he might he would like to speak bluntly: “The position of the Haitian people was a scandal and a problem in the hemisphere”. He considered that Haiti presented a problem as urgent as any in the hemisphere including Cuba. The concern of both the Secretary and his colleagues was how the United States or the Latin American countries might move to improve the situation. The Secretary said he did not want to embarrass the Foreign Minister but there existed, in fact, a disposition to help the Haitian people if we, and others, could be assured that the people themselves would be the recipients of the aid. There had been some unhappy experiences in the past. Chalmers indicated he would like to discuss this point. The Secretary then reiterated the deep concern in the hemisphere, and he used the term hemisphere to include institutions as well as governments, with the situation of the Haitian people, a preoccupation with raising their standard of living and of education. For example, said the Secretary, the governments of Chile, Mexico and Venezuela were deeply concerned about doing something for the Haitian people. They wished to help in such a way as not to run into political difficulties and not to be hampered in their efforts. There was no intent, however, that in working with the people they would engage in plots or conspiracies. Chalmers acknowledged his certainty that the United States had no such intent. The Secretary again repeated his desire to find some way to be sure all the efforts would go to the Haitian people.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred back to the Memorandum presented to him by Chalmers, saying that he would study it carefully. He expressed the hope that whatever might be done for the people could be insulated from political considerations to be sure that the people themselves might benefit.</p>
                        <p>Chalmers replied that he would report all of this to his government “which will not find shocking the proposal that some programs of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> should not be managed by the Haitian Government”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that Haiti caused him to lose a great deal of sleep pointing out it was not only the difficulties in Haiti but also the difficulties with various organs of the United States Government which were bothered about the Haitian problem.</p>
                        <p>Chalmers then asked whether he might write personally to the Secretary on some of these matters. The Secretary replied in the affirmative but urged that Chalmers use the “utmost discretion” in the interests of both of them. The Secretary repeated how much he valued <pb n="832" xml:id="pg_832" facs="0867"/>his contacts with Chalmers, contacts which he wished to continue. Therefore, he wished no events to occur which might interrupt this contact. He then expressed his high opinion of Chalmersʼ competence as a Foreign Minister. To this Chalmers replied that a Foreign Minister “sits on the outside”. The Secretary replied that nevertheless some foreign ministers earn their pay.</p>
                        <p>Chalmers left thanking the Secretary sincerely for his consideration and leaving with him a Note and a Memorandum.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Ministerʼs Note transmitted:

                            <p rend="center">HAITIAN SITUATION</p>
                            <p>Duvalier continues to maintain an iron grip on Haiti. The surface appearance that he has ameliorated the ruthlessness of his regime is misleading—he has physically eliminated the opposition or driven it from the country and for the time being no one is opposing him.</p>
                            <p>The general economic and social situation continues to deteriorate. Although Haiti has maintained a reasonably sound financial situation, there has been no significant new investment in the country. Successive hurricane disasters over the last several years have also adversely affected the Haitian economy. Preliminary reports on the damage done by Hurricane Inez indicates that it has not been too serious. We are providing emergency relief.</p>
                            <p>Our ability to assist Haiti is limited. We terminated our bilateral economic programs in 1963 when it became obvious that Duvalier would not permit <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> to operate except under his political control. We have continued minimal indirect assistance ($3.3 million in FY 66) through multilateral and United States voluntary agencies.</p>
                            <p>We have followed basically two objectives with regard to Haiti: (1) assisting the Haitian people as much as possible without giving direct assistance to Duvalier and (2) establishing a greater international presence in Haiti and a greater awareness among the American Republics of the situation there in case contingencies should arise which would require action by the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> or U.S.</p>
                            <p>We have tried to increase assistance through third agencies to the extent we have considered possible without assuming unacceptable political liabilities. We have urged Chile, Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia to give technical assistance. Israel and the Republic of China are considering small technical assistance projects if ways can be found to cover the dollar costs.</p>
                            <pb n="834" xml:id="pg_834" facs="0869"/>
                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> is considering a $1.3 million project to improve Haitiʼs education facilities. The loan has the approval of all of the Latin members of the <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> Board. The project is stalled because Treasury is reluctant to vote for the project in the <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> at the same time <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is unwilling to provide assistance on a bilateral scale. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> has discussed this loan with Secretary Fowler. I have asked State for a memo so we can get this impasse resolved.<note n="3" xml:id="d357fn3">
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>ʼs October 14 memorandum to the President requesting approval of his loan argued that multilateral assistance was a good way of getting aid to the people of Haiti without providing political benefit to Duvalier. The approval line of the memorandum is checked. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File, Haiti, Vol. IV)</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>Dr. Galo Plaza Lasso, ex-President of Ecuador, recently visited Haiti and has proposed an enlarged program of technical assistance and some capital development for Haiti to be conducted by the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> under strict controls. Duvalier indicated to Galo Plaza, and his Foreign Minister stated to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, that Haiti would accept international control of the program. The Galo Plaza plan anticipates a large <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> presence in Haiti to be available when a major political crisis occurs. State is staffing out this proposal and will be making recommendations on it in the near future.</p>
                            <p>State, Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> have prepared a comprehensive contingency plan for Haiti.<note n="4" xml:id="d357fn4">See <ref target="#d353">Document 353</ref>.</note> It considers all currently anticipated contingencies, including the employment of United States forces to evacuate Americans and other foreign nationals from Haiti. It includes up-to-date lists of acceptable Haitians inside and outside Haiti who could be used in forming a new government and of U.S. civilian and military personnel with Haitian experience who could be mobilized to work in Haiti as we had to do during the early days of the Dominican crisis.</p>
                            <p>We are also consulting on a regular basis with the large American countries about conditions in Haiti, but we have not discussed specific contingencies or possible United States and <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> reactions because such discussions would inevitably become public knowledge.</p>

                        <list>
                            <label>A.</label>
                            <item>Duvalierʼs position still seems fairly strong, despite the sporadic plotting and political tension normal in Haitian affairs. We think the chances are better than even that he will remain in power during the period of this estimate. If he does, there will be continuing political repression and economic stagnation or decline.</item>
                            <label>B.</label>
                            <item>Duvalierʼs overthrow would probably have to be largely an inside job, with some key members of the security forces—and especially the Presidential Guard—participating. We doubt that any now in a position to organize such a coup has the will or the courage to attempt it. None of the many small groupings among the divided, bickering Haitian exiles could succeed in overthrowing Duvalier without decisive help from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or some other foreign government. The Haitian dictator might, of course, die suddenly of natural causes, though he is only 59 and in reasonably good health; assassination is also a possibility, though he takes unusual precautions.</item>
                            <label>C.</label>
                            <item>Duvalierʼs departure would probably be attended by some acts of violence in Port-au-Prince and other towns. Whether this violence was limited and sporadic or became widespread and intensive would depend in large part on the manner of his going. The danger of widespread hostilities would probably be greatest in the event Duvalier were assassinated in public. A coup attempt that failed at the last minute could produce equally nasty results.</item>
                            <label>D.</label>
                            <item>The most likely successor to Duvalier would be a military junta which might or might not choose to exercise power behind a civilian <pb n="836" xml:id="pg_836" facs="0871"/>front. Initially at least, such a government would probably not be stable, and there would likely be maneuvering for power among its members.</item>
                            <label>E.</label>
                            <item>The two Communist parties are too small and weak to be able to contend for power even in a disorderly situation following Duvalierʼs departure. We doubt that outside Communist support—from Castro, the Soviets, or Haitian Communist exiles—would be forthcoming on a Significant scale. We believe that the Haitian Communists themselves would see their best chance of gaining influence as coming through offers of their administrative assistance to new government leadership rather than through any attempt to seize power on their own, and we think they would act accordingly.</item>
                            <label>F.</label>
                            <item>In a situation where order had completely broken down, the Organization of American States (<gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>) would almost certainly acquiesce in action by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to evacuate foreign nationals. Any proposal for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> intervention to restore order and establish an effective government, however, would encounter strong opposition within the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. Any contention that such intervention was necessary in order to forestall a Communist takeover would be disbelieved by many <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> members unless the supporting evidence was incontrovertible. Whatever the purpose for intervening, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would face considerable criticism internationally.</item>
                            <label>G.</label>
                            <item>The initial Haitian reaction to the landing of a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> force would probably be favorable, but if a military occupation were at all prolonged, opposition would develop. Nevertheless, the problems in Haiti are such that it might prove more difficult to get a force out than to put it in, as was the case in 1915.</item>

                        <p>In November 1966 rumors began to circulate in Haiti and in Miami, Florida, that an invasion of Haiti was imminent, with Miami and the Dominican Republic mentioned as staging areas. In a November 11 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to the President, also sent as an unnumbered telegram to the LBJ Ranch, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> reported that there was no “hard information of any muscle” behind impending coup plans but that officials of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Departments of Defense and State were meeting that morning to review contingency plans and ensure that “the Caribbean Amphibious Force is in position to react promptly in case of need.” (Johnson Library, National <pb n="837" xml:id="pg_837" facs="0872"/>Security File, Country File, Haiti, Vol. IV) <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> reported to the President the following day that Duvalier had dismissed or retired 17 Haitian military officers without first arresting them, indicating that the dictator was “sure of his ground.” (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>A November 14 memorandum from the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, sent by telegram to the President, the Secretary of State, and the Directors of Central Intelligence and Defense Intelligence among others, reported that Rolando Masferrer, an exiled former Cuban senator, had organized an invasion force in the Miami area to overthrow Duvalier, and was attempting to charter a boat capable of carrying 300 men. (Ibid.) In a November 17 note to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> reported that he had relayed the substance of the FBI memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_SRM1">Sayre</persName>, who reassured him that the enforcement agencies had their own people inside the ranks of the expeditionary group and would “move against Masferrer when the time is right.” (Ibid.) Telegram 88010 to Santo Domingo and Port-au-Prince, November 18, reported that a Department officer had told the Haitian Chargé that “the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would not permit such activities on its soil” and authorized the Ambassador to so inform Foreign Minister Chalmers. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–7 HAI)</p>
                        <p>Telegram 1914 from Santo Domingo, December 16, reported <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName>ʼ discussion with President <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> the previous day. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Crimmins</persName> said that U.S. policy toward Duvalier was essentially passive, stating that “we are neither helping him stay in office nor in any way abetting his overthrow.” <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> replied that he “in effect could not care less about Duvalier and Haiti.” Concerning invasion activity, <persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Balaguer</persName> said that Haitians and Cubans were still preparing plans, bases, and supplies in the Dominican Republic, but that the Dominican military had raided their Manzanillo camp, seized their arms cache, and were deporting three Cuban “no-good adventurers.” (Ibid., POL 23–9 HAI) Telegrams 111362 and 112102 to Port-au-Prince, January 3 and 4, 1967, reported that U.S. Customs Service agents arrested 75 persons from Masferrerʼs group during the night of January 2, seized two boats, arms, and ammunition.

                        </p>
                        <p>This contingency plan for Haiti conceives of two categories of contingencies: (1) Duvalier falls from power and unacceptable Haitians achieve dominance; and (2) Duvalier remains in office but Communists or other unacceptable Haitians mount a potentially successful operation to overthrow him.</p>
                        <p>An external attack on Haiti involving a few guerrillas could occur without detection or interception by the United States and therefore might be in a position to succeed before we are able to react. Similarly, the overthrow of Duvalier and his replacement by an unacceptable successor could occur without giving us needed reaction time.</p>
                        <p>Very little military force is needed to take the capital and no other single city or area is necessary to control the existing governmental organizations of Haiti. The introduction of even a small military force in Port-au-Prince would therefore be a major, if not decisive, influence on the crisis situation. The employment of a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military force is contemplated to prevent a Communist government from controlling Haiti and, if necessary, to evacuate American and other foreign nationals whose lives are threatened.</p>
                        <p>Duvalierʼs successor will probably seek our military and/or economic assistance to stabilize his regime, but withholding that assistance would not necessarily insure his downfall.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is the contingency plan, proposing U.S. options in response to “unacceptable” successors to Duvalier in Haiti and nine annexes.]</p>

                            <item>Although it is true, as it has been for some years, that Duvalier could be overthrown at any moment, the political situation has not become more tense nor has it further deteriorated. There is little evidence that there has been any active plotting or that any group could form to carry off a coup without detection and ruthless annihilation. If anything, Duvalier has strengthened his position by his recent display of life-and-death control over each and every Haitian, innocent or guilty. His closest associates have remained loyal and have carried out his orders blindly, even though they must know their lives are in jeopardy. Intelligent Haitian observers say that this incredible subservience and shortsightedness is to be expected from the men close to Duvalier. He has so thoroughly involved them in his own crimes and, at the same time, so enriched them that they will cling to their prerogatives. They are unwilling to take any preventive action whereby they might lose everything, and hope to be able to save their own lives by seeking asylum at the last fatal minute. They feel they have more to fear from a future unknown regime.</item>

There has been no doubt for some years that Duvalier is not normal. His speech on 22 June 1967 showed definite signs of paranoia. In his fear of his enemies, imagined or real, he believes any denunciation and would take wide-range repressive action if any unsuccessful attempt were made against his life. Despite his fears, he remains in full control of his faculties and the instrument of government. Lacking real targets, he simply has removed all threats to his power: his son-in-law, his close past associates, his bodyguards, and most recently, members of his own cabinet.</item>

                            <item>The economic situation continues to worsen. Drought conditions in the cul-de-sac may lessen the sugar crop. The coffee and sisal markets offer little hope for the Haitian economy. Duvalierʼs monetary situation is shaky as revenues continue to decline. In the face of these seemingly insurmountable obstacles, it appears that Duvalierʼs family has urged him to abdicate. However, there is little chance that he will, and he is likely to retain his political power while further injuring the national economy through foolish acts. Most recently, he has threatened the continued existence of the Commercial Bank by depriving its president, Clemard Joseph Charles, of much of his empire. This will be a serious blow to free enterprise and continued business operations, let alone development.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>Duvalierʼs control is total. There is no “power balance” in the palace. Duvalier plays off his militia against the army and vice versa, and he has never permitted anyone to become a threat to his own power. All opposition, or imagined opposition, is ruthlessly and bloodily crushed. Least likely to succeed in the near future are the Communists who are too small in numbers to carry through any move. Someday someone may muster up enough courage to kill Duvalier. It would not be difficult; however, then the first scramble for power would come among the top Duvalierist hierarchy which would still hold the symbols and some of the seats of power, as well as the only weapons. The army is the most likely force to seize control if Duvalier should go. A military regime would not last long and successor governments would, without outside help, continue to deteriorate and lose more and more control. In this atmosphere, the Communists will have an opportunity for insurgency; the danger, however, is not immediate.</p>

                        <p>On September 16, 1966, at the request of Joseph E. Johnson, President, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, you received Galo Plaza who proposed an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> “plan” for Haiti. Quiet discussions on this topic were held between departmental officers and officials of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CIAP1">CIAP</gloss> in the ensuing months and a general program, a substantial refinement of Plazaʼs plan, was developed. The SIG, on July 27, 1967, “agreed to give political support, and financial support as required … for the purpose of providing Latin American technical assistance to Haiti … provided … qualified French-speaking Latin Americans can be found and recruited.”<note n="2" xml:id="d365fn2">

                        <p>Bill <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> met this afternoon with representatives of State, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> to review the bidding on the Haitian situation.</p>
                        <p>The intelligence community has not been able to come up with a clear picture of what is going on at Cap Haitien. A landing of some nature did take place, but we have not been able to determine the size of the invasion force. The figure of 50–75 men is the one most frequently heard, but the reports of the aircraft used could not have lifted this many. Reports on the fighting vary with the source. The invaders claim progress. Duvalier says they have been contained and will shortly be liquidated. The latest report from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RCG1">Ross</persName> is that everything appears normal and outwardly calm in Port-au-Prince. He has nothing on the situation in the north.<note n="2" xml:id="d366fn2">Not further identified. In a later telegram <persName corresp="#p_RCG1">Ross</persName> reported on a meeting with Acting Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Raymond</persName>, who stated that forces under the leadership of Haitians based in the United States had bombed Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien and “landed mercenaries” near the latter area during the morning of the previous day. <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Raymond</persName> asked the U.S. Government to investigate and interdict any illegal acts of Haitians based in the United States. <persName corresp="#p_RCG1">Ross</persName> replied that the first news that both the Department and he had received about the invasion had come from Haitian Ambassador Arthur Bonhomme in Washington.

This would serve to give the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> a basis for preempting collective action in the event the Haitians try to involve <pb n="847" xml:id="pg_847" facs="0882"/>the UN.<note n="4" xml:id="d366fn4">Telegram 5286 from USUN, May 22, reported that the Haitian representative had delivered a letter to the President of the Security Council requesting that the Council be convened so that “appropriate measures” could be taken to reduce the “state of tension which threatens peace,” but that he had no date in mind for such a session. (Ibid., POL 23–9 HAI/UN) Telegram 169444 to USUN, May 23, responded that the U.S. Mission should discuss the complaint with the Brazilian Security Council representative and seek to have him dissuade the Haitians from pressing for a meeting. (Ibid., POL 23–9 HAI)</note> Galo Plaza had lunch with U Thant today. We do not know whether they discussed Haiti, and the roles of their respective organizations.</item>

                        <p>Following a meeting with Haitian Ambassador Bonhomme on May 24, 1968, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Katzenbach</persName> sent a memorandum to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> recommending that he receive Bonhomme, at the latterʼs request. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Katzenbach</persName> wrote that difficulties in the United Nations could be avoided if the President could convince the Ambassador that there was no basis for the Haitian allegations against the United States, “and that if Haiti persists it will be damaging to U.S.-Haiti relations.” A notation in the Presidentʼs handwriting next to the approved option reads: “10 minutes.” (National Archives and Records Administration, Central Files 1967–69, POL HAI-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>A May 24 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to the President concurring with <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Katzenbach</persName>ʼs recommendation that the President receive Bonhomme, stated that “Nickʼs disclaimer that ʼthere is no basis for Haitian allegations against the U.S.,ʼ may be overstated” and that news reports suggested “that the B–25 used in the expedition may well have come from the United States [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>].” (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File, Haiti, Vol. V)</p>
                        <p>A May 27 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Katzenbach</persName> to the President reported that the United Nations Security Council was scheduled to meet at 4 p.m. that afternoon in response to Haitiʼs request that “appropriate measures” be taken to reduce tension that it alleged threatened international peace and security. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Katzenbach</persName> noted that Haiti had not made clear what action it expected and that Security Council members were generally unenthusiastic about considering this matter. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, POL HAI-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>Telegram 5352 from USUN, May 27, reported Bonhommeʼs “long presentation” before the Security Council, in which he presented 22 exhibits linking the invasion aircraft to the United States, but did not actually name or accuse the United States as being involved in the invasion. The Brazilian representative then intervened to note that the Haitian charges were vague and were best handled in other ways. The U.S. representative expressed regrets to the Haitian representative that the latter “had not been more forthcoming in bilateral channels.” (Ibid., POL 23–9 HAI/UN)</p>
                        <p>Telegram 195334 to Port-au-Prince, July 2, reported that the Haitian and U.S. Governments were cooperating in connection with the investigation of “invasion facts.” (Ibid., POL 17 HAI-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>)</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Bonhomme opened the conversation by saying he had come at the express direction of President Duvalier. He then made an indirect criticism of the State Department for the delay in getting the appointment,<note n="2" xml:id="d369fn2">Telegram 170497 to Port-au-Prince, May 24, reported Ambassador Bonhommeʼs meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Katzenbach</persName> that day during which Bonhomme said he had instructions to give President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> a message from Duvalier. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Katzenbach</persName> asked for the “facts” of U.S. involvement in the bombing and invasion. When Bonhomme “went on in typical rambling fashion” about the operation being launched from the Bahamas, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Katzenbach</persName> observed that this meant that the Haitian Government did not think the attack had come from the United States. Bonhomme replied to both issues that the “facts are for the Security Council, not for you.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, POL HAI-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>)</note> noting that he had asked for it one hour after the landings at Cap Haitien but had been referred to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador made protestations of Duvalierʼs high regard for the President. He referred to the President having “loosened the strangulation” of Haiti. To illustrate the point, he referred to the education loan granted by the IADB.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Bonhomme then recited general complaints about exile activities against Duvalier. He said most of the action was in the United States, but it also goes on in Curacao, the Bahamas and Europe. The State Department was aware of all this. He admitted that six months ago, an expedition had been stopped in Miami by U.S. authorities, but the plotting continued. The implication here was that the State Department was not cracking down as hard as it could.</p>
                        <p>On the Cap Haitien incident, he claimed his Government had facts that U.S. aircraft flown by U.S. pilots and other U.S. military equipment had been used in the invasion. He noted that Haitian exiles, prior to and after the invasion broadcast programs from the U.S. calling for the overthrow of Duvalier. He added his government had tapes. He said there is evidence of Castro Cuban involvement and made a murky <pb n="850" xml:id="pg_850" facs="0885"/>reference to the possibility of another missile crisis over Haiti if exiles, with Cuban support, were to succeed, as Castro had done with his twelve followers.</p>
                        <p>During this part of the conversation, the President interrupted to say he was not aware of any evidence of U.S. involvement. He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> if they had such information. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> noted we had asked the Ambassador and his government for such evidence, but so far it has not been forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>Referring to Haitiʼs request for UN Security Council action, Ambassador Bonhomme said Duvalier had given him instructions not to attack the United States. He would present evidence on the equipment used by the Haitian exiles and from whence they came. He admitted that the Cap Haitien invasion had been staged from the Bahamas and not from U.S. territory. He was vague on the action he would ask of the Security Council, saying the UN could recommend that states prevent the type of activities which have been directed against Haiti.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> if they had any comments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName> pointed out that Haiti, in going directly to the UN Security Council, had by-passed the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>—the body to which it should have gone with its evidence and complaint. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Bowdler</persName> recalled that when we had hard evidence last year on the Miami-based invasion, we stopped it cold and got convictions. In this complaint, the Haitians say they have evidence, but have not given it to us; and we cannot act except on the basis of facts.</p>
                        <p>In closing, the President told the Ambassador he could not tell President Duvalier what to do, but it was regrettable that he had not brought his complaints to the body where we handle hemisphere differences. He reminded the Ambassador that we can act only on the basis of solid evidence, and the quicker it is furnished, the quicker we will be able to assess it and act accordingly.</p>

                        <p>During the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration, the U.S. Government continued the <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> administrationʼs policy of working with the British Government to offer encouragement and support to the pro-West leaders and political organizations of British Guiana as that limited self-governing colony moved toward total independence. The Special Group/303 Committee approved approximately $2.08 million for covert action programs between 1962 and 1968 in that country.</p>
                        <p>U.S. policy included covert opposition to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName>, the then pro-Marxist leader of British Guianaʼs East Indian population. A portion of the funds authorized by the Special Group/303 Committee for covert action programs was used between November 1962 and June 1963 to improve the election prospects of the opposition political parties to the government of <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs Peopleʼs Progressive Party. The U.S. Government successfully urged the British to impose a system of proportional representation in British Guiana (which favored the anti-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> forces) and to delay independence until the anti-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> forces could be strengthened. Through the Central Intelligence Agency, the United States provided Forbes <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName>ʼs political parties, which were in opposition to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>, with both money and campaign expertise as they prepared to contest the December 1964 parliamentary elections. The U.S. Governmentʼs covert funding and technical expertise were designed to play a decisive role in the registration of voters likely to vote against <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>ʼs supporters were registered in large numbers, helping to elect an anti-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> coalition.</p>
                        <p>Special Group/303 Committee-approved funds again were used between July 1963 and April 1964 in connection with the 1964 general strike in British Guiana. When <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs and <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs supporters clashed in labor strife in the sugar plantations that year, the United States joined with the British Government in urging <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> not to retaliate with violence, but rather to commit to a mediated end to the conflict. At the same time, the United States provided training to certain of the anti-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> forces to enable them to defend themselves if attacked and to boost their morale.</p>
                        <p>Following the general strike, 303 Committee-approved funds were used to support the election of a coalition of <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs Peopleʼs National Congress and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>ʼs United Force. After <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> was elected Premier in December 1964, the U.S. Government, again through the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, continued to provide substantial funds to both <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> and their parties. In 1967 and 1968, 303 Committee-approved <pb n="852" xml:id="pg_852" facs="0887"/>funds were used to help the <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> coalition contest and win the December 1968 general elections. When the U.S. Government learned that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> was going to use fraudulent absentee ballots to continue in power in the 1968 elections, it advised him against such a course of action, but did not try to stop him.</p>

                            <p>In a letter of July 18, 1963, to President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName> from Prime Minister Macmillan<note n="4" xml:id="d371fn4">A copy is in the National Archives, RG 59, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204, UK/Macmillan.</note> the British advised us of their decision “… to impose a system of proportional representation without a referendum and then to hold elections under a new system”. This letter also informed us of a British expectation to “renew direct rule for a period of six months to a year while a new constitution is introduced and new elections held under it”. The latter assertion was made on a British assumption that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> would resign when informed of the new electoral system at a Constitutional Conference held October 22–31. He did not do so, but has repeatedly stated that he does not feel bound to accept the British decisions.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> seems uncertain and a little desperate but he is unlikely to resign voluntarily. No occasion has yet arisen to show whether he will obstruct the carrying out of the decisions but probably he will try to hang on, temporizing and avoiding flagrantly illegal acts. His regime has been organizing a protest march on Georgetown as well as secretly promoting a rash of arson in the countryside. The regime is likely to try to foster an atmosphere of intimidation and potential terror in an effort to attract international attention and more particularly to discourage opponents of the regime.</p>
                            <p>While the UK agrees as to the importance of getting rid of <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>, it is reluctant to impose direct rule unless <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs actions so clearly call for such a course as to pose no presentational problems for the UK. In addition, the UK tends to put somewhat less weight than we do on the advantages of such a step. The UK believes that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> would pose as a martyr and could be more dangerous in opposition than as Premier.</p>
                            <p>In view of the above circumstances, we think it desirable that the UK increase security and interpret its reserved powers in the foreign affairs field broadly in order to frustrate communist aid to the <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> regime.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPG1">Gordon Walker</persName> what he thought about British Guiana. <persName corresp="#p_WPG1">Gordon Walker</persName> replied that he knew Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> was thinking of an article which appeared in <hi rend="italic">The Reporter</hi> on February 13 which purported to represent <persName corresp="#p_WPG1">Gordon Walker</persName>ʼs views. Since the article had come out, he had been giving considerable thought as to what he had really said to the man who had written the article. To the best of his recollection, he had made the following points which, he emphasized, were his own views which had not been fully checked out with the Labor Party:
<list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>It makes the Labor Party uncomfortable not to grant independence to any country when the situation is ripe.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>He recognized the primacy of U.S. interests in British Guiana.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Labor believed there would be social revolutions in Latin America. Some of these would be ugly ones which would not fit in with the pattern of the Alliance for Progress. Some Nasser-type governments would undoubtedly emerge.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Labor would like to find a way to give independence to British Guiana without affronting or injuring the U.S. Britain of course cannot afford to appear as an agent of the U.S. The way in which the <persName corresp="#p_DSA1">Douglas-Home</persName> government was trying to do this was completely unacceptable to the people of British Guiana because it makes the entire country into one constituency. Some other form of proportional representation<note n="2" xml:id="d373fn">At a Constitutional Conference in London in October 1963, the major British Guiana party leaders asked British Colonial Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> to devise a constitution, “since they were unable to agree among themselves.” <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> then decreed a new registration and general election under proportional representation for a single house legislature. “<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> was furious at being outsmarted.” (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_CWB1">Cobb</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, September 15, 1965, Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INRIL1">INR/IL</gloss> Historical Files, British Guiana White House Meetings)</note> might well be considered by Labor.</item>

                        <p>There was a discussion of the menace represented by <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> said we were seriously concerned with the way <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> conducted himself. We could not live with a Castro-type government on the South American continent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPG1">Gordon Walker</persName> thought the U.S. exaggerated the menace of <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>. There was a limit to what he could do, in view of the racial division in British Guiana; for example, he could hardly have complete control in a situation where the capital of the country was against him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> added that we were worried about the Castro aspects–that British Guiana would be used as a base for subversion on the continent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPG1">Gordon Walker</persName> replied that a bit of this sort of thing was bound to develop in Latin America. However, if a way could be found for the U.S. to put its troops into British Guiana, the Labor Party would not object. Britain did not want to keep its troops there indefinitely. Britain had no real reason of its own to stay. Furthermore, its troops were spread too thin. One battalion now in British Guiana was not enough.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In an effort to prevent the holding of a UK-imposed proportional representation election, expected to be held late this year, the <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> regime has been resorting to intimidation and violence. What began some 12 weeks ago as a strike by the pro-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> sugar workersʼ union has developed into a campaign of beatings, bombings, and arson in which 19 persons have been killed and more than a million dollarsʼ worth of property and sugar cane have been burned. This violence has exacerbated the racial tensions between the majority East Indians and the minority Negroes to such an extent that some officials fear that the situation may get out of hand.</p>
                        <p>Contributing to this concern has been the agitation of activists in the <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> regime, who have attacked not only members of the competing sugar workersʼ union but also the opposition parties, which are composed mainly of Negroes and other non-Indians. Local police have uncovered arms buried by members of <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs youth organization. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>As the proportional representation election which threatens to oust him from office draws nearer-registration began on May 8–<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs despair is deepening. In the hope that the election may be postponed, he has invited Prime Minister <persName>Williams</persName> of Trinidad to try to mediate the differences between him and the leaders of the opposition parties. It seems unlikely, however, that the opposition parties, hopeful of victory in a proportional representation election, will agree to <persName>Williams</persName>ʼ proposals. As the <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> regime grows more desperate, its extremist elements may well be tempted to undertake more ambitious acts of terrorism. Such acts could provoke the threatened Negro minority into large-scale retaliation.</p>

<list>
                                    <item>“a. Our principal objective is to defeat the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> in the forthcoming elections and to bring into power a coalition government of the Peopleʼs National Congress, the United Force, and alternative East Indian party(ies), headed by Linden Forbes <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>. While retaining tactical flexibility, all our moves must be directed at attainment of this objective.</item>
                                    <item>“b. We believe that in terms of accomplishing our objective things at this time are going well despite the current wave of violence. Registration of voters to date and the increasing nervousness of the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> support this assessment.</item>
                                    <item>“c. Therefore, we should make every effort to adhere to the present schedule, i.e., elections under proportional representation in early November, and to avoid being deflected from our present course. The <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> is clearly making every effort to upset this schedule.</item>
                                    <item>“d. We believe that resumption of direct British rule at this stage would impede the attainment of our objective. Resumption could delay elections, make it easier for the British Labour Party, if it comes to power, to tamper with <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName>ʼ decision, and give the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> additional campaign issues.</item>
                                    <item>“e. We share the view of the Governor that the declaration of a state of emergency probably will be required to cope with the security situation. The British may have to buttress the declaration by dispatching additional troops to British Guiana. We see advantages in the declaration resulting from ʼadviceʼ of the Ministers. If ʼadviceʼ from the Ministers is not forthcoming,<note n="5" xml:id="d378fn5">In telegram 298 to Georgetown, May 22, the Department reported that the British Embassy in Washington had informed it that, under pressure from the Governor and the Commissioner of Police, <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> had notified the Governor that he would “advise” the Governor to declare a state of emergency on May 22 or 23. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 23–8 BR GU)</note> declaration by a special Order in Council may well be necessary.</item>
                                    <item>“f. Tactically we would prefer to allow HMG on its own initiative, without urgings by the U.S., to arrive at the conclusion that a declaration of emergency and probably the dispatch of additional troops are required.</item>
                                    <item>“g. We agree with your reasons that it would be disadvantageous for the <gloss target="#t_MPCA1">MPCA</gloss> to consent to co-operate with the committee to investigate the sugar dispute, which is obviously stacked in favor of the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>. We also agree that Ishmael is not likely to co-operate. In discussions locally you should continue to take the position that Ishmael should be allowed to make his own decision.</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>We were received by Premier <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> in his darkened, air-conditioned office. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> explained that because of astigmatism his eyes suffered from the intense glare and therefore he was more comfortable in a dim office.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> said he was most discouraged about the situation in British Guiana. The efforts of the sugar workers to throw off the burden of the company union had led to tension in the community and racial animosities had been aroused. He did not know what would happen now. The struggle against the company union, and the BGTUC is nothing but a company union nowadays, should be resolved and he had appointed a committee to try to resolve it but only the sugar workers were willing to cooperate.</p>
                        <p>On the political scene he was also discouraged. The British Government had imposed <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> although it was admittedly a most unsatisfactory voting method and he wondered what it might lead to. The British had pushed him around since he first organized the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> and had changed the system on him time and again gerrymandering districts, changing the number of districts, and now even <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>. It was most discouraging and Indian voters might well become disenchanted with <pb n="864" xml:id="pg_864" facs="0899"/>the so-called parliamentary system of democracy and turn elsewhere if the Guiana experience was any example. Perhaps it was a result of the cold war tensions but parliamentarianism and democracy seemed on the way out. In Latin America for example there are many more dictatorships today than ever before since World War II.</p>
                        <p>“No matter what I try to do,” <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> said, “I can get no where. I am opposed by everyone, including the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> which I suppose is the American Government. I laid my cards on the table to President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName>, and he gave me to understand that he would help me but he didnʼt and I can only conclude that he was a liar or that he was influenced to change his decision. The people in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> know that I am trying to help them. They are not dumb. But they see that I am being frustrated by every turn. When I see newspaper correspondents they distort what I tell them.

                                <item>The present unrest in British Guiana is still a long way from being serious. Only a few people have been hurt and the British response has been and has needed to be only a moderate one. The unrest, in part, is a sign that we are on the right track; <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName> and/or his people are beginning to feel that they are on their way out and are stirring up trouble in the hope that they can reverse the trend.

                            <item>On 3 June 1964 <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Linden Forbes Burnham</persName>, leader of the Peopleʼs National Congress (<gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>), proposed in the Legislative Assembly that a three-party coalition government be formed to run British Guiana until elections are held under proportional representation (<gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss>) later this year. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs reasoning for suggesting a coalition now with the Peopleʼs Progressive Party (<gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>) and the United Force (<gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss>) was that it would lessen tensions and allow for more vigorous police action to control the situation. He further believed that acceptance of an interim coalition would mean that Premier <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName> had acknowledged <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> as the voting system. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>, however, indicated that he would go no further with this idea unless it was accepted by <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName>, leader of the <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss>.</item>

His coalition would last for from two to four years before new elections are held; these elections would be held under a combination of <gloss target="#t_PR1">PR</gloss> and the old voting system of first-past-the-post. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> proposed that the ministries be equally divided between the two parties, with <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> as Prime Minister and <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> as Deputy Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> suggested that the coalition continue after independence when the Ministries of Home Affairs and Defense would be divided between the two parties.

                        <p>443. Premier <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> called me to his office late afternoon June 26 and talked over an hour along following lines. For first time he is seriously worried about what is happening in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> and where it is going. Several years ago he thought <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> had bright future; there was much waiting to be done in way of economic development and possibility help solve problems outside <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>. For example, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad were all facing pressing economic problems resulting partly from exploding populations. They were trying solve this by some industrialization but would never be able to keep up. In fact, all these places were just barely keeping the lid on. (He apologized at this point for digressing.)</p>
                        <p>Now in British Guiana there was this deplorable violence, senseless retaliation, and there seemed no end in sight. A few days ago he had to take his daughter out of school in Georgetown because of harassment by classmates. Several times he asked somewhat rhetorically “what can be done?” I asked if he were satisfied that he and the two opposition leaders had done everything that was within their power, individually as well as collectively, to stop the violence. He said he thought so but that everybody could not be controlled. He said he <pb n="869" xml:id="pg_869" facs="0904"/>wanted this to be a very frank discussion. I asked him if he believed people in Mazaruni had anything to do with violence. He quickly replied that he did not think so but there was this theory of a plan. He said he wished to talk about solutions.</p>
                        <p>He said as I knew he had been seeking coalition but his efforts had come to nothing. In past few days he had been talking with Governor about such possibility and now he wished to talk with me. As long as U.S. was opposed to having <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> in coalition or in government at all, <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> would refuse. During coalition negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> when Ghanaian delegation was here, <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> had made concession after concession, including parity in cabinet, but <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> always had another demand. This experience and subsequent ones simply illustrate that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> will not go against wishes of U.S.</p>
                        <p>He had thought many times about what caused his relations with U.S. to “go sour.” He still did not know specifically how this happened. He used to go annually from 1957 to 1961 to the U.S. and personal relations were very good. In 1961 he had talks with President <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Kennedy</persName>, Chester Bowles, Schlesinger, and other top officials. They had probed him very deeply and he had every reason to believe that he had passed the test. He had been quite frank with them about his socialist views. Generally speaking he was inclined to think there were two reasons for the deterioration: opposition leaders in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> had effectively spread word in U.S. that he was Communist and secondly, there had been U.S. trouble with Cuba. These two elements, in interacting way, had given impression that he was potential menace to U.S. This was myth but was now fact of life in U.S. which he must recognize. In actual fact, he said, U.S. need have no concern on this score.</p>
                        <p>Recently he had talked with various elements in Georgetown including Pres. Chamber of Commerce, businessmen, Catholic Church, etc. about possible solution to <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> problem. Several had told him that he and <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> were Communist, that there was fear of regimentation, exclusion of private enterprise, and, if independent, of invitation by him to Soviets and Cubans to come in. He told them in essence that his record belied any danger to private enterprise. He had publicly pledged to keep his hands off sugar and bauxite industries, and as for regimentation, there could be ironclad guarantees in constitution and he was not fool enough to try tear up constitution with opposition being so strong in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>. As for Soviets and Cubans, he was prepared have treaty of neutrality, e.g., along Austrian lines. If U.S. wanted, it could have right to intervene. This was in fact unnecessary because he realized U.S. would intervene in any event if its security were threatened. Some businessmen had mentioned <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> might be another Zanzibar, but he realized <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> in same hemisphere as U.S. and events which take place in Africa would not be permitted to take place here.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> said in final analysis only three courses now possible in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>: (1) coalition; (2) civil war; (3) partition. He thought coalition was dependent on U.S. He thought partition was no solution and recalled difficulties and suffering which ensued when India was partitioned. Economically partition would not make sense, but <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> already is drifting toward partition. (I agreed that partition would not represent progress.) He could see no end to violence without coalition. Uncontrollable groups were now operating. I asked whether when he said coalition he meant all three parties. He said no, he meant <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> because their objectives were more similar and in any event there should be an opposition party. I asked whether he had in mind coalition now before election or after or both. He did not see much value in coalition before election since ministers would just be settling into their jobs “when the dog fight of elections would start in October or November,” but he was willing to consider it. He was more interested in agreement for coalition after elections. While he much preferred postponement of election to give time to work out problems, he was willing to consider acceptance of no postponement. He added that <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> had not yet decided whether to contest those elections.</p>
                        <p>He then asked where U.S. stood and what my views were. I told him that U.S. was assuming that course of events would be determined by elections in implementation of Colonial Secretaryʼs decision and that after the elections we would presumably know with what government we would be dealing. In meantime, pending basic political decision by electorate, we were in effect simply waiting. I indicated incidental opinion that he placed far too much weight on view that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> acted on basis of what he thought U.S. wanted. In my experience, politicians of all kinds were guided primarily, if not entirely, by what they thought would get votes and how they would fare at polls. I suggested that what happens in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> is for parties here to decide and matters of coalition or no coalition were not matters for U.S. to determine but could and undoubtedly would be decided by political leaders here. I mentioned that if he wished I would report his views exactly insofar as possible as presented to me. He was extremely pleased. I cautioned however that there would not necessarily be any response but that channels of communication were open and I would faithfully report his views at any time.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> gave controlled performance. He was purposely calm, reasonable, most courteous, earnest. Only sign of tension was slight shaking of hands at times; otherwise he seemed relaxed. It is obvious that he would give almost anything to obtain U.S. support and will leap at any possibility of favorable response. We can probably expect some more peace feelers.</p>

                                <item>“1. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/UK talks on British Guiana on 16 July<note n="2" xml:id="d385fn2">In a July 11 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> reported that he and <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName> intended “to discuss tactics” with the British and that “our objective continues to be the holding of elections later this year under a system of proportional representation which hopefully will result in the formation of a new Government replacing the <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> regime.” <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> added that the threat to this objective “arises from the deteriorating security situation and from <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs efforts to exploit a situation for which he and his followers are primarily responsible, so as to secure a postponement of the elections.” (Ibid., Country File, British Guiana, Vol. I, Memos, 12/63–7/64)</note> chaired by Sir Hilton Poynton, Permanent Undersecretary of the Colonial Office, produced basic agreement on an assessment of the security situation, electoral prospects, and the need to proceed on course with elections in late November or early December. There was agreement on both sides that, although results might be close, registration figures indicated that Premier <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName>, at best, could get no more than 48 per cent and probably would not get more than 46 per cent of the vote. This calculation did not presume that an alternative East Indian party would have any strength, and both sides agreed every effort should be made to keep them from falling by the wayside.</item>
                                <item>“2. The British maintained that the principal threat to elections comes from the deteriorating security situation. They suggested that even with one division peace and order could not be guaranteed. The situation in Georgetown is particularly critical in that violence there could force the postponement of elections. The British urged that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Forbes Burnham</persName>, leader of the Peopleʼs National Congress (<gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>), be counselled to exercise all possible restraint on his supporters in Georgetown. They noted that the London papers played up the killing of Indian children, omitting African deaths and arson.</item>
                                <item>“3. The British said the Governor had suggested he be authorized to try to obtain a <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>/Peopleʼs Progressive Party coalition as a means of reducing tension in the pre-electoral period. They acknowledged that assurances of success were limited, but thought that failure might be attributed to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> and serve to discredit him. We explained the bases of our opposition and found that the British did not take issue with them.</item>
                                <item>“4. On the assumption a non-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> government could be formed, we said we would be prepared to extend the same financial assistance we agreed last October. The British suggested the formation of a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/UK/Canada joint development commission to work out a long term plan. We made it clear that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid was predicated on <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs not being included in the post election government.</item>
                                <item>“5. When the British inquired what policy might be should <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> win, we reiterated that such a situation would be politically intolerable in the United States.</item>

                                <item>“6. On the question of the envoy to the United States the British said they could not oppose if <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> came in a private capacity and expressed hope he would be received. We said we had made no plans to receive him or any other emissary and hoped the situation would not arise.</item>
                                <item>“7. The question of possible steps to assist in the security problem were discussed at length and the British agreed to explore with the Governor, who will be recalled for consultation soon:

                            <item>The meeting was called to discuss the attached cable from Georgetown.<note n="2" xml:id="d386fn2">Telegram Georgetown IN 35522, July 24, from <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName>; attached but not printed.

                            <item>The group agreed that a visit to the U.S. by a <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> emissary would be a bad thing. At worst, such a visit would be interpreted to mean that the U.S. supports <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName>; at best it would be interpreted as a sign that we can live with him. The visit would hurt the opposition parties in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> and would not help us domestically.</item>

                            <item>The group then discussed whether it would be advisable to send a lower-level official down to <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> to talk to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName> as well as to the two opposition leaders. The advantages of this would be that we would appear reasonable (“willing to listen”), and that it might allow us to stall for time and reduce the rate of violence in the months between now and the <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> elections. The main disadvantage is that any talks with <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> will probably be misinterpreted by the uncommitted voters in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>—which number about 10%; such talks might indicate to these voters that “perhaps the U.S. does not think <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi</persName> is so bad.”</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The group agreed that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs request to send an envoy to the U.S. should be turned down and that we should not offer to send someone down to <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>. However, we should use more gentle wording than the flat assertion now under consideration—i.e. “This proposal has been informally discussed with the Americans and they see no useful purpose for it. Therefore, it would be better if the proposal were dropped.” Instead, a more flexible position should be adopted which offers a quid pro quo—i.e. when the violence stops, we will reconsider the proposal. The group decided that a cable should be drafted in this sense and sent to London,<note n="3" xml:id="d386fn3">An attached undated telegram to London requested the Embassy to ask the Colonial Office to modify its instructions to the Governor to the following: “This proposal has been informally discussed with the Americans who see no useful purpose in it at this time. The Americans are obviously influenced in this point of view by continuing pattern of violence in British Guiana and widespread belief in British Guiana, as elsewhere, that <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> as governing party bears heavy responsibility this state of affairs. Their subsequent attitude toward question of emissary naturally would be influenced by course of events in British Guiana.” (Ibid.)</note> with an information copy to Georgetown (copy attached).<note n="4" xml:id="d386fn4">According to an August 1 telegram from <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName>, the Governor delivered the message to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> on July 30, but omitted the part suggesting that the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> was responsible for the violence. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> made no objection, observing that “it means then that if things stay quiet emissary will be received” to which the Governor responded that he could not speculate beyond the wording of the message.

                        <p>I fully appreciate your concern at continuing violence in British Guiana and your desire to find some way of preventing a situation developing which could necessitate postponement of the elections you intend holding in the colony later this year. I also sympathize with your capable and courageous Governor in his efforts to carry out his responsibilities under such trying conditions. In the circumstances I am somewhat hesitant to raise again the doubts and misgivings about a pre-election coalition which we expressed to your people at the recent London talks. Since, however, we are in complete agreement on the constructive objectives we are pursuing in British Guiana, I have no hesitation in doing so.</p>
                        <p>In the first place we seriously doubt that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>, who has been using violence for political purposes, would be likely to forego such tactics if a coalition were formed. Apart from that consideration there is, in our opinion, the very real possibility that a pre-election coalition would adversely affect the electoral prospects of the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> by confusing the supporters of those two parties. A coalition of the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> excluding the <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> would endanger the hoped for post election <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> coalition which at the moment is the only possibility of replacing the <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> Government. In short, we share your view of the importance of holding the elections later this year but are concerned that nothing be done in the pre-election period in the quest for order and security which would jeopardize the currently hopeful electoral results.</p>
                        <p>Since the London talks on July 16 and 17 there have been several developments in British Guiana which may be relevant. The strike of the sugar workers has been ended in what amounts to a defeat for <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>. Whether this will result in any immediate improvement in the security situation, of course, remains to be seen. I also understand that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> has broken off his “unity” talks with <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>. In the course of those talks he clearly indicated that the coalition he seeks has as its objective postponement of the elections. He showed no interest in a coalition limited to a brief pre-election period but insisted on a five year coalition.</p>

                        <p>I would be most grateful if you would give further consideration to these very real concerns on our part about the dangers of such a course of action.<note n="2" xml:id="d388fn2">In a personal message to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, attached to an August 17 covering note from the British Embassy, <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName>ʼ deputy, Sir Hilton Poynton, reported that the risk of violence was diminished and the case for a temporary coalition was therefore less strong. Poynton stated that he was sure that <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> would agree, upon his return from holiday, that the idea should not be pursued under these circumstances. If, however, violence were to set in again at the pitch it reached in June and July, a temporary coalition might be reconsidered. (Ibid.)</note>

The anti-<gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> forces are bound to have plenty of problems with one another in the future. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> and the British do not get along. The Governor does not like <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>, who twists the lionʼs tail whenever he can. We can expect to see a growing British/<persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> problem. <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> said that while he is trying to build a relationship with <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>, it is tough to do so. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>, a racist and probably anti-white, remembers slights and repays them; at the same time, he takes advantage of people who treat him softly.

                        <p>In our view, following considerations argue for desirability of expediting preparations for elections and setting election date as early in November as feasible with appropriate announcement earliest: (1) Possible complicity of <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> in Georgetown violence and conceivably his indictment (which Governor considering), (2) likelihood of attempts by Jaganites and others to use such prospects to delay elections and seek alternative courses of action, (3) uncertainty of opposition groups over date of election, and (4) adverse effect of any late date on present momentum of opposition parties.</p>
                        <p>Appreciate Embassy conveying this thought to Coloff soonest since Governor <persName corresp="#p_LSR1">Luyt</persName> in London this week and will be consulting <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName>.</p>

                        <p>IN 86222. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] pass following message from <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName>:</p>
                        <p>In discussions with <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> at his initiative early this week I found him relaxed and confident. He apparently believes election largely matter of getting vote out and having organized to do so along <pb n="881" xml:id="pg_881" facs="0916"/>lines of U.S. party he foresees no particular problem. Every week or so he plans to spend few days in countryside talking to small groups and has already done so in African pockets of Corantyne. He prefers this method rather than mass meetings in order minimize problem of security. He plans no concentrated campaign with mass meetings until last 3–4 weeks before December 7 election. His party manifesto will appear at start that phase of campaign. In meantime he plans issue separate pamphlets unemployment, education, roads, and rice.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> was especially interested in any ammunition we could provide to counter <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs exploitation of theme that Cuban rice market depends on his continuation in office. I told him we were aware of this problem and would see what we could develop.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> also much interested in what specifics he could promise in way of projects. I suggested (1) improvement of East Coast road; (2) maintenance of sea wall; (3) airport improvements, including new terminal building; (4) Berbice Bar cut. Re sea wall I pointed out he could claim regime jeopardized lives and property by failure do maintenance work over last few years. He could call attention to break in wall and flooding near Buxton early this year. He picked this up with alacrity. He also apparently liked Berbice Bar cut (which incidentally may improve his relations with New Amsterdam <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> boss Kendall who is not always enthusiastic about <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>). He was all for East Coast road, but also suggested desirability improving road from New Amsterdam to Skeldon in Corantyne, saying need was especially great because not only is road in miserable condition but also there is no railroad. He also wanted Atkinson–Mackenzie road (estimated total cost U.S. $8 million) and mentioned desirability developing road to Potaro and eventually on to Brazil. He thought this road would open up agricultural areas. Although he sought my immediate approval to road in Corantyne and Atkinson–Mackenzie road, I made clear I was not in position to go beyond East Coast road without further authorization. He asked me to look particularly into possible authorization of Corantyne road. He has in mind after very brief respite following election to announce full-scale program. He would like during four-year term to complete as many short-range projects as possible and to have made sufficient start on number of long-range projects that public can clearly see what future portends from <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> administration. Shortly after announcing his program he apparently wishes to make tour abroad, not only for purposes prestige or recognition but also to collect commitments for financial or economic assistance. He did not specify what countries he has in mind but it will undoubtedly include Germany and U.S. He mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> had apparently been given much attention when he visited Washington in 1961. I have little doubt that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> will expect be received by the President and that he is already leading up to this suggestion.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It would be politically desirable for <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> to advocate Corantyne road since it would so clearly benefit Indian community as well as have immediate impact as adjunct of East Coast road. This road passes through rice and sugar areas from New Amsterdam to Skeldon and is 48 miles long. In 1949–53 this road was rebuilt and paved reportedly at a cost of about U.S. $3 million, but because of faulty engineering and construction it deteriorated almost completely after 4 years. Since then it has been occasionally patched. It is estimated that rehabilitation and paving with asphalt could be done for about U.S. $1.5 million. It is suggested that Department explore feasibility of permitting me inform <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> Corantyne road may also be improved.<note n="2" xml:id="d391fn2">In an unnumbered telegram to <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> dated October 7, <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> could be assured that the United States would assist British Guiana in road improvement projects and that this would include East Coast roads at least as far as Skelton. Regarding the Atkinson–MacKenzie road, <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName> said that “assurances must be hedged at this time,” due to the question of how best to finance all the road projects. (Ibid.)</note> The Department may wish consider whether touch base Colonial Office to obtain their concurrence to substitute Corantyne road for some other project or projects of equivalent value now on U.S.–U.K. agreed list. (Actually this road could be considered part of East Coast road.) <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> will doubtlessly be raising matter of both Corantyne and possibly Atkinson–Mackenzie road with me shortly in order start preparing pamphlet on roads. Therefore, sooner we can decide whether we bless Corantyne road at least in principle the better.</p>

                        <p>Since August 1961 the problems of British Guiana as it approaches independence have been discussed at the highest levels of our two governments with a view to seeking ways whereby the colony may obtain independence without posing a threat to the security of its neighbors in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>As you know, Latin America is an area of the greatest importance to us. The establishment of an independent government in British Guiana under leadership which has been markedly receptive to communist ideas and vulnerable to communist subversion would create an intolerable situation for the United States and other countries in the Hemisphere. Previous British Governments have shown an understanding of this situation [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] affording a full opportunity for the United States to express its views. [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>] The President hopes you will share with him the conviction that it should continue along present lines.</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of the United States Government that the proposed elections in British Guiana under Proportional Representation, despite the difficulties entailed, provide a democratic means through which the aspirations of all the people and races of British Guiana can be faithfully reflected. We believe that if the electorate participates fully in the elections the results can provide a basis for the formation of a representative government in which the possibility of communist infiltration will be significantly reduced. It is our intention to do what we can to assist a non-communist government in British Guiana so that the country at the earliest practicable date may attain independence with economic and social stability and have the prospect of playing a useful role in the hemisphere and in the community of free nations.<note n="3" xml:id="d392fn3">Bruce did not get an opportunity to talk to <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Wilson</persName> personally (the British Labor Party won the general parliamentary elections of October 15 and Harold Wilson, as party leader, became Prime Minister) and transmit this message, but did give it to <persName corresp="#p_WPG1">Patrick Gordon Walker</persName>, the new Labor Foreign Secretary; see <ref target="#d394">Document 394</ref>.</note>

                        </list>
                        <p>Several weeks after the Anglo–<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> consultations in July 1964 violence in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> came to a virtual halt with the end of the sugar workers strike, and the beginning of the election campaign. In mid-August a new East Indian party was formed—the Justice Party—and <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> announced that the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> would participate in the elections “under protest.”</p>
                        <pb n="887" xml:id="pg_887" facs="0922"/>
                        <p>The campaign is now in full swing with the deposit of electoral lists October 26, and the three major parties, as well as several new parties are active. As the campaign intensifies the likelihood of violence increases but every effort is being made to maintain security. To this end the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has just supplied 20 radio transmitter receivers and 10 jeeps for the police.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs actions indicate that he is on the defensive. He is blaming his governmentʼs failure to receive assistance on reactionary elements in the U.S. and the U.K., and he maintains that the intense internal dissatisfaction with his administration is attributable solely to outside influences. The most recent estimate from the Colonial office suggests <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> would get only 40% of the vote if elections were held today. Last July we thought he would get from 45% to 48%.</p>
                        <p>We are preparing to move ahead with an assistance program for a non-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> government in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>. The program would consist of road rehabilitation, maintenance of the seawall, making a cut through the Berbice Bar to open up the New Amsterdam area, and construction of a road from Atkinson field to the interior. An <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> representative will go to <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> November 4 to investigate the degree to which the <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> administrative services can be used in implementing the projects.</p>
                        <p>We must anticipate that if <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> loses by a close vote HMG will press us to agree to a <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> coalition government after elections. They may argue that only in a <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> coalition can the major groups in the population be represented; that a government which does not contain the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> will be under continuing attack designed to keep it from governing effectively; and that an African dominated <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> government will seek to intimidate and repress the East Indians.</p>
                        <p>We believe a <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> coalition after the elections would only add to <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>ʼs problems. It would be politically impossible for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to assist a government in which <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> and his colleagues played a role. Intense personal rivalry between <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> would contribute to instability and intensify racial antagonisms. We hope that a coalition government can be formed without the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> and that it will be genuinely multi-racial.<note n="2" xml:id="d396fn2">Telegram 125 from Georgetown, October 26, reported a 2-hour discussion between <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> on October 23, during which the latter spoke of his thoughts about whom he wanted for the various cabinet positions in his coming government, with United Front and Justice Party leaders slotted for minor positions. <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs “current thinking somewhat disturbing because may indicate intention make coalition government unduly <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> dominated with other partiesʼ participation kind of sham,” which <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> said would be “very divisive” and would lead to a <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> administration of “one term or less.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 14 BR GU)</note> We will use the influence we have in support of such a government.</p>

                        <p>By way of background the Secretary described the great problem in the Western Hemisphere of ensuring that the long overdue social and economic revolution is carried out democratically and without communist exploitation. He noted that the long tradition of the Monroe Doctrine means the strongest possible feeling in the United States against foreign intervention in this Hemisphere. In the case of Cuba, the two non-negotiable points are the Soviet presence and Cuban interference in the affairs of other Hemisphere countries. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> has shown no willingness to cease this interference although the Cubans have suffered reverses in the case of Venezuela and the recent election in Chile.</p>
                        <p>The prospect that the United Kingdom might leave behind in an independent British Guiana a second <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> regime would be a major concern to the United States. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> has received aid from <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName> and has meddled in Surinam. We cannot take a chance on him [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. Proportional Representation offers the possibility of unseating <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> and obviating the need for direct British administration. We are prepared to give substantial assistance to a non-communist, non-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> government. The Secretary described the British Guiana problem as a gut issue on which we need the help of the British Government. He expressed the hope that the elections in British Guiana would be held as scheduled. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>In his reply, the Foreign Secretary remarked that a Labor Government could not do less than the Conservatives with respect to trade <pb n="889" xml:id="pg_889" facs="0924"/>possibilities with Cuba. He said, however, that he would look into the suggestion made earlier by the Secretary that Britain as an alternative to trading with Cuba attempt to improve its trade ties with other Latin American countries. The Secretary said he would send the Foreign Secretary a message on what we thought might be done to strengthen UK relations with the Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>With respect to British Guiana, the Foreign Secretary gave the assurance that his Government would proceed with the elections as scheduled. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] The Foreign Secretary said he had a very unfavorable opinion of <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> who is a thoroughly unreliable person. Regardless of the outcome, the election will provide no answer to the problem of racial conflict and therefore there is little prospect of early independence emerging from it. The previous Government committed itself to an early post-election conference on independence, which in the view of the Labor Government, was not desirable. He thought the preferable course of development would be along the lines of self-government with a Commonwealth Court consisting perhaps of Indians, Nigerians and Canadians to deal with the racial conflict. The actual date for independence could be fuzzed. The Foreign Secretary expressed the hope that even if British Guiana does not obtain early independence, it will nevertheless be possible for the United States to furnish aid. He added that <persName corresp="#p_WE1">Eric Williams</persName> on a recent visit to London had advised strongly against early independence.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we would be quite happy to see an indefinite continuation of British authority in British Guiana. Perhaps the Organization of American States might ask the British Government not to grant independence while racial strife continues.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> added the comment that a <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> coalition would make it impossible to get Congressional approval of aid for British Guiana. The Foreign Secretary indicated that he recognized a <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> coalition would not work although the British Government could not take a public position to this effect.</p>

                        <p>The President and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Wilson</persName> joined the group at about 1:10 p.m. The President said that he had had a very enjoyable meeting with the Prime Minister, that both of them had discussed how to get reelected. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Wilson</persName> said that he had very much enjoyed their talk which had related to principles, objectives and political background. They had not tried to get into any arguments for or against any particular solutions. The President said that he and the Prime Minister had whole-heartedly agreed that our objectives and hopes stand upon having a proper understanding of each other. It was better to talk across the table than in the columns of newspapers. He had told <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Wilson</persName> that “a burned child dreads fire,” and that he didnʼt intend to pressure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Wilson</persName>, and he felt sure that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Wilson</persName> did not intend to pressure him. The President went on to say that he thought it would be useful for our two governments to continue to “reason together,” as recommended in Isaiah. He felt that this meeting was a continuance of previous meetings which would permit both sides to explore their common problems and discuss them. Nothing would emerge from this meeting that was black on white or of a nature to make other countries feel that a blueprint of action had been developed by our two governments. We were not undertaking to provide answers to our problems at this meeting. The President said that he had to be very careful because of what the press tended to write.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary reported to the President very briefly on the discussions at Ministerial level which had been held while the two principals were talking alone that morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d399fn2">A December 7 memorandum of conversation reported <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>ʼs discussion with Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WPG1">Walker</persName> that morning concerning British Guiana. <persName corresp="#p_WPG1">Walker</persName> said that HMG would not “go toward independence in the foreseeable future. Perhaps some steps toward increasing self-government could be devised.” The Foreign Minister added that he thought that the U.S. Government “had an excessively favorable estimate of <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>.” (Ibid., POL 16 BR GU)</note> It had been decided that we would discuss defense questions this afternoon, also Southeast Asia, Southwest Africa, and other matters. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Wilson</persName> said that he wanted to talk to the President about British Guiana. He had told <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> that whoever wins in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>, the UK would not grant <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> independence as there would be a blood bath if it did so.<note n="3" xml:id="d399fn3">In a December 6 memorandum to the President, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> urged <persName>Johnson</persName> “to demonstrate your personal interest” in British Guiana to <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Wilson</persName> by emphasizing that the United States attached great importance to a satisfactory outcome, that independence should not be granted prematurely, that the United States could not provide assistance to any government which included <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>, and that it was hoped that close cooperation and aid would contribute to a racially peaceful, democratic, and non-Communist British Guiana. (Ibid., POL BR GU)</note> He thought that if both <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> (the latter of whom he described as a naive Trotskyite) were out of <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> it would be so much the better. He didnʼt think a government could be entrusted to either of them and the UK rather felt that the U.S. placed excessive trust in <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> who was just as bad in his own way as <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> was in his. In fact, interjected <persName corresp="#p_WPG1">Gordon Walker</persName>, “they are both horrors.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Wilson</persName> said that it would be necessary to arrange for a Canadian or an Australian distinguished judicial figure to go down to British Guiana in order to lay the groundwork for the organization of the judiciary, eventually.</p>

                        <p>December 7, 1964, elections in British Guiana resulted in <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs Peoplesʼ Progressive Party gaining 45.6 percent of the popular vote and 24 seats in the legislature. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs Peoplesʼ
National Congress (<gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>) won 40.5 percent of the popular vote and 22 seats in the legislature. However, in accordance with the constitutional tradition in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, the Governor offered the Premiership to Forbes <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> as the person commanding the most <pb n="893" xml:id="pg_893" facs="0928"/>confidence of the legislature as a whole. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> was asked to form a government, and he did so by placing his party in coalition with <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName>ʼs United Force (<gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss>), which had won 12.5 percent of the popular vote and 7 seats in the legislature. It took several weeks for the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> to agree on terms for a coalition.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> initially refused to resign as Premier and he did so only after an Order in Council was issued in London authorizing his removal. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> later held a press conference in which he promised strong but non-violent opposition to the new government.</p>
                        <p>In telegram 196 from Georgetown, December 10, <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> reported that the most striking aspect of the election was the extent of racial voting. He reported that “in one district after another the number of votes for <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> was approximately the same as number of registered Indian voters.” <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> said that the cause of “such complete racial voting by Indians apparently stems from fear and distrust of African-led government” and that the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>ʼs propaganda and pre-election violence played on those fears and “created psychology which made Indians impervious to reason. Thus Indians deserted United Force with its advocacy of multi-racial approach, non-violence, and prosperity. Likewise rejected was Justice Party leader Raiʼs logical appeal to Indian self-interest to obtain share in non-<gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> administration which was certain to come about as result of election.” <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> concluded that the consequence of this racial voting was that the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> coalition would have to govern without significant Indian representation.</p>
                        <p>Considering the future, <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> was pessimistic about the depth of the racial cleavage in British Guiana. He speculated that while the <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> administration would probably try to “demonstrate responsibility, improved government, and assistance” to all Guianese, it seemed unlikely that such an approach would lead to <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs re-election within the next few years, “especially in view of increased number of eligible Indian voters at that time. Therefore it might be expected before another election <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> administration may seriously toy with more radical solutions, possibly e.g. seeking obtain independence in order to tamper with the electoral system.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 14 BR GU)</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The talks were from our standpoint most satisfactory. We found that in the British view so long as <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> continues as the leader of the Indian community racial harmony cannot be re-established without a <pb n="896" xml:id="pg_896" facs="0931"/>rapprochement between him and <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>. You will note that we took issue with this concept pointing out that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs record does not justify any assumption that he can serve as a basis for the establishment of racial harmony. I believe we have in effect bought time which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> can use to try to allay the Indian fears. If <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs actions bear out the intentions of his speeches, there may be some basis for hope.<note n="3" xml:id="d402fn3">The agreed minutes of the U.K.–U.S. consultations reported that U.S. officials made the case that “the Justice Party could continue to serve a useful purpose” as an alternative for Indian voters and that Indian confidence could be won by including Indians in the government and in other public bodies, especially in the police force.

(Ibid., British Guiana Chronological File, 1964)</note> we found that HMG was in such a state of indecision regarding the role of its new Ministry of Overseas Development that we could not get authority for Mr. Yoe to proceed to Georgetown on January 1.<note n="5" xml:id="d402fn5">The record of the U.S.–U.K. meeting on economic aid to British Guiana is reported in a memorandum of conversation, dated December 18.

                        <p>In the absence of Lord Harlech, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMNF1">Stewart</persName> was asked to come in to see the Secretary today on the subject of British Guiana. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> explained that the Secretary had been obliged to go to the White House and had instructed him to convey his views to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMNF1">Stewart</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We believe that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> has not done badly since taking office and that he has adopted a moderate and constructive line in his public statements regarding racial conciliation. We are under no illusions about <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs weaknesses and shortcomings. He is not ideal, but nevertheless he is the only alternative at present to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We have told <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> that we would move ahead rapidly on an aid program immediately after the British Guiana elections. We are ready to do so and wish to send an <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> official, Mr. Yoe, to Georgetown to work out details. Any delay, we are convinced, would have extremely adverse consequences. Such delay would destroy <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs confidence in us and make his relations with Governor <persName corresp="#p_LSR1">Luyt</persName> difficult.</p>
                        <p>We are asking, therefore, with great urgency that the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary authorize our going ahead with the implementation of our aid program.<note n="2" xml:id="d403fn2">At a January 8 meeting <persName corresp="#p_SMNF1">Stewart</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> that “HMG warmly welcomes the U.S. (aid) proposal.” (Memorandum of conversation, January 8; ibid., POL 2 BR GU)</note> We have had a formal request from <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> dated December 29 which he states has been submitted with the agreement of the Governor.<note n="3" xml:id="d403fn3">Not found.</note> We have instructed our Embassy in London to give copies of the letter of request to the Colonial Office and the Ministry of Overseas Development. To get the program under way at the earliest date, we are proposing that Mr. Yoe and an engineer proceed to Georgetown on or about January 10.</p>

                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMNF1">Stewart</persName>ʼs question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName> said that we had outlined our proposed aid program during our talks with British officials in London on December 17 and 18. We had also at that time said that we would like to send Mr. Yoe to Georgetown at the beginning of January.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMNF1">Stewart</persName> said that he would report immediately to London on this conversation and our request for clearance for Mr. Yoeʼs visit.<note n="4" xml:id="d403fn4">In a January 23 letter to <persName corresp="#p_CKM1">Crockett</persName>, Harry W. Yoe (<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>) reported that he had arrived in British Guiana on January 15 and met with <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> and Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>, and was impressed that they and other figures in the government and the civil service had a “sincere desire to utilize the assistance given in the most efficient manner,” but that work on the roads and sea wall was hampered by a shortage of machinery and trucks. Yoe suggested that equipment could be obtained quickly from “ready stocks of the Navy.” (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File, British Guiana, Vol. III, Memos, 12/64–11/65)</note>

                            <item>While <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> no doubt disappointed over emergency powers, he has gained far more than he realizes, and rather than be discouraged he should build on his gains. For example, securing <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Greenwood</persName>ʼs agreement to amendment constitution to permit appointment Ramphal as Attorney General is master stroke and real achievement. Tactically <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> should play this appointment up as major step toward racial harmony and betterment relations between races. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> might wish announce further that he will no longer press for lifting emergency powers. Will ask new Attorney General to undertake thorough study conditions and thereafter advise the Governor, Premier and Cabinet when emergency might be lifted. This is suggested as one way getting over this hurdle and avoiding any “horse trade.”</item>

                        <p>376. Following is course of developments over past 36 hours in <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> budget crisis since our tel 375 London 201<note n="2" xml:id="d407fn2">In telegram 375 from Georgetown, April 9, <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> reported his talk with <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> earlier that day about the latterʼs intention to resign. <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> he had “no political future,” the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> intended to merge with or swallow up his party, and that, therefore, he would direct all his efforts towards doing a “good job as finance minister.” <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> thought that since “there is no hope in hell of balancing the budget” due to <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> politically inspired spending increases, that the only hope for the country was “in providing image which will attract private investment” through a good budget, “especially by abolition property tax.” (Ibid.)</note> which indicated grave threat to continued coalition. This threat now appears to have been brought under control and impasse resolved after intensive pressure by ConGen.</p>
                        <p>During mayorʼs reception evening April 9 for newly appointed <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> commissioner to UK, Lionel Luckoo, Minister of Works and Hydraulics Kassim (<gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss>) told me that at cabinet meeting scheduled that evening it was anticipated that decision would be made for <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> to leave cabinet. Kassim did not know whether other <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> ministers would remain but thought they would. This meeting apparently went far into night but without real results. <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> did not attend but other <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> ministers did with his permission.</p>
                        <p>On morning April 10 at briefing on rice problem by Dr. Efferson (<persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> of School of Agriculture, Louisiana State University) in <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs office which was attended by Kassim, Minister of Trade and Industry Kendall, Minister of Agriculture JOHN, and by myself and other <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> representatives, message was received about one hour later from <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> summoning key ministers to special meeting at his residence. On way out I urged Kendall, whose political judgment <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> respects, to see that if <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> had to go that it be done smoothly on grounds personal and health reasons, preferably with commendatory letter of appreciation from <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>, but sought impress on Kendall importance of retrieving situation if at all possible. I also spoke with Kassim, who seemed uncertain and depressed. Gave him same advice along with view that <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>ʼs departure from government would be damaging but departure of <gloss target="#t_UF1">UFs</gloss> would be disastrous and consequently every effort must be made to retain <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>ʼs services.</p>
                        <pb n="904" xml:id="pg_904" facs="0939"/>
                        <p>Toward midnight April 10 I learned [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] that <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> executive had held meeting at which <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> claimed matter of principle and substance was involved on which he felt strongly: that partyʼs choices were: (1) for him to resign with other <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> ministers remaining; (2) for all <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> ministers to resign; and (3) for all <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> members to resign from legislative assembly. After lengthy discussions executive voted for all ministers (3) to resign and to defer question of leaving assembly (7 members) until constitutional aspects could be determined. Report also indicated that <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> scheduled meet with <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> at 9 a.m. April 11 for final session.</p>
                        <p>Immediately sought reach <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> without success. Called <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> early morning April 11. He was just arising so invited him to breakfast. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] Decided try combination of flattery, pleading, and strong language related to horrible consequences of breakdown anti-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> forces. Told <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> how much <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> entities appreciated his contributions to <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> administration, what favorable impact his presence in government had on various visitors, e.g., that American businessmen usually say after seeing ministers that they are good but <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> is really outstanding. (<persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> usually does make better impression than any other minister on businessmen.) Told him one of main reasons for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> support and confidence in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> was coalition and constructive role <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> was playing; everyone knew he was outstanding member of cabinet and counting on him; that Washington would not be able believe that on issue of abolition of property tax worth about $1 million he would hand <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> on a silver platter; that I had just been to Washington and had given optimistic appraisal stability <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> administration, and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> on basis such reports had gone to extraordinary lengths to expedite aid and to make it substantial; that because of this stability and his presence in cabinet potential foreign investors were being encouraged; that I could not believe that after all effort put into saving <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> from communism, including strenuous efforts by <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> (all those miles and all those speeches), it was going to be thrown away. I stressed it would be bad enough if he felt he must leave government but to permit <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> to leave was to sell his country out; that with all trouble spots Secretary and senior officers had to cope with, such as Vietnam, Russians, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, Chinese, were we now going to have to add <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> to the list? I asked him to think about consequences in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> itself which would doubtless see return to violence, possibly against his own supporters.</p>
                        <p>Then suggested that there must be compromise and that he must realize <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> could not give way totally under ultimatum of resignation. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> must save face and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> must give at least little bit. I asked if he would accept idea of moratorium if I could obtain <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs agreement, or some kind of depletion allowance which <pb n="905" xml:id="pg_905" facs="0940"/>would permit government to collect property taxes with one hand and refund it with the other. We discussed matter and arrived at compromise whereby existing industries could deduct cost of any expansion or capital improvements from taxes owed or, if company did not qualify in this way, purchase of government debentures would be regarded same as paying tax. New industries would be exempt from tax. (First $50,000 is not taxable in any event under existing legislation.) At my insistence he also reluctantly authorized moratorium of two years but only as last resort if <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> rejected above.</p>
                        <p>At this point, with <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>ʼs concurrence, I informed <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> that 9 a.m. meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> postponed if agreeable and I would meet with <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> first. He agreed. <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> said he also wished have <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs agreement to downward revision of income tax rates and to simplifying tax structure by decimal system. This tax now ranges from 6 percent on first $1,000 to 70 percent on $13,200 and above. Total cost of <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>ʼs plan would be about $125,000 BWI. He was prepared not to inaugurate it until 1966 but wished make some allusion to possibility in budget message scheduled April 14.</p>
                        <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> confided other matters which have been bothering him in coalition, some of which are petty annoyances which probably loom much larger than otherwise in view his fatigue: there were too many long cabinet meetings at night with important matters decided at late hours; lack of expeditious handling of agenda items, inadequate air conditioning, and belief that no one but he felt free to be critical. I offered to talk to <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> about reducing number of night sessions or possibly exempting <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> in some fashion, as well as proposing more personal consultation with <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> thought it would be good idea have committee with each side represented on party basis to express freely to the other any matters of concern. I did not commit myself to support this idea as I am not certain that it would be productive.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> throughout whole first part of discussion, kept reiterating desire to resign, but by end of discussion had specifically agreed to stay indefinitely and to give it another try.</p>
                        <p>I saw <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> immediately afterward and informed him of likelihood <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> ministers resigning, possibility of <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> leaving legislative assembly and recalled series of serious consequences previously drawn to his attention. Told him it seemed essential to keep <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> in government at least at this stage and to settle this tax issue at any cost. Told him Washington had been given favorable view of stability his administration during my recent visit, that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would find collapse of coalition over tax involving $1 million incomprehensible, that if events should take this disastrous turn, I had little doubt <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would have to reevaluate its aid program since there would be little point in improving country for <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>. I then described compromise which <pb n="906" xml:id="pg_906" facs="0941"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> was now willing to accept on tax issue and <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> readily accepted it, even claiming he had proposed most of it to <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> yesterday. (This may be more face-saving.) Told <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> that more than just taxes was involved here: <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> was tired, unsure he was really wanted or appreciated, and <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> should pat him on the back occasionally. I outlined <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>ʼs complaints and suggested <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> find ways to ameliorate them. I suggested he call <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> in at least once each week and talk over important matters personally, making clear that <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> was not just another minister. In short, that although <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> might find it distasteful, he should turn on some of his charm.</p>
                        <p>In order not to risk agreement coming apart in <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> meeting, I suggested that no meeting be held but that either <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> or I simply inform <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> of <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs concurrence with tax compromise. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> agreed and telephoned <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>, who said he wished to see <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> anyway “to thrash out a few things.” <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> then asked me to remain during this session. <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> made notes on all major tax changes in new budget, asking <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> in each case to agree. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> was considerate, readily agreed, although offering occasional language changes. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> exempted <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> from cabinet meeting evening April 11 or any meeting April 12 to free him to work on budget. He agreed to try operate cabinet meetings more expeditiously, to consider farming out items to subcommittees, to have better air conditioning in cabinet room, and to have more personal consultation. <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> suggested periodical special committee meeting on party basis in which criticism would be freely offered on any subject without thought of offense. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> agreed but suggested it be limited to cabinet officers and parliamentary secretaries. <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> agreed and read back all of his notes. By this time three hours had passed and <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> invited us sample his bar.<note n="3" xml:id="d407fn3">In an April 12 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_CWB1">Cobb</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName> reported that he sent the following message to <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName>: “Heartiest congratulations your efforts.” (Department of State,<gloss target="#t_INRIL1">INR/IL</gloss> Historical Files, British Guiana Chronological File (<persName corresp="#p_BWC1">Burdett</persName>), 1965)</note>

                        <p>The question of holding a constitutional conference and fixing a date for independence is becoming an increasingly serious issue in British Guiana. Premier <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> is becoming suspicious of both the United States and the United Kingdom and his suspicions have been intensified by press stories in Britain to the effect that the United States Government is opposed to early independence on the grounds that an independent British Guiana might go communist.<note n="2" xml:id="d408fn2">In a telegram from Georgetown for <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName>, May 17, <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> reported that he assured <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> that these press stories were completely false.

                        </p>
                        <p>The British have informed us that they expect to hold the promised constitutional conference as early as practicable, presumably, if all goes well sometime toward the end of this year, but they have not been willing to be this explicit to Premier <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>. Instead they have told him that the conference could not be scheduled until there had been time to study a report on racial imbalance in the public services<note n="3" xml:id="d408fn3">In a telegram from Georgetown for <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName>, May 22, <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> reported that the Governor had confirmed his earlier assurance that the “only stipulation [concerning timing] was that of time to ‘study’ ICJ report before constitutional conference and that there was no mention of requiring its implementation.” (Ibid.)</note> which the British Guiana Government has requested from the International Commission of Jurists.</p>
                        <p>Our Consul General in Georgetown has been told to try to allay <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs suspicions of footdragging on the part of the British and to deny press reports that the United States opposes independence.<note n="4" xml:id="d408fn4">In a telegram from Georgetown for <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName>, June 1, <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> was “quite unimpressed” with and unconvinced by U.S. arguments that the United Kingdom was not dragging its feet on independence. <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> stressed to <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> that the United States did favor early independence. (Ibid.)</note> We have suggested to the British that a more forthcoming reply to <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs request for a constitutional conference in September might be <pb n="908" xml:id="pg_908" facs="0943"/>helpful.<note n="5" xml:id="d408fn5">In a telegram to Georgetown for <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName>, May 21, <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName> reported that he had called in John Killick of the British Embassy and “suggested that HMG might wish to consider being somewhat more forthcoming,” and that there could be “considerable gain were HMG to tell <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> that the conference would be held this year.” (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File, British Guiana, Vol. III, Memos, 12/64–11/65)</note> Specifically we have suggested that since it is their intention to convene this conference this year Premier <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> might be advised of this fact.</p>

In this regard, it is probably true that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> feels he still has a chance so long as the British are around.

                        <p rend="center">UNITED STATES COMMENTS ON BRITISH BRIEF</p>
                        <p>The United States Government has studied with interest the brief on British policy in British Guiana which was received July 23, 1965.</p>
                        <p>The United States welcomes the intention of the British Government to convene the constitutional conference in November which will, among other tasks, fix the date for independence.</p>
                        <p>The United States shares with the British Government the view that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> and his party would attend the <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> represented their <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs behavior since the election in December gives rise to the question whether he <pb n="912" xml:id="pg_912" facs="0947"/>appreciates the responsibilities of the role incumbent upon him as leader of the opposition. His failure to resign the office of Premier, his failure to meet jointly with the Colonial Secretary and present Premier to discuss racial imbalances, his announced intention to refuse to cooperate with the Commission of Inquiry of the International Commission of Jurists, and his erratic pattern of attendance at sessions of the House of Assembly may indicate that no matter what steps are taken he will find some pretext to refuse to attend the Conference. We therefore suggest that consideration should now be given to the possibility that other persons in the Indian community in B.G. may have to be invited in order to assure that this important section of the community be represented at the conference.<note n="2" xml:id="d412fn2">In a brief on British policy in British Guiana, September 3, the British doubted whether they could invite other persons to represent the Indian community if the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> refused to attend, since these special invitees could hardly claim to be democratically elected representatives. (Ibid., POL 32–1 BR GU–VEN)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The United States also shares the British view of the importance of allaying Indian fears for the future, and hopes that the report of the ICJ Commission will contribute toward this objective. We have noted that the British Government is anxious that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs party cooperate with the Commission in order that the report not be open to criticism that evidence was tendered from one side only. Should Dr. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs party fail to avail itself of the opportunity offered by the ICJ Commission it would seem to bear out the view that the leaders of the party are not genuinely interested in alleviating alleged imbalances and discrimination but have used this charge as a smoke screen for their political objectives.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government believes that the racial fears in B.G. will be difficult to assuage, based as they are on deep racial cleaveages. These are not easily susceptible to rapid transformation and several generations may be required to effect more than marginal progress toward this objective. While efforts of government make a contribution toward this task, it should not be assumed that any government, no matter how well intentioned, will be able to eradicate long standing suspicions. Only years of education, association and understanding can break down the wall of segregation on which racial fears rest. Nevertheless there is a major role for the security forces in B.G. to play in the task of seeking stable conditions. The presence of British troops in British Guiana during the past year provides ample evidence for this conclusion. If British troops can remain after independence until adequate local forces are recruited and trained and equipped to meet the security requirements of the area, this would contribute substantially to allaying Indian fears.</p>
                        <pb n="913" xml:id="pg_913" facs="0948"/>
                        <p>Since the maintenance of internal security and stability will be no small task, the nature, composition and objectives of the B.G. security forces will not, we hope, have to take into account the possibility of a foreign threat. The United States hopes that problems arising from the Venezuelan boundary claim can be resolved amicably between two such good friends as Her Majestyʼs Government and the Government of Venezuela. It would be unfortunate if a continuation of this claim were to be used as the pretext for establishing an Army in B.G. or for recruiting security forces in excess of the Governmentʼs domestic requirements and of a nature not suitable to the countriesʼ needs, thereby imposing a possibly excessive burden on the developing economy.</p>
                        <p>The United States welcomes this opportunity to exchange views on B.G. and looks forward to receiving additional briefing on British policy in the Colony.</p>

                            <item>The coalition government of <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Forbes Burnham</persName>ʼs Peopleʼs National Congress (<gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>) and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName>ʼs United Force (<gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss>), installed as a result of the December 1964 elections, is having some success in restoring responsible government to British Guiana. The coalition is not an easy one, however, since <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> neither like nor trust each other and hold conflicting political views. They are united by their opposition to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs opposition Peopleʼs Progressive Party (<gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>) is suffering from increased factionalism caused by conflicting personal ambitions and differences of opinion concerning its role as an opposition party. There is no evidence to indicate that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> has lost the political support of the vast majority of the Indian population. Some evidence is coming to light of <pb n="914" xml:id="pg_914" facs="0949"/>increased Chinese Communist interest in the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>, and a number of party leaders recently visited China including two leaders of the militant group within the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> which reportedly wishes to break away from <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> and form a Communist Party of British Guiana. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> has taken a public position opposing the granting of independence to British Guiana under <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>, and this also has caused him some difficulties.</item>

                            <item>The International Commission of Jurists is now conducting an inquiry in British Guiana into the question of racial imbalance in the public service, including the security forces. It is expected to produce a report about 1 October 1965. The British Government has informed <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> of its intention to convene a conference in London to devise a constitution for British Guiana and to set a date for independence. This conference will take place once the International Commission of Juristsʼ report has been submitted, and a date of 2 November 1965 is tentatively established. If this sequence of events is not interrupted, it is expected that British Guiana will achieve independence in the spring of 1966.</item>

                            <item>The security situation in the country remains disturbed and <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> is believed to be directing arson and sabotage activities, attempting to increase these to such an extent that the British Government will be forced to delay the independence conference. The leadership of the Guiana Agricultural Workersʼ Union (<gloss target="#t_GAWU1">GAWU</gloss>), which is loyal to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>, plans a major strike effort on the sugar estates during August and September. This could lead to racial violence, and it may be <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs intention to utilize the strike for this purpose. Local security forces continue to be less than adequate, and the presence of 1300 British troops is still required to insure internal security.</item>

                        <p>Ref: Message dated 15 September 1965.<note n="2" xml:id="d414fn2">Not found.</note> Following message for <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName> (info Brubeck) from <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Had long and useful discussion with <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> evening September 15 lasting until well after midnight, after which he still planned to do some work at his office. He is not looking as well as he should, probably due to overwork and possibly because of recent crash dieting program which took off about 30 pounds. At moment he also has what seems to be painful sacro-iliac condition.</p>
                        <p>Opportunity arose early in conversation to seek determine how he views central problem of assuring re-election in 1968. It is clear that he prefers to hope that significant fraction Indians can be won over to his party or to one he can work with. If, however, it appears that such development not occurring he then strongly favors program for importation West Indian Negroes and while conceding there would be practical problems, believes they could be overcome. If such program not possible, I gather he would be willing consider such ideas as unitary statehood with Barbados or, conceivably, disenfranchisement of illiterates. <pb n="916" xml:id="pg_916" facs="0951"/>He finds such thoughts very distasteful but believe he would do so if convinced there is no other way to survive politically against <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>This topic enabled me to raise matter of anxiety in some quarters, such as <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss>, regarding his ultimate intentions and to talk to him along following lines. Impression is that there is increasing anxiety within <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> might establish police state. This is undoubtedly having effect on <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> but apparently that is only one aspect of what is bothering him. Indications are that he is becoming dissatisfied again and while situation has not reached stage of crisis comparable to weekend when coalition was in danger of collapse, time to do something about this reviving potential danger is now. It is essential to seek to improve relations with <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> and to try to go to London in general accord.</p>
                        <p>In addition to concern over <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs intentions, <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> apparently feels that he is not being consulted sufficiently, is too often overridden in cabinet on fiscal matters, that expenditures higher than should be and sometimes include unnecessary items, as well as projecting increased expenses next year. His concern is understandable. It is natural for there to be anxiety about intentions in period of great uncertainty when country is emerging as independent. Such apprehension should be recognized and steps taken to cope with it. One must remember that <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> regards itself not as junior partner but as key. On fiscal side, <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>ʼs services are needed. It is not easy task to look after the purse when needs are legion and ministers are in hurry to achieve success, but somebody must do it. He is probably more inflexible than necessary on occasion,<note n="3" xml:id="d414fn3">In a September 16 telegram for <persName corresp="#p_SJH1">Shullaw</persName>, sent earlier in the day, <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> had told him that morning that he was generally concerned by <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs tentative 1966 expenditure plans, and that “there would be a balanced budget for 1966 ‘or else’.” (Ibid., <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName>—Department Messages, Vol. 4, 7/7/65–2/14/69)</note> but perhaps <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> is too much the other way. In any event, substantive points should be talked out and cultivating <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>, in my opinion, would have great effect in facilitation agreement on substantive matters. <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> is man who needs to be appreciated. Complimenting him is effective. I realize this course of action may be disagreeable but politicians—and diplomats—sometimes have disagreeable tasks. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> can do this job. I suggested that he might wish consider some of the following approaches: consult <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> much more frequently; reassure him at appropriate stage soon about intentions; be frank and genuine on this subject; perhaps have him to dinner or other private meeting weekly until London <pb n="917" xml:id="pg_917" facs="0952"/>conference; seek his opinion and advice on various subjects, even if your mind is already made up; compliment him privately and perhaps publicly in press conference just before leaving for London, in course reviewing accomplishments your administration; consider asking him to visit United States and talk to business groups (I told <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> that if this useful I will be prepared give <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> invitation at <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> expense); refrain, at least for present, from raising items involving expenditures which <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> most likely regard as unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> agreed with my analysis and prescription and indicated intention begin this operation soonest.</p>
                        <p>Plan to see <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> if possible today.</p>

Unfortunately, the local <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> security forces will not be in a position to handle the security job effectively before September, 1966. The problem—to delay independence (not likely) or to keep the British troops in place after independence.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Del</persName> said that the British have not yet made a firm decision on this matter and that we might be able to convince them to keep troops in <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> after independence.

                                    <hi rend="italic">East Indians</hi>—<persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Del</persName> said that we are so far getting nowhere with respect to building up an alternative East Indian party. He went on to say, however, that the situation is still very fluid and that we should probably wait until after independence before we get to work on this problem in earnest. The big hope is that we can locate an alternative East Indian leader; so far no one of any stature appears to be on the horizon. A lesser hope is that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> will, by sensible and progressive policies, be able to win the East Indians over to his side. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>, however, is not at all confident that he can ever translate East Indian acceptance of his regime into East Indian votes. Neither is <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Del</persName>.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Del</persName> added that even if the East Indians cannot be wooed away from <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> will probably do whatever is necessary to win <pb n="919" xml:id="pg_919" facs="0954"/>the election in 1968. This could take the form of importing Negroes from other Caribbean countries or, in a pinch, establishing literacy tests for Guianese voters. Literacy tests would hurt the East Indian population more than the Negro population.</p>

                        <p>The Colonial Secretary said he believed <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> would attend the Constitutional Conference scheduled to begin in London on November 2 although they would probably walk out at some point in the proceedings. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Greenwood</persName> expressed satisfaction with the <pb n="920" xml:id="pg_920" facs="0955"/>course of developments in British Guiana during the past year under <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs leadership. He also expressed an optimistic view of the Conference prospects and satisfaction that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> is prepared to accept the recommendations in the report of the International Commission of Jurists. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Greenwood</persName> said this was not easy for <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> to do, but it should be a helpful gesture on the eve of the Constitutional Conference.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed concern at the security situation in British Guiana following independence and asked if it would be possible for the UK to leave some military forces after independence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Greenwood</persName> replied that in view of our concern<note n="2" xml:id="d416fn2">In a meeting later that day at the White House with <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Chase</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Greenwood</persName> said that to shorten the gap between independence and the readiness of local security forces the British would delay independence until June or July and institute a phased withdrawal of British troops. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> expressed continuing Presidential interest in British Guiana. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Greenwood</persName> complimented <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> on the U.S. Consul General in Georgetown. <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Bundy</persName> responded “we have taken particular pains in our selection of personnel for all agencies operating in British Guiana.” (Memorandum of conversation, October 18; Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File, British Guiana, Vol. III, Memos, 12/63–7/64)</note> he would be prepared to recommend retention of British forces for a limited period of time after independence.<note n="3" xml:id="d416fn3">At a meeting on November 27 <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that the British Cabinet, acting upon <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Greenwood</persName>ʼs recommendation, had decided to allow British troops to remain in British Guiana after independence on May 26, 1966, until October 1966 when Guyanese forces would be prepared to assume their responsibilities. (Memorandum of conversation, November 27; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, DEF 6 UK)</note> He stressed that there was no precedent for doing so. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Greenwood</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> was being pressed to get on with the creation of local security forces, but it would be a year from now before such forces would be able to take on the job of security. While <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> was asking for independence in February, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Greenwood</persName> thought June or July would be more realistic. The Colonial Secretary added that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> is agreeable to British forces staying on for a period after independence.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretaryʼs question about the Venezuelan claim Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Greenwood</persName> said the claim was without a sound legal basis and for that reason Venezuela would be uninterested in referring the dispute to the International Court. The Secretary expressed the hope the matter could be resolved before independence since otherwise the existence of the dispute would constitute a bar to membership for Guiana in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. The Secretary asked whether there was any possibility of minor border adjustments. Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Greenwood</persName> and Mr. Wallace replied that any territorial concession to Venezuela would be exploited by <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> against <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>.</p>

                        <p>The Colonial Secretary in the course of the conversation described <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> as a “good Prime Minister” whose performance has been above expectations. He suggested that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> has made some progress in reassuring the small, well-to-do Indian business community and noted that return of Indians to areas which they had left during the racial disturbances. The Colonial Secretaryʼs references to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> were unsympathetic. He believes <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs position has deteriorated in the past year as his party has suffered from internal differences.</p>

                            <item>The British Guiana Independence Conference concluded in London on 19 November 1965 by setting the date of 26 May 1966 for the independence of what will be known as the state of Guyana. The conference also produced agreement on a draft constitution for the new state and stipulations in the conference record for consultations between the leaders of the two parties in the coalition government. A number of compromises were worked out between Premier <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Forbes Burnham</persName> and Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName> which, hopefully, will ease some of the strains between them. The conference did not, however, succeed in bringing the two leaders much closer together; they remain basically incompatible on both personal and political grounds and are united only in mutual defense against the threat posed by <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName>.</item>

[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] informally indicated that the British Government was alert to the possibility of racial violence breaking out following independence and would continue to be sensitive to any developments which might bring into question the good judgement of the British Government in granting independence to a government led by a representative of a minority racial grouping in the circumstances now prevailing in British Guiana.</item>

                            <item>Apart from the conference, the British Government and Premier <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> made some progress in negotiating other agreements, primarily with respect to the internal security of the country. The British have agreed to maintain troops in Guyana until the end of October 1966 and to train and provide a cadre for the newly formed Guyana Defense Force. This force and the augmented Guyana police forces are to be brought to a sufficient level of capability to permit the withdrawal of British troops in October 1966. The adequacy of this solution cannot be judged at this time.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Forbes Burnham</persName> stated that his immediate objective is to launch his economic development plan so that he will be able to induce large numbers of West Indians of African descent to settle in Guyana prior to the December 1968 elections. His purpose is radically to alter the racial balance now existing in the electorate in sufficient time to enable him to win a plurality in the 1968 elections. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> stated that he will seek aid from both the British and American Governments for this purpose. He said further that he was confident his scheme was feasible and that it was the only possible course of action which would prevent <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> returning to power with the support of the Indian community.</item>

                            <label>A.</label>
                            <item>British Guiana will probably make a relatively smooth transition to independence, but racial suspicions between East Indians and Negroes will continue to dominate Guyanese politics.</item>
                            <label>B.</label>
                            <item>When (or whether) these tensions break out again into violence will depend in large measure on the conduct of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Forbes Burnham</persName>, leader of the Negro party (the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>), and of <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName>, leader of the East Indian party (the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>). For over a year, <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> has governed with considerable restraint and <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> has refrained from violent opposition. But new elections are due by late 1968, and between now and then tensions will rise and may at some point get out of hand.</item>
                            <label>C.</label>
                            <item>Even after British troops depart in October 1966, Guyanese security forces can probably cope with sporadic violence. If violence got out of control, <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> would probably call for a return of British troops. If <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> consent were forthcoming and British troops were available, we believe that London would comply.</item>
                            <label>D.</label>
                            <item>The governing coalition of <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>, a professed but pragmatic socialist, and the conservative United Force leader, <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName>, will continue to be a tenuous one. Friction between the partners over patronage and fiscal issues will probably be intensified after independence, but chances are that a common fear of <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> will hold the coalition together.</item>
                            <label>E.</label>
                            <item>Guyanaʼs economy will need substantial foreign capital, much of it from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. The need for aid will keep <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> on tolerable terms with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, UK, and Canada, though his administration will incline toward a neutralist posture in foreign affairs. If <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> came <pb n="924" xml:id="pg_924" facs="0959"/>to power, he could, because of his Marxist sympathies and his connections in Communist countries, count on some help from these countries. However, they probably would furnish only token quantities of aid.</item>

The few <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> leaders who oppose <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> also realize that the mass of party supporters are likely to favor <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> over them in any open contest.</item>

                            <item>As sobering as the foregoing observations may be, the seemingly solid East Indian, <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>-built wall must inevitably develop some cracks. There are a few indications that economic improvement, especially the road program, is making a favorable impression on some East Indians. It is too early to tell how significant this may be. The following proposals are of the type which seem best designed to hasten the development of East Indian disaffection from <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>, enhance the position of the government and provide a much-needed assist to the economy of the country—which if not improved can only further complicate the political situation:

Such assistance might include establishment of a credit union to assist the predominantly East Indian <gloss target="#t_MPCA1">MPCA</gloss>-affiliated worker to satisfy his basic needs. Obviously, it would enhance the position of the <gloss target="#t_MPCA1">MPCA</gloss> and weaken its arch rival, the Guyana Agricultural Workersʼ Union—<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs principal pirate labor arm. Most important, it would give the East Indian tangible evidence that his individual lot was being improved under the government, actively assisted by the U.S.</item>

(At the present time, the prospects in this area are not particularly encouraging. The anti-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> East Indian Justice Party and the Guyana United Muslim Party have been discredited, and consequently offer little, if any, hope of being able to contribute substantially to any future anti-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> effort. However, if nothing new appears before 1968, and there is reason to believe that these basically defunct organizations can still play a useful role, consideration should be given at that time to pumping new blood into their emaciated bodies.

                            <item>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> is reasonably convinced that West Indian (Negro) immigration might well solve his electoral problem. More objective observers tend to be more skeptical, primarily because there is not enough time before the next election. While there is no doubt that additional human resources will be required to subdue the extensive Guyana wilderness, with local unemployment still high (at least 15 percent of the total work force) it would seem that immigration cannot proceed in the next year or so at an inordinate rate. The East Indians are, understandably, solidly against this migration scheme and many of <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs supporters will oppose it unless they first have jobs. As a short term election device, immigration does not seem to be very practical. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> might easily lose more supporters from within than he hopes to gain from without—particularly if he immediately pushes for the fifteen-twenty thousand immigrants he has in mind.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> is pressing for some type of Caribbean grouping and envisions himself as a likely leader of whatever might emerge. Also, he has entertained the possibility of putting together some form of unitary state with Barbados or Antigua, or one or several of the smaller islands. (<persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> told the U.S. Ambassador on July 4th that Grenada and St. Lucia had recently expressed an interest in merging with <pb n="928" xml:id="pg_928" facs="0963"/>Guyana.) This plan might prove workable, but again there is no assurance that anything will materialize within the next two to three years. Arrangements of this nature, obviously, cannot be unduly pushed; but they should certainly be discreetly encouraged where possible.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Best estimates available indicate that the domestic non-East Indian voting population in 1968–69 will still exceed the East Indian electorate by five to eight thousand. No provision is made in these estimates for new immigrants. Absentee voters probably number between ten and fifteen thousand, with the non-East Indian in the majority. Balanced against this apparent margin in favor of the government, is the fact that the government could easily lose the votes of as many as ten thousand of its nominal supporters. They would be the dissatisfied and the disgruntled who might well refuse to go to the polls or in some cases conceivably even vote for the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>. Facing a contest such as this, a man as astute as <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>, will probably want to enter the game with at least a few extra aces. (In 1964 the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> received 109,000 votes; the coalition parties a total of 126,000; the total vote was 238,530 out of 247,495 registered, the projected registration in 1968–69 is estimated at 284,387.)</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> is not considering calling an election before 1968, and apparently there is no great advantage in doing so. Prior to that time, he will not be able to demonstrate major accomplishments, such as substantially reducing unemployment, etc. In short, he can probably afford to give <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> a few more votes conceivably by virtue of the greater numbers of East Indians who will have arrived at the voting age by 1968, in the hope that by waiting, he, <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> can not only better satisfy his own supporters but hopefully wean away a few of the East Indian voters.</item>

However, if necessary, he is prepared to employ unorthodox methods to achieve his aims. In these circumstances, probably the best that can be hoped for at this time, is that he might respond to guideline and thus take the most effective and least objectionable course to attain his goals.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is established U.S. Government policy that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName>, East Indian Marxist leader of the pro-Communist Peopleʼs Progressive Party (<gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>) in Guyana, will not be permitted to take over the government of an independent Guyana. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> has the electoral support of the East Indians, who are approximately 50% of the total population of Guyana. It is believed that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> has a good chance of coming to power in the <pb n="931" xml:id="pg_931" facs="0966"/>next elections unless steps are taken to prevent this. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Forbes Burnham</persName>, leader of the majority Peopleʼs National Congress (<gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>) in the coalition, is aware of the problem, and has stated that he is fully prepared to utilize the electoral machinery at his disposal to ensure his own re-election. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> has initiated steps for electoral registration of Guyanese at home and abroad,<note n="2" xml:id="d421fn2">In a meeting [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] on September 16, 1966, <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> requested money for various political purposes and outlined his plans to issue identification cards to all Guyanans above the age of 10, and to identify and register all Guyanans of African ancestry in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States in order to get their absentee votes in the next elections. “Conversely, <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> acknowledged with a smile, East Indians living abroad may have trouble getting registered and, if registered, getting ballots.” (Ibid., [<hi rend="italic">file name not declassified</hi>] Telegrams and Reports, 1965)</note> and has requested financial assistance [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] for the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> campaign. It is recommended that he and his party be provided with covert support in order to assure his victory at the polls. At the same time, it is believed that support to <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName> and his United Force (<gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss>), the minority party in the coalition government, is also essential in order to offset <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs solidly entrenched East Indian electoral support.

                                <p>Under the Guyana Constitution, new elections for the National Assembly must take place prior to 31 March 1969, and can take place at any time should the Prime Minister bring about the dissolution of the Parliament.</p>
                                <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Forbes Burnham</persName> of Guyana is aware that the U.S. Government is opposed to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName>ʼs assumption of power in Guyana. He is also acutely conscious of the racial factors in the country which work to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs advantage, and he realizes that he must immediately initiate a vigorous campaign if he is to defeat <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> has personally undertaken the task of reorganizing the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>, which has not functioned in many areas since the last elections. <pb n="932" xml:id="pg_932" facs="0967"/>He plans to establish campaign headquarters in Georgetown and other urban areas where the African vote is concentrated, and will also send organizers throughout Guyana to re-enlist <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> supporters who have been inactive in party affairs since the last elections. At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> is sending a trusted political adviser abroad to survey the potential absentee vote which he can expect from Guyanese residing in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and the West Indies.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> believes that he would have great difficulty ensuring his own re-election without support from the U.S. Government. He has requested financial support [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] for staff and campaign expenses, motor vehicles, small boats, printing equipment, and transistorized public address systems. He also wishes to contract for the services of an American public relations firm to improve his image abroad and counteract <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs propaganda in the foreign press.</p>
                                <p>Since we believe that there is a good likelihood that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> can be elected in Guyana unless the entire non-East Indian electorate is mobilized against him, we also believe that campaign support must be provided to <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName>, the head of the United Force (<gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss>) and <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs coalition partner.</p>

                                <p>The U.S. Government determined in 1962 that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName> would not be acceptable as the head of government in an independent Guyana. When elections were scheduled for December 1964, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] was instructed to ensure <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs defeat by the provision of guidance and support to <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>, leaders of Guyanaʼs two anti-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> political parties. This was accomplished. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> established a coalition government which is now in power. This is, however, an uneasy arrangement and <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> desires a <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> majority in the Assembly to result from the forthcoming election. While we are not yet persuaded that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs objective is feasible, we believe it is essential that he wage a vigorous campaign against <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> from this moment on.</p>

[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] financial support to the British Guiana Trades Union Council during the strikes of 1962 and 1963 was approved. The Special Group did not approve other political action against <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> during that period because of British Government concern. Since early 1963, political action operations in Guyana have not been the subject of Special Group consideration.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> has consistently and publicly accused the U.S. and U.K. Governments of having undermined him and of having aided <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>. It is expected that he will continue to reiterate these charges and to accuse the U.S. and U.K. of supporting <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>, regardless of what course of action <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> may follow. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> has cried wolf so often in the past that a reiteration of the same charges is not expected to carry much impact, particularly if the timing of the operation is handled appropriately. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> is thinking of utilizing voting machines in certain districts in Guyana, knowing that this will attract <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs attention and lead to charges of fraud. Since <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> does not intend to rig the machines, and the tallies will in fact be accurate, he believes this will not only divert <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs attention during the election campaign but will add credibility to the results after the fact.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> has been made aware that the U.S. Government will attach the utmost importance to tight security practices in the event that support is provided to him as proposed in this paper. He recognizes that any exposure of this support will reflect on him as well as on the U.S. Government, and he is prepared to deny receipt of any such aid. American and British press coverage of the 1968 elections must be expected to be relatively intensive, and it is likely that some British and American correspondents may be favorably predisposed to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>. For this reason, it will be essential that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> not only counter <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs assertion that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> represents a minority of the electorate, but also that the U.S. Governmentʼs involvement not be revealed in any way. Recent publicity resulting from the <hi rend="italic">Ramparts</hi> exposures had led to charges in the press that AFL/CIO assistance to the British Guiana Trades Union Council during the general strike of 1964 was in fact <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                                    <pb n="934" xml:id="pg_934" facs="0969"/>action and overthrew the <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> government. There has been no allegation in the aftermath of the <hi rend="italic">Ramparts</hi> exposures that the U.S. Government was involved in the December 1964 election. Therefore, it is believed that since the AFL/CIO is not involved in this proposed course of action in any way, and since there has been no exposure of U.S. Government involvement in the 1964 elections, necessary risks involved in the proposed course of action can be undertaken with appropriate safeguards.</p>
                                <p>The present security forces in Guyana are considered adequate to contain limited or sporadic violence. However, should <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> resort to large-scale violence such as occurred during the 1962–64 period, the present security forces would not be adequate. If this should occur, it is problematical as to whether the U.K. could be persuaded to send in British troops, even if <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> so requested. In any event, the British would have difficulties in sea-lift and logistical support.</p>

                                <p>In recent months various methods for dealing with the <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> problem have been considered by the Department of State [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], and discussed with representatives of the British Government. The proposed course of action outlined in this paper is believed to represent the most desirable course of action under current circumstances. Should it appear, as the election campaign develops, that this proposed course of action is not sufficient, other actions may become necessary to supplement this proposal. Whichever courses of action are pursued, it is believed necessary that we anticipate that elections will be held in Guyana no later than March 1969 and support to <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> for the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> and to <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> for the <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> is essential in any case.

                            <item>In course discussion with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> last night I raised subject coming elections and explained election mathematics at my disposal tended show that the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> majority over the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> and the U.F. would require at minimum 60,000 votes additional. Even Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> does not consider that overseas vote can be blown up to that extent; even 50,000 figure used by him very hypothetically and 30,000 accepted as more realistic (Embassy finds in excess of 25,000 not believable). Earlier Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> said that overseas vote figures could be manipulated pretty much as he wished and he tentatively had in mind say 25,000 for a new coalition government and 5,000 for the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>. When pressed by these mathematics, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> said he “would not break his lance” over the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> majority, meaning that if the U.S.G. made issue of it he would not pursue it. Clear however he intends to follow number of election tricks to add to the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> totals and detract from the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> votes. Accumulated total of these may well produce a surprisingly good showing for the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>, though falling short of absolute majority. Adds that he well aware of need that these election tricks be done smoothly and without controversy.</item>

                            <item>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> appreciated point of view that motive behind his pining for majority lies in great part in difficulties doing business with Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName>. I suggested that solution this problem lay less in engineered majority than it did in arranging for <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>ʼs honorable withdrawal from politics and government after the election is won and a new coalition government formed. <pb n="936" xml:id="pg_936" facs="0971"/>Observed <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> would have much less trouble with remaining U.F. officials. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> receptive to idea but saw no U.F. official on horizon who could take over.

                        <p>There follows a review of recent 303 Committee actions on Guyana. It provides operational background that you may find of use in your review of <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 87.2–67.<note n="2" xml:id="d423fn2">
                                <ref target="#d424">Document 424</ref>.</note> 303 Committee action has been predicated on the assumption that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> is a Communist or an accurate facsimile of one, and that his becoming Prime Minister of Guyana would be disastrous for Guyana, would prove a dangerous stimulus to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Castro</persName>, and would introduce an unacceptable degree of instability into the Caribbean area.</p>
                        <p>The final paragraph of the Estimate, on the significance of a <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> victory, has therefore attracted a good deal of attention in <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>/DDP as it has gone through its several revisions. In its earlier forms the paragraph reflected a judgment inconsistent with that which motivated the policy decisions of the 303 Committee; in its latest form the inconsistency has considerally diminished. For its part, DDC finds the current version acceptable.</p>
                        <p>On 10 April 1967 the 303 Committee approved a proposal to provide Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Forbes Burnham</persName> of the Guyanan Peopleʼs National Congress with covert support in the next national elections.<note n="3" xml:id="d423fn3">See <ref target="#d421">Document 421</ref>.</note> The cost of the assistance necessary to assure a <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> victory over <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName> of the Peopleʼs Progressive Party was estimated at [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 <pb n="937" xml:id="pg_937" facs="0972"/>line of source text not declassified</hi>]. Some of this was to go to <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs coalition partner, the United Force.</p>
                        <p>Committee approval was grounded in the belief that as Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> would be an instrument of Communist influence in Latin America. The [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] paper embodying the proposal noted that during <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs years (1961–4) as head of the government, some 50 <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> youth trained in Cuba in guerrilla warfare, a “Guyana Liberation Army” was organized and equipped largely with Cuban weapons, and $3,000,000 of Soviet bloc funds entered Guyana for the support of the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d423fn4">Information on Soviet Bloc assistance to <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs government was attached at Tab A; see <ref target="#d421fn4">footnote 4, Document 421</ref>.</note> The paper also stated that some 90 <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> youths were currently being trained (?educated?) in Bloc countries and that in Guyana <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs Accabre College was training Guyanan youth in Marxist thought.</p>
                        <p>The paper forecast that the vote would be an extremely close thing even if <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> had our assistance. The [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] suggestion, adopted by the Committee, was to make 12 equal monthly payments to <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> to help him in revitalizing his party and in organizing his absentee vote strength. If <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs electoral prospects appeared bleak, [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. These measures, it was hoped, would forestall the necessity of exile of <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>, or his detention, or coup dʼétat after the elections.</p>
                        <p>The Committeeʼs approval was attended by a recommendation by the Executive Secretary for a quarterly progress report on the progress of the campaign. On 7 August [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] reported to the 303 Committee that some [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] of the original sum had been committed, that a [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. In oral presentation an [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] representative noted that the vote might go as high as 350,000 (instead of the 278,000 previously predicted) and that the increase was expected to be largely Indian and therefore pro-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d423fn5">The minutes of the meeting of the 303 Committee of August 7 reported [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] the estimated voting figures.

The [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] disposition at the moment, and that of <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>, is to continue to rely on the electoral process in Guyana (no matter how much that process will need “adjustment”), [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].

                        <p>On the Guyanese elections the Prime Minister thought he would have to go to elections by November 1968. He said he was “calmly confident” about the outcome. The President stressed the importance of maintaining his coalition strong.<note n="2" xml:id="d426fn2">A January 20 memorandum for the President from <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> noted that Guyanaʼs uneasy coalition partnership had become shaky over appointments and budgetary issues and stressed that “a word from you on the importance of maintaining uneasy political combinations in election years would be useful.” (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File, Guyana (Brit.

                        <p>The Prime Minister described his border difficulties with Venezuela during the past year. He referred to Venezuelaʼs having blocked Guyana from eligibility to sign the Latin American Nuclear Free Zone Treaty at the UN last session.<note n="3" xml:id="d426fn3">The Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America was signed at Mexico City on February 14, 1967, and entered into force on April 22, 1968.

                        <p>Following his release from a physical check-up at Bethesda Naval Hospital, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> paid a 45-minute courtesy call on the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>After an exchange of pleasantries, the Secretary asked the Prime Minister how he saw the situation in Guyana. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> replied that he was “quietly confident” about the outcome of the elections, which could be held at any time before the end of March 1969. Amplifying on this at a later stage in the conversation, he said he thought that the government had picked up support and that, while it would be untruthful to suggest that there was a landslide of defectors from the P.P.P., there were some who had gone over to the government in some areas. He might pick up 3% to 4% of the East Indian vote. He was also counting “heavily” on the overseas absentee ballots, which were concentrated in the U.K. and, secondly, in the U.S. He said that last yearʼs U.S. Supreme Court decision which had the effect of allowing Guyanese citizens who had also become naturalized U.S. citizens to vote without losing their U.S. citizenship would be helpful. The Secretary expressed some uncertainty whether the decision contemplated voting by such citizens while they were resident in the U.S. and whether electioneering in this country would present problems. He said we would look into this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> indicated that no <pb n="944" xml:id="pg_944" facs="0979"/>objectionable electioneering was contemplated and, in substantiation of his assessment that his electoral prospects were good, pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName> was already setting the stage among his followers for a defeat by claiming the elections would be rigged, he would not be allowed to assume power, etc.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister alluded to the border dispute with Surinam which had flared up before his departure and reported that, in the interval, Sir Lionel Luckhoo, the Guyana High Commissioner in London, had taken the matter up in the Hague with the Foreign Minister when he was presenting his credentials as Ambassador to the Netherlands. Sir Lionel was in the process of returning to report in detail, but he had gained the impression that the Netherlands was not backing the Government of Surinam and that the matter could be settled quietly.</p>
                        <p>The border dispute with Venezuela was more worrisome, especially as it was also an election year in Venezuela with the consequent temptation to agitate the issue. The saving factor grace was the Venezuelans were pledged not to use force and that they seemed to realize the problems which would result from a hostile government on <pb n="945" xml:id="pg_945" facs="0980"/>their frontiers. The Mixed Commission was now working satisfactorily (except that the Ankoko Island question remained unsolved)<note n="2" xml:id="d428fn2">In 1966 Venezuela moved to occupy the tiny border island of Ankoko, half of which was claimed by Guyana, according to a background paper attached to a January 22 briefing memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_SRM1">Sayre</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> (see <ref target="#d427fn1">footnote 1, Document 427</ref>). That paper also described how Venezuela had “effectively blocked Guyana from becoming a party to the Organization of American States by the Act of Washington which bars admission to American States that have unresolved border disputes with a member state.”</note> and it was setting up a Sub-committee to look into economic cooperation. Guyana appreciated the efforts that the U.S. had been making to keep matters cool on the Venezuelan side and was counting on the U.S. to continue those efforts, as the Opposition in Guyana was only too anxious to cry “sell out” at any sign of failure to maintain the nationʼs sovereignty. The Secretary commented that border issues were often agitated in political situations but that it was contrary to Venezuelaʼs traditions and objectives in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and UN to settle matters by force. He remarked that, in the 40 or so border disputes around the world, it was our observation that those in possession seemed to win out and that the thing to do was for all to remain cool.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary invited the Prime Minister to take five minutes or so to say frankly what he thought the U.S. should be doing in Guyana. The Prime Minister noted with appreciation that the U.S. had been in the forefront of contributors of assistance to his development effort but that, as he had indicated at the Donorʼs Conference in Georgetown, his principal problem had been to raise sufficient local currency financing to make use of the external financing offered. In fact, part of last yearʼs British assistance had to be foregone because local cost financing could not be raised. He understood the Congressional and U.S. balance of payments considerations which put constraints on U.S. assistance for local costs, but it would be useful to have the utmost flexibility in this regard. Meanwhile, he had been exploring with the U.S. the possibility of a <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 program (for instance, Guyana was importing $15 million or more in U.S. wheat) which would provide counterpart which could be used for local cost purposes. The Secretary indicated sympathy with regard to the local cost financing problem, which emanated from our balance of payments, and with regard to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480. He indicated he would want to take up the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 problem with Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_HJCJ1">Hill</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SRM1">Sayre</persName> later. There followed a brief discussion of the recent U.S. balance of payments problems, in which the Secretary emphasized the effort which had been taken to avoid an adverse impact on investments in and trade with the less developed countries.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>During Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs call he asked for our help in persuading Venezuela to be less “bellicose” about the border dispute. You asked for a memorandum.<note n="2" xml:id="d430fn2">See <ref target="#d426">Document 426</ref>.</note>

                        <pb n="947" xml:id="pg_947" facs="0982"/>
                        <p>The dispute, involving some 5/8 of Guyana (see attached map),<note n="3" xml:id="d430fn3">Attached but not reproduced.</note> goes back to colonial times. We became involved in the 1890s in an arbitration effort between the British and Venezuelans. The award generally corresponds to Guyanaʼs present boundaries. Venezuela has never accepted it.</p>
                        <p>Venezuela allowed the case to lie dormant until Guyana approached independence. Thinking that it could get more concessions out of a Britain anxious to get rid of a problem colony than an independent new nation, the Venezuelans began agitating their claim. They blocked Guyana from joining the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and becoming part of the Latin American Nuclear Free Zone.</p>
                        <p>In 1966 at Geneva the British and Venezuelan Governments agreed to establish a Mixed Guyana–Venezuela Commission to discuss the dispute. The agreement provides that if the dispute has not been resolved by 1970, the Commission will be dissolved and the problem taken to the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>The Commission has not made any progress toward resolving the boundary question but it has succeeded in draining off some of the political heat. Last year there was a small flareup when Venezuela occupied the border island of Ankoko, half of which is claimed by Guyana.</p>
                        <p>We have made it clear to both governments that they should use the Mixed Commission to work out their differences. We follow the controversy closely and counsel restraint when things get unsettled. After the Ankoko incident interrupted the dialogue, we encouraged President Leoni to receive an emissary from Guyana to resume bilateral talks. Venezuela eventually agreed to this, and offered to consider joint economic development projects in Guyana under the aegis of the Mixed Commission. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> accepted this suggestion in the understanding that the projects would not be limited just to the disputed territory.</p>
                        <p>The prospects for reaching a solution to the border controversy in the near future are not bright, unless there is a sharp change in attitude by the Venezuelans. For internal political reasons, they now find it convenient to agitate the issue from time to time. Our strategy is to use our influence to restrain the Venezuelans from further adventurism along the frontier and from too much politicking at home. We have repeatedly reminded the Venezuelans that if they undermine <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>, they run the risk of getting a communist bridgehead at their back door under <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName>.</p>

                            <item>Electoral Assistance to Guyanan Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>—Progress Report</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Attached is a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] memorandum of 22 January<note n="2" xml:id="d431fn2">The attached memorandum reported that the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> claimed to already have 20,000 overseas Guyanese registered, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], and that, “according [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>],” <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi</persName> and Janet <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> and a small hard-core group of Marxists around them had purged the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> of the majority of its moderate leaders at the party congress in late August 1967.</note> reporting the progress that has been made in putting into effect the 303 Committeeʼs decision of April 1967 to provide anti-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> forces in Guyana with covert support for the next national elections, which are scheduled for late 1968 or early 1969. The bulk of the assistance, whose total cost was estimated at [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], was to go to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Forbes Burnham</persName> of the Peoples National Congress (<gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>); a lesser amount was to go to the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>ʼs junior partner in the government coalition, the United Force (<gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>The Committeeʼs decision was grounded in the belief that as Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> would be an instrument of Communist influence in Latin America. He is a declared Marxist, and during his years as head of government in 1961–64 demonstrated in a number of ways his close sympathy with both the Soviet Union and Cuba. The [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] memorandum of proposal that formed the basis of the Committeeʼs April decision pointed out that in these years some 50 members of his Peopleʼs Progressive Party (<gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>) were trained in guerrilla warfare in Cuba; that some 90 <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> youths were currently being educated in Bloc countries; that the Soviet Union during <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs premiership had given over $3,000,000 in direct support of the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>; and that <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs Accabre College, which he established in Guyana in 1965, is a base for Marxist indoctrination of <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> members.</p>
                        <p>The attached memorandum notes a number of steps that have been taken to implement the 303 Committee decision. A <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> training program in organizational and campaign techniques is in progress [<hi rend="italic">4 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] to publicize Guyanaʼs progress and thus attract the maximum number of these voters.</p>
                        <pb n="949" xml:id="pg_949" facs="0984"/>
                        <p>A nation-wide registration of all Guyanese over 15 has been all but completed; the information it yields will be helpful in indicating likely areas and groups for <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> campaign effort. For its part, the <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> has begun working in both urban and rural areas and among its potential supporters in American Indian settlements. Of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] originally authorized, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] was committed in FY ʼ67. Of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] programmed for FY 1968 only [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] has been committed thus far, but the report anticipates an early quickening in the pace of outlays.</p>
                        <p>Despite these endeavors, the election still promises to be a nip-and-tuck affair. The countryʼs vote will once more be cast almost completely along ethnic lines, and there is no solid assurance that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs Negro supporters, even with their strength supplemented by their overseas compatriots, will carry the day against the East Indian supporters of <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>. The feasibility of <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs design to effect a preelection merger with St. Vincent and thus take advantage of that islandʼs largely Negro vote is still uncertain. Guyanaʼs border problems with Venezuela and Surinam are being vigorously exploited by <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>, as are charges that the United States, and especially the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, is involving itself in Guyanaʼs internal affairs.<note n="3" xml:id="d431fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> charged that the Shoup Registration System International of Pennsylvania was a front for the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and would help with the rigging of the coming elections, according to a December 17, 1967, <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> article, a copy of which was attached but not printed.</note> But although prospects are thus unclear, they are bright enough to justify keeping to our present course.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that the attached memorandum be noted in the next 303 Committee meeting.</p>

                        <p>Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> met with Guyana Deputy Prime Minister/Minister of Finance Dr. Ptolemy Reid on May 24, 1968. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>ʼs primary purpose in coming to the United States was to generate electoral support for the Peopleʼs National Congress (<gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>) among Guyanese living in the United States. <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName> took over as Minister of Finance from United Force leader, <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName>, in late September 1967, after the latterʼs resignation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> estimated that <persName corresp="#p_RCD1">Reid</persName>
                            <pb n="950" xml:id="pg_950" facs="0985"/>would assume the leadership of the anti-<persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> forces in Guyana in the event of <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs death or incapacitation.

                        <p>Reid had progressively assumed more responsibility for economic development matters in Guyana and his visit occasioned a review of the U.S. aid program in Guyana. The briefing memoranda prepared for his visit reported that the U.S. Agency for International Development (<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>) program in Guyana “has been progressing well with inputs of grants, loans, and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 foods of roughly $10 million per year since the <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> government took office in December 1964.” These memoranda stated that substantial improvements had been made in the main coast road, and that Morrison-Knudson was preparing to begin work on the last remaining unimproved coastal road section, around Corentyne in the eastern part of the country, financed by a $7.5 million <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> loan. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_OCT1">Oliver</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, May 24, Tab B—Briefing Notes; ibid.) Another <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> project was the building of a 50-mile road from Atkinson Field to the previously isolated mining town of Mackenzie, begun in 1966 and finished the summer of 1968. Major improvements were made through <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds to the international airport developed at Atkinson Field. An <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> loan was also planned for Guyanaʼs rice industry, to construct drying/storage centers at a number of sites along the coastal rice growing areas, to modernize Guyanese rice mills, to establish a rice research station, and to provide technical assistance. The loan was approved in November of 1968; see <ref target="#d440">Document 440</ref>.</p>

                                <p>The Government of Guyana is carrying out a census of all citizens 14 years of age and over who reside in Guyana. The names of Guyanese of voting age will be drawn from the census list to compose the voter registration lists for the elections. All three parties, the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> and the Peoples Progressive Party (<gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>) led by <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName>, are now working to make sure that their adherents are properly registered. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] The Government of Guyana at one time planned to have the census completed in early 1968; however <pb n="953" xml:id="pg_953" facs="0988"/>various delays have occurred and the government recently said privately that the census will not be completed until the end of July, at which time registration will be closed. Due to these delays, the governmentʼs contract with the company expired, company representatives who were in Guyana returned to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, and Guyanese are completing the census without the companyʼs help. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> recently said that he believes the registration can be completed in time to permit elections to be held in early December 1968 but that there is a possibility that they may not be held until February 1969. According to the constitution, elections must be held by the end of March 1969.</p>

                                <p>The main thrust of present <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> efforts overseas is to get potential voters registered. This will be strictly a registration of voters as no census is being conducted in overseas areas. This registration effort is going slowly but reasonably satisfactorily in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Great Britain but has run into snags in Canada. Steps are being taken to correct this problem. It is difficult to estimate what the total number of overseas registrants will be as there are no figures to be used as a basis for such an estimate. There may be as many as 20,000 potential voters in Great Britain and possibly 15,000 in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Canada. As many as 25,000 of these may be supporters of the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] representatives met with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Forbes Burnham</persName> in late April to discuss operational matters related to the electoral campaign. At this meeting <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> stated unequivocally that he plans to conduct the registration and voting in such a manner that the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> will emerge with an absolute majority in the Guyana National Assembly. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> said that he will never again allow the life of his government to depend upon his coalition partner <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName> and that if the voting should turn out in such a manner that he could not form a government without the help of <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName>, he would refuse to form a government. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> said that he plans to register 17, 18, 19 and 20 year old <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> adherents (minimum voting age is 21 years) to make up part of the vote he needs and will direct his campaign in such a way as to attract enough additional East Indian voters to put the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> approximately on a par with the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> in Guyana. The additional votes he would need to give the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> an absolute majority would come from the overseas Guyanese. On the other hand Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] in Georgetown have commented that they believe this is wishful thinking by <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>. They believe <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> would encounter insurmountable administrative and organizational difficulties <pb n="954" xml:id="pg_954" facs="0989"/>in attempting to rig the elections to the extent necessary to assure the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> an absolute majority.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs plans to get an absolute majority in the elections constitute a basic change in strategy. Planning heretofore had been based upon the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> running separately but re-forming the coalition after the elections. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> will probably still be willing to have a coalition government after the elections but wants an absolute majority so that the coalition will be formed on his terms and so that the life of his government will not depend on the <gloss target="#t_UF1">UF</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName>.</p>

                        <p>We recommend that you authorize us to negotiate a <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 sales agreement with Guyana to provide approximately 1,500 tons of edible vegetable oil, 2,000 tons of wheat/wheat flour, 100 tons of tobacco and 3,000 tons of potatoes for which the current export market value (including applicable ocean transportation costs) is approximately $1.0 million. The proposed terms are payment in dollars of 5 percent on delivery and the balance in approximately equal installments over 20 years; interest will be 2 percent per annum during a two-year grace period and 2.5 percent thereafter. The Departments of State and Treasury concur in this recommendation.</p>

                        <p>The Guyana (<persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>) Government has undertaken with help from the United States Agency for International Development and the British and Canadian Governments an ambitious economic development program over the past three years. We have given particular priority to assisting this government in its effort to demonstrate what a democratic government can achieve following the years of difficulties under the rule of communist-oriented <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName>. The <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> government is making a special effort to accelerate its development projects, particularly for agriculture, but local currency costs for development have placed a substantial strain on the <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> governmentʼs budget.</p>
                        <p>This agreement would assist the <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> Government to sustain its record of economic achievement and progress, which is important at this time since national elections will be held in Guyana prior to March 31, 1969, with <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> again opposing <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>.</p>

                            <item>I first touched on status of possibility <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss> loan,<note n="3" xml:id="d435fn3">Supporting Assistance loan, which could provide over $2 million for small public works projects, reducing unemployment and resulting in maximum political impact during the pre-election period. In a June 28 telegram [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], on <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName>ʼs behalf, requested [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] immediate intercession, since the loan agreement had to be signed prior to the end of the fiscal year (June 30) and <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> was reluctant to proceed. <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> planned a direct appeal to the Secretary of State “if dayʼs events require,” but the loan was approved without this proving necessary. (Ibid.)</note> mentioning that while great progress had been made toward authorization and I was hopeful, it was at the moment still not certain. There was, however, another matter involved in this which was of concern to me. Some of the friends of Guyana in Washington had recently become apprehensive as to whether Prime Minister might plan Tammany Hall tactics on so <pb n="957" xml:id="pg_957" facs="0992"/>massive a scale as to taint the results, raise questions of legitimacy, and embarrass the U.S. I was sure that he would no more want to have us all in the funny papers than would our friends in Washington. I said I assumed that Sonny Ramphal had already mentioned to him that <persName corresp="#p_HJCJ1">John Hill</persName> has expressed this anxiety to Ramphal in New York. In addition, an ingredient in the discussion in Washington of my request for <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss> funding had been question as to whether election was to be so fixed as to make such funding unnecessary thereby saving <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> several million dollars. (<persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> seemed impressed by this point.) Moreover because of our strong support of the <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> administration in the past, which was well known, and the closeness of GOG–<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> relations what he does will inevitably affect our image too.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> asked what these people thought was reasonable and I told him the matter was not one of any precise equation but simply one of dimension. We wanted him to win; we had backed him to the hilt; neither of us wanted a scandal. He agreed. I asked him what he really expected electorally. He said he foresaw the <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> in about the same range of votes in Guyana as the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>; i.e., roughly even, perhaps not quite as much as the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>, or perhaps slightly more but in general about the same order of magnitude. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> told me he expects work hard on Muslims and hopes have some success as well as with various other non-Africans so as to give <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss> more multi-racial image. He hoped part of this process could take place before election and mentioned various individuals including Kit Nascimento and Ann Jardim.</item>

                            <item>As far as overseas was concerned, he thought registration of as many as 50,000 was within realm of possibility because of ease with which persons can qualify as Guyanese, i.e., descendant if mother was Guyanese and even foreign wives of Guyanese under the law qualify. He was urging his agents to work vigorously toward this large registration but he thought prospect was not good for high voter participation overseas. He expected not more than about 30,000 to vote if registration went high as 50,000. We agreed that overseas vote should be heavily <gloss target="#t_PNC1">PNC</gloss>, i.e., 75–90% (with him more inclined to the latter figure).

                            <item>Since all indications from collateral reporting showed that his intentions were much more reasonable than had been feared this was far as I thought it necessary to go.

                            <item>Background: Dispute originates in 1899 Arbitral Award of territory west of Essequibo River (about five-eighths of what is now Guyana) to Great Britain. GOV has since 1962 maintained officially that arbitral award was result “fraudulent deal” between British and Russian members tribunal and therefore award is null and void. In period immediately prior to British granting independence to Guyana, Venezuela pressed for reopening question of where boundary should lie in belief that Venezuela could more easily twist tail of British lion than of small newly sovereign neighbor. In February 1966 at Geneva UK, British Guiana and Venezuela Governments signed agreement establishing Mixed Commission to discuss dispute arising out of Venezuelan claim. Since Guyanaʼs independence May 1966, Mixed Commission has met 9 times and has generally served as useful channel for diversion political heat generated in both countries.</item>

                            <item>Mixed Commission meetings have been frustrating to GOV, however, since it apparently saw purpose Mixed Commission to redraw boundary, whereas Guyana saw it as forum to examine validity Venezuelan allegations concerning Arbitral Award. In effort break impasse GOV offered contribute to joint economic development of disputed territory. GOG expressed willingness discuss Venezuelan economic assistance but broke down when it became clear to GOG that GOV wanted exercise more authority over project than normal for economic assistance donors.</item>

                            <item>Last year Venezuela occupied tiny border island Ankoko, half which claimed by Guyana. As dispute boiled over “Ankoko Affair” early summer 1967 we encouraged President Leoni receive Guyana emissary. Talks resulted in easing of tensions and assuring GOG that Venezuela did not intend to use force in dispute and that matter would be played in low key during pre-electoral period in Guyana.</item>

                            <item>In May 1968 Venezuela reiterated a 1965 warning that any commercial concessions GOG might grant to foreign firms in disputed territory would not be recognized by GOV. (GOV has policy not to grant new concessions for mineral exploration in territory it controls.) This brought angry charges from Guyana Government that Venezuela violating Geneva Agreement by publicizing its claim outside Mixed Commission and commiting “economic aggression” against Guyana. In late June GOV withdrew from sub-commission for economic development following refusal GOG entertain joint development of disputed territory.</item>

                            <item>On July 9 Venezuelan President issued decree claiming 9 miles of territorial sea beyond 3 miles claimed by Guyana off coast of disputed territory. “Explanatory note” published with degree pointed out Venezuela claims 12 mile territorial sea off its own coast and wished put on record its claim to similar area off disputed territory. However since Guyana does not claim zone from 3 to 12 miles Venezuela feels free claim zone and, “explanatory note” implies, exercise immediate sovereignty over it by some unstated “physical act of possession” or “concrete act of dominion.” GOV member Mixed Commission told press foreign merchant ships would have right innocent passage through zone (which includes major shipping lanes) but no fishing rights. Naval vessels could pass with GOV permission. GOV FonMin told <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Ambassador privately he “assumed” GOV will institute naval patrols of zone.</item>

                        <p>After an exchange of greetings the Prime Minister described the Venezuelan decree claiming nine miles of territorial waters beyond the three-mile limit off the disputed territory of Essequibo. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> also mentioned the Venezuelan warning to firms seeking concessions in the disputed territory. He said the warning had already scared off one Canadian investor.

                        <p>The President inquired about the outlook for the elections in Guyana. The Prime Minister expressed optimism. While no date has been set for the election, he thought it would be in early December.</p>
                        <p>The President, mentioning his interest in regional integration, asked the Prime Minister how he saw the Caribbean Development Bank shaping up. The Prime Minister described past difficulties with Jamaica. He noted that recently there seemed to be a change in the Jamaican attitude which gives some reason to hope they would join the Bank and bring the Bahamas and British Honduras with them.</p>

Thus we have no assurance that he will accept our guidance in this regard. <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">Peter DʼAguiar</persName> also is an extremely difficult person to deal with and so far has rejected our attempts to persuade him to take a more moderate and flexible line toward <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> has been in close touch with <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName> regarding the lawsuit that each of their parties is instituting and at one point it appeared that the two parties would cooperate closely in the suits. <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> have now agreed to <pb n="964" xml:id="pg_964" facs="0999"/>consult and cooperate in their attacks on <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> and the government. <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> continues to maintain a strongly anti-Communist attitude and told <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName> that he dislikes his Communist sympathies and will work with him only to obstruct any government plans for electoral chicanery. However, <persName corresp="#p_DPS1">DʼAguiar</persName> despises <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> passionately and has a paranoid streak in him; this combination may well induce him to take attitudes and to pursue courses of action that a better balanced man would avoid.</p>

                        <p>Bill <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> is asking urgently for your approval of a $12.9 million loan to modernize the rice industry in Guyana (Tab B).<note n="2" xml:id="d440fn2">Reference is to a November 18 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> to the President, attached but not printed.</note> Charlie Zwick <pb n="965" xml:id="pg_965" facs="1000"/>recommends your approval (Tab A).<note n="3" xml:id="d440fn3">Memorandum from Zwick to the President, November 21, attached but not printed.</note> Treasury has no problem on balance of payments grounds.</p>
                        <p>The critical elections in Guyana will take place December 16. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> has done a very good job of preparing the political ground to fend off <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Cheddi Jagan</persName>ʼs challenge at the polls. Although the East Indian population outnumbers <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs predominently black following, some of <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs supporters have been won over by <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs good government record. The outlook is for a very narrow <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> victory, barring last-minute surprises.</p>
                        <p>This rice loan project plays a key part in <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName>ʼs electoral strategy. The governmentʼs efforts to modernize Guyanaʼs rice industry, well publicized for over a year, will help split <persName corresp="#p_JCB1">Jagan</persName>ʼs almost solid political support among the small rice farmers, all of whom are East Indian. The project has been delayed for technical reasons long past the intended starting date. Nonetheless, announcement of the loan within the next few days will still have important political benefits for <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> and help to guarantee his election.</p>
                        <p>This is a good project on its economic merits. The overriding argument, however, is that it provides important political support for <persName corresp="#p_BLFS1">Burnham</persName> at this crucial point. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CDR1">Carlson</persName> urges your approval in time for an announcement to be made in Georgetown early next week.</p>
                        <p>I recommended that you approve authorization of this loan.</p>
