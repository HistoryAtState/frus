                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government.
                    The series documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of
                    policies and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. A statutory charter for
                    the preparation of the series was established by Title IV of the Department of
                    State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351 <hi rend="italic">et
                        seq.</hi>), which was signed by President George Bush on October 28,
                    1991.</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provide supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>

                <p>The volume presented here, which was originally compiled and prepared as a book
                    manuscript in 1987, meets all the standards of selection and editing prevailing
                    in the Department of State at that time and complies fully with the spirit of
                    the standards of selection, editing, and range of sources established by the
                    statute of October 28, 1991. This volume records policies and events of more
                    than 30 years ago, but the statute allows the Department until 1996 to reach the
                    30-year line in the publication of the series.</p>

                        Series</hi></p>
                <p>This volume is part of a triennial subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in
                    the foreign policy of the final 3 years (1958–1960) of the administration of
                    President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>. This
                    subseries comprises 18 print volumes totaling more than 16,000 pages and 7
                    microfiche supplements presenting more than 14,000 pages of original
                    documents.</p>
                <p>The focus of this volume is on the main foreign economic issues confronting U.S.
                    policymakers and on the formulation of major policies dealing with monetary and
                    trade issues, mutual security (or military assistance), economic aid,
                    international investment, strategic resources, and economic defense. Related
                    documents on U.S. policies toward the European Economic Community and military
                    assistance to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are included in Volume VII,
                    Part 1. Some aspects of military assistance are documented in Volume III in the
                    compilation on U.S. national security policy, while the bilateral and regional
                    dimensions of economic and military assistance to developing nations are treated
                    in volumes on the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia. U.S. policies on
                    economic defense and strategic materials and commodities also receive some
                    coverage in Volume X, Eastern Europe Region; Soviet Union; Cyprus.</p>

                    Series</hi></p>
                <p>The original research, compilation, and editing of this volume were done in 1987
                    under the Department regulation derived from Secretary of State Kellogg’s
                    charter of 1925. This regulation prescribed that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series include “a comprehensive record of the major foreign
                    policy decisions within the range of the Department of State’s
                    responsibilities.” The regulation further stipulated that the additional
                    required records “needed to supplement the documentation in the Department” be
                    obtained from other government agencies.</p>
                <p>The Department of State’s historians have had, for the series in general and for
                    the particular volume published here, complete and unconditional access to all
                    records and papers of the Department of State: the central files of the
                    Department; the files of the Department’s <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0009"
                    />Executive Secretariat that comprehend all the official papers created by or
                    submitted to the Secretary of State; the special decentralized files (“lot
                    files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files
                    of overseas diplomatic and consular posts and U.S. special missions; and all the
                    official correspondence with foreign governments and with other Federal
                    agencies. Any failure to include a complete Department of State record in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series cannot be attributed to
                    constraints or limitations placed upon the Department historians in their access
                    to Department records, information security regulations and practices
                    notwithstanding.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians preparing the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series, including the volume published here, have enjoyed
                    full access to the papers of the Presidents and to ail other White House foreign
                    policy records. All of this documentation has been made available for use in the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the
                    exceptional cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration, its Office of Presidential Libraries, and the particular
                    Presidential library. The Department of State owes particular thanks for the
                    research of this volume to the staff of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library.</p>
                <p>In addition to Presidential correspondence and records of Presidential meetings
                    and conversations, the documentation in the White House files at the Eisenhower
                    Library were the most important sources for the preparation of the volume
                    published here. Department historians had full and complete access to all the
                    institutional documentation of the National Security Council (<gloss
                        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>) including the memoranda of discussion at
                        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings, formal <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                        >NSC</gloss> documents, and related papers, There was also full access to
                    the subject files of Presidential records (particularly the Whitman File), the
                    files of other White House officials, and more informal policy documentation in
                    other collections in the Eisenhower Library. It should be noted that the editors
                    supplemented the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> records from the Eisenhower
                    Library with documents in the Department of State files.</p>
                <p>The records preserved and maintained at the Presidential libraries include some
                    of the most significant foreign affairs documentation of other Federal agencies
                    such as the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, and the
                    Central Intelligence Agency. Department of State historians, with the
                    considerable cooperation of the various agencies, have obtained access to
                    records requested for possible inclusion in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes. Access to records of other agencies maintained at
                    the Presidential libraries has been supplemented by special research visits to
                    the historical files retained by these agencies or transferred to the National
                    Archives and Records Administration. Department historians have enjoyed steadily
                    broadened <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0010"/>access to the records of the
                    Department of Defense, particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
                    the Office of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                <p>Completion of the declassification of this volume and the final steps of its
                    preparation for publication coincided with the development since early 1991 by
                    the Central Intelligence Agency in cooperation with the Department of State of
                    expanded access by Department historians to high-level intelligence documents
                    from among those records still in the custody of that Agency. The Department of
                    State chose not to postpone the publication of this volume to ascertain how such
                    access might affect the scope of available documentation and the changes that
                    might be made in the contents of this particular volume. The Department is,
                    however, using this expanded access, as arranged by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                        >CIA</gloss>’s History Staff, for compilation of future volumes in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.</p>
                <p>The statute of October 28, 1991, requires that the published record in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation of all the major foreign policy decisions
                    and actions of the United States Government. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the United States Government
                    cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete
                    access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by
                    providing copies of selected records. Although prepared in compliance with an
                    earlier Department regulation, this volume was prepared in a manner fully
                    consonant with the standards and mandates for compilation contained in the 1991
                    statute.</p>
                <p>The List of Sources, pages XIII-XVII, identifies the particular files and
                    collections used in the preparation of this volume.</p>
                <p>The editors also consulted copies of the journals of Clarence Randall, who was
                    Chairman of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy during this triennium, at the
                    Eisenhower Library. They gratefully acknowledge the permission of Mr. <persName

                    B. Hunter, to publish in this volume references to and quotations from the

                <p>In selecting documents for the volume published here, the editors sought to
                    present as complete a record as possible of the President’s policy decisions and
                    instructions regarding the basic elements of foreign economic policy. The
                    editors selected for inclusion policy recommendations placed before the
                    President both in written documents, in meetings of the National Security
                    Council, in major recommendations of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, and
                    in other oral presentations and briefings from various officials and agencies.

                    policy decisions was also a focus of the editors’ selection of documents for
                    this volume.</p>
                <p>The editors concentrated on the formulation and execution of the major lines of
                    foreign economic policy and left to other volumes in this series the
                    documentation of regional and bilateral policies and agreements. The location of
                    some of these other foreign economic policy records in the 1958–1960 segment of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is described earlier in this
                    Preface. In this volume, the editors did not seek to include documentation other
                    than that available to the White House and the Department of State on the
                    efforts in other Federal agencies to recommend foreign economic policies or to
                    implement and support policies finally adopted; nor did they seek to document
                    foreign economic intelligence activities.</p>
                <p>In selecting documents for this volume, the editors have concentrated exclusively
                    on presenting previously classified or undisclosed records. In general public
                    statements and agreements have not been included, although previously released
                    information has been identified where it is particularly relevant in
                    understanding documents printed here for the first time.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi></p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Incoming telegrams from U.S. missions are placed according to time of receipt in
                    the Department of State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of
                    transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and
                    date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.
                    Washington has not been included in the dateline if a document originated there
                    or if a conversation took place there.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Obvious typographical errors are
                    corrected, but other mistakes and omissions in the source text are corrected by
                    bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman
                    type. Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. The amount of material omitted because it was unrelated,
                    however, is not accounted for. All ellipses and brackets that appear in the
                    source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0012"/>
                <p>The unnumbered first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. The source
                    footnote also provides the background of important documents and policies and
                    indicates if the President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every
                    effort has been made to determine if a document has been previously published,
                    and this information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts have been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Declassification Review</hi></p>
                <p>The declassification review process for this volume resulted in the withholding
                    from publication of 0.14 percent of the documents originally selected. None of
                    the documents was completely denied. Most of the withheld material was in the
                    compilation on economic defense. In the opinion of the editors, the deletions do
                    not substantively impair the comprehensiveness or accuracy of the record of
                    United States foreign economic policy.</p>
                <p>The Division of Historical Documents Review of the Office of Freedom of
                    Information, Privacy, and Classification Review, Bureau of Diplomatic Security,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12356 on National Security Information
                    and applicable laws.</p>

                    to cause damage to the national security, requires classification: <list>

                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security and law.
                    Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic
                    and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of
                    the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific
                    documents of those governments.</p>

                                >Nixon</persName> reads in part: “I discussed with the Vice
                            President the desirability of establishing a Cabinet level group to
                            study possible Soviet economic warfare. He fully agreed.” (Eisenhower
                            Library, <persName>Dulles</persName> Papers, Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>)</note> He cited the advantage
                        that a Communist dictatorship has over a “profit” economy through dumping
                        goods or providing them at a price below cost so as to eliminate competitors
                        and dominate various national markets. This menace might not materialize, he
                        thought, should domestic pressures on the Russian government require greater
                        use of resources at home.</p>
                    <p>The President noted how Russia could make its approaches to needy countries
                        under the guise of giving assistance, then exploit the country once it had
                        established economic control. The Vice President contrasted the smooth,
                        quick actions of Russia with our own slowness necessitated by coordination
                        between the Executive and Legislative <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0034"
                        />branches and among agencies within the Executive branch. Sec. Weeks took
                        some comfort from the failure of Communist economies thus far to evidence an
                        ability to develop high standards of living. Sec. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> saw need for initiating the study
                        quickly since Russia had the power to offer attractive shopping lists and
                        thus lead other nations to break contracts they might have with us, as
                        particularly some Arab states.</p>
                    <p>The President and Amb. <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> commented
                        on the need for associating more citizens of other lands in our business
                        establishments abroad as a means of increasing their interest.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted ironically how the
                        Russians deliberately refrain from telling their own people about the
                        attractive economic offers they make to other governments, such as
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The President noted the willingness of the country to ignore the cost of
                        weapons in time of a shooting war and even to curtail certain freedoms. He
                        felt that an economic war should also be considered gravely and that
                        adequate provision for winning it must be made.</p>
                    <p>The President directed that a preliminary plan quickly be drawn up for
                        accomplishing the major study that would be necessary, and the Vice
                        President said he would follow through with interested members of the
                            Cabinet.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">The record of action on this item is

                    <p>On January 22, Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Clarence Randall</persName>, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">C. Douglas Dillon</persName> met in the Vice
                        President’s office to discuss possible responses to the Soviet economic
                        threat. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> described the session
                        in his journal as “a full hour and a half of intense, though unhurried
                        discussion of how to mobilize forces in the United States to meet the double
                        Soviet threat in the economic field, namely, the drawing into the Soviet
                        orbit of the resources and markets of the new countries, and the deliberate
                        disrupting of the American economy by Soviet moves in our existing
                        markets.”</p>
                    <p>According to <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>, he asked the
                        Vice President how the subject came to be presented to the Cabinet on
                        January 10 when it was not on the agenda. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> replied that he himself was surprised when
                            <persName>Dulles</persName> raised it, although he and the Secretary had
                        discussed the subject earlier.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>’s journal records the
                        discussion in part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“As a measure of the importance of the subject, the Vice President
                                said with great earnestness, ‘I think that what we three men are
                                talking about in this room is of far more importance to the future
                                of our country than all of the current hysteria about missiles. I
                                think this is the real target of the Soviets.’</p>
                            <p>“It was heartening to me to hear this from him, because I have been
                                saying it in my speeches and to my friends.</p>
                            <p>“To meet this he said that in his judgment, all of the resources
                                available to our government must be placed in the hands of one man
                                who might throw promptly against a single target everything that
                                would be required to meet a Russian threat. In our economic
                                armament, he spoke of the Development Fund, PL–480, the Ex-Im Bank,
                                and even the World Bank. He likened it to economic warfare during
                                the war.</p>
                            <p>“I replied that our economic warfare program had been based upon
                                rigid controls of the domestic economy, and that I did not see how
                                this could be duplicated. He reflected on that and agreed that it
                                was politically impossible.</p>
                            <p>“I knew that his mind was coming back to the economic czar complex,
                                and that his piercing eyes were on me, so I said, ‘Furthermore, Mr.
                                Vice President, while we have our present constitutional system you
                                cannot give any man in the White House, short of the President,
                                authority over Cabinet officers. We on the White House staff may try
                                to coordinate, as I do, but we may never order.’</p>
                            <p>“He always seemed to agree with me on this, but he nevertheless kept
                                coming back to the one man idea, and I am afraid it will burst out
                                again.</p>
                            <p>“At this point, Douglas Dillon mentioned Nelson Rockefeller, and the
                                Vice President’s mind clicked instantly. He said, ‘Wouldn’t that
                                have been a fine idea for me to arrive at conclusions here and
                                ignore <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0037"/>Nelson’s Committee on
                                Government Organization?’ Promptly he put through a telephone call
                                to New York and arranged to discuss this subject with Nelson there
                                next week.</p>
                            <p>“He then himself raised the question of whether the Operations
                                Coordinating Board should handle this matter, and himself dismissed
                                it on the ground that they are staffed at too low a level, and that
                                their job should be to police the carrying out of policy rather than
                                the establishment of policy.</p>
                            <p>“Through all this, Douglas really had no specific plan or program to
                                offer. Neither did the Vice President. They were both groping.</p>
                            <p>“My mind had been racing along all during the conference, because I
                                felt an obligation to put a specific idea before them, so I finally
                                said:</p>
                            <p>“‘I think, Sir, that you want a definite idea about which to focus
                                your thinking, and I will take the responsibility of putting one
                                before you. Here is what I would do. I would give Douglas Dillon a
                                staff of five men, who must have creative minds and vigorous
                                personalities.</p>
                            <p>“‘They would be fed current intelligence thoroughly. The moment the
                                Soviets made a new move in any country, they would try to design a
                                counter to it. That program would be communicated immediately to me.
                                That would present no difficulty, because Douglas and I work so
                                closely together. Out of my general background and experience in
                                this subject I would hope to have an instinct as to whether a
                                specific program had difficulties in terms of interagency
                                relationships. If I saw none, I would clear it. If I sensed
                                controversy, I would on very short notice put it to the Council for
                                determination. Once the program was approved, Operations
                                Coordinating Board would see that it was carried out.’</p>
                            <p>“The Vice President’s face broke into a smile and he said, ‘That’s
                                good, I like it. It’s a marriage, and gives to <gloss

                        economic warfare on the U.S. This announcement would seem to call for a
                        policy which more distinctly spells out what our reaction should be.
                        Existing statements of policy do not appear to concern themselves directly
                        with this new phase of the Soviet offensive.</p>

                        activity at any particular time.”</p>
                    <p>I submit that this negative approach is no longer in consonance with the
                        events of today.</p>
                    <p>In my judgement, therefore, we require first, a positive policy in the
                        economic field and second, integrated action in the Executive Branch. This
                        latter action would require far reaching steps to ensure that Export-Import
                        loans, <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>, PL 480, Trade Agreements, Fairs,

                        etc., are all focussed on the central policy purpose.</p>
                    <p>I think that we should also search for more adequate means to counter Soviet
                        moves in the manipulation of commodity markets and in the subsidization of
                        industrial exports. We should also find means of stopping the trends toward
                        nationalization as distinguished from our present system of offering
                        guaranties to protect companies from effects of actual nationalization.
                        Finally, we should find out how we can assure foreign producers of raw
                        materials the long-term and constant markets which they need, and provide
                        ourselves with assured long-term supply.</p>
                    <p>We are not in a position, legally or financially, to undertake a positive
                        program in these areas. The Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, on
                        the other hand, is not inhibited by legal and financial considerations.
                        Moreover, it is established as a highly centralized department embracing all
                        of the tools which we have, divided between Government and private industry.
                        It is thus much better equipped than we are to wage economic warfare. We
                        should not lose sight of these considerations.</p>

                    <p>[Here follows discussion of possible foreign trips by the Vice
                        President.]</p>
                    <p>(2) We discussed at some length the project for a study of economic warfare.
                        We agreed that there were two aspects; one, the possibility that within the
                        next two to five years the Soviet Union might develop a capability and
                        purpose to wage economic warfare against our free enterprise system by
                        getting control of raw materials and by disrupting free world markets
                        through dumping of raw materials and/or manufactured goods. There might be a
                        real question as to whether our classical free trade methods based upon
                        profits by private enterprise could survive that kind of a struggle.</p>
                    <p>Then there was the second phase already with us of handling effectively our
                        own economic aid programs and meeting Soviet bloc competition in the less
                        developed countries.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the first matter, I suggested that an unpublicized study by
                        some experienced person such as Sydney Weinberg,<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2"
                            >Investment banker Sidney J. Weinberg.</note> drawing upon government
                        and private persons for advice, would be the best way to handle this matter.
                        The Vice President said he was inclined to agree to this approach.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the more efficient handling of our own foreign aid, including
                        the Export-Import Bank and the new Development Loan Fund, the Vice President
                        felt the strong need of a more authoritative and unified direction. He
                        wondered whether the status of <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        might be increased by making him an Under Secretary of State rather than <pb
                            n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0041"/>Deputy Under Secretary and then giving
                        him a certain directive authority covering the entire field.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d5fn3"><persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> became
                            Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs on July 1,
                        1958.</note></p>
                    <p>I said I doubted that a mere change in title would accomplish the result. He
                        could be given added authority by the President and myself, but the problem
                        would be how, for example, to bring the Exim Bank and Development Loan Fund
                        into a single, cohesive, policy performing agency, since there were built-in
                        statutory provisions and Congressional backing of different kinds. It would,
                        I thought, be necessary to have some clear understanding with the manager
                        and directors of the Exim Bank. I did not think that this could be achieved
                        merely by a slight change in <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s
                        title. The problem was much more fundamental than that. The Vice President
                        indicated that he was disposed to agree and that the problem of how to
                        proceed required perhaps some further thought. He felt, however, very
                        strongly, as did I, that greater unity and efficiency were required in this
                        field of foreign aid, particularly to less developed countries.</p>

                        AREAS</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1. Principal Developments.</hi></p>
                    <p>With new boldness, the Sino-Soviet Bloc attempted, during the quarter ending
                        31 December 1957, to exploit its prestige in the underdeveloped countries, a
                        prestige heightened by recent Soviet scientific achievements. These attempts
                        were climaxed in late December at the unofficial Asian-African Solidarity
                        Conference held in Cairo, where the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        made a dramatic offer of economic assistance to underdeveloped <pb n="10"
                            xml:id="pg_10" facs="0042"/>countries. This offer was as much a
                        challenge to the economic superiority of the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> as it was a proposal that economic development in Asia and
                        Africa should be supported by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The
                        principal Soviet speaker at the conference also recommended that other
                        underdeveloped countries follow the lead of Indonesia and Egypt in
                        nationalizing foreign-owned industry in order to obtain funds needed for
                        economic development. The conference established permanent headquarters in
                        Cairo. With Russians and Chinese Communists represented in its secretariat,
                        this organization may well become a center for further Communist permeation
                        of Asia and Africa.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Bloc has not slackened its efforts to move forward with its
                        economic aid program. In addition to expanding its efforts in countries that
                        have already accepted considerable Bloc aid, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> made attractive new offers to countries that have
                        heretofore been reluctant to take assistance from Communist nations. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> presented a proposal for a general
                        development program to Iran as well as a plan for a joint company for the
                        exploitation of petroleum resources in Northern Iran. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> suggested to the Ceylonese
                        Ambassador in Moscow that Soviet technicians could be used to expand rubber
                        output in Ceylon and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
                        take all of the increase in production. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> offered economic assistance to Sudan and indicated a
                        willingness to make large purchases of Sudanese cotton at a time when
                        Sudan’s sales to Western buyers were lagging. Even in Latin America, where
                        the Bloc previously has had little success, attractive offers were made to
                        Brazil and Uruguay.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Egypt</hi></p>
                    <p>During a November visit to Moscow the Egyptian Minister of Defense
                        tentatively arranged an economic aid agreement in which the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is to provide a credit of about $175
                        million to be used in Egypt’s 5-year industrial development program. In
                        addition, new arrangements have been made under which the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will continue sending military items to
                        Egypt. Also in November, it was announced that a Czechoslovak loan of $56
                        million had been extended to Egypt in September. This loan will be used to
                        finance projects that are included in the industrial development program of
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. Syria.</hi></p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> agreed in October to furnish on
                        credit to Syria additional military supplies and equipment worth $30
                        million. It is believed that by late December virtually all of the new
                        military items had been delivered. Progress has been made in implementing
                        the earlier Soviet-Syrian economic aid agreement, and plans for specific
                        projects are under way.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0043"/>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">4. Indonesia.</hi></p>
                    <p>Indonesia’s attempt to unify its many dissident elements by seizing
                        Dutch-owned property has intensified already serious economic, political,
                        and military problems. The Indonesian government claims that its armed
                        forces must have large quantities of military items and has approved a
                        decision to seek arms worth about $250 million wherever they can be
                        obtained. A purchasing team left Indonesia on 31 December 1957 to visit
                        several prospective supplying countries, including Egypt, Yugoslavia,
                        Poland, and Czechoslovakia as well as some countries in Western Europe.
                        Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko is reported to have told the Indonesian
                        Ambassador that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would extend all
                        types of assistance if a break with the Netherlands should result in
                        financial and economic difficulties.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">5. US and Bloc Foreign Aid.</hi></p>
                    <p>In over-all terms the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid program to
                        underdeveloped countries of the Free World is substantially larger than that
                        of the Sino-Soviet Bloc. Since the first Bloc aid was extended about 21/2
                        years ago, the countries in the Sino-Soviet Bloc have extended credits and
                        grants for military and economic uses amounting to nearly $1.9 billion. In
                        comparison, aid by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government
                        (including PL 480, <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>, and Ex-Im Bank)
                        committed to the underdeveloped countries of the Free World during this
                        period amounted to about $8 billion. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        program also was broader in scope, with 50 underdeveloped countries
                        receiving assistance compared with 17 underdeveloped countries receiving
                        Bloc aid.</p>
                    <p>Appraisal in total terms alone, however, provides an inadequate basis for
                        comparison of the two programs. In nearly all countries where the
                        Sino-Soviet Bloc is competing with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid
                        programs, the Bloc is currently committed to larger amounts of aid than is
                        the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. With the exception of Syria, all of
                        the nine underdeveloped countries<note n="1" xml:id="d6fn1">Afghanistan,
                            Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Syria, and Yugoslavia.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> which are the principal recipients
                        of Bloc aid also have been receiving funds from the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>. These 9 countries have received credits or grants from the
                        Sino-Soviet Bloc amounting to about $1.8 billion during the last 21/2 years.
                        Over the same period, about $1 billion in assistance of all types was
                        received from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on a governmental basis.
                        Although exact comparisons are not available, it is estimated that Bloc
                        technical personnel in these 9 countries number more than 2,000 compared
                        with less than 1,000 under programs financed by the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> Government.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0044"/>
                    <p>One characteristic of the Bloc aid program worthy of note is its independence
                        from military pacts. The contrast with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        is quite apparent: the bulk of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid to
                        underdeveloped countries goes to those with which the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> is allied in military pacts, but no underdeveloped country
                        receiving Bloc assistance is a member of a Bloc military alliance.</p>

                        clear (pars. 18, 50, 53 and 73) that, under conditions of mutual deterrence,
                        the Soviet bloc will wage increasingly vigorous and effective economic and
                        political offensives.</p>
                    <p>I also continue to subscribe to Mr. <persName>Dearborn</persName>’s view that
                        we should not establish entirely new governmental machinery to deal with
                        this problem, and that it can best be handled through the Operations
                        Coordinating Board. I believe a special committee of the <gloss
                            target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> should be established, probably under the
                        chairmanship of a high-level person from Douglas Dillon’s office, with
                        functions along the lines of those proposed in par. 4 of Mr.
                            <persName>Dearborn</persName>’s memorandum of January 9. Administrative
                        and legal restrictions on our aid and other economic programs constitute one
                        general problem area with which such a committee might concern itself.
                        Because Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> has responsibility
                        for a number of the relevant operational programs, such a committee could

                                Corporation, was a member of the Business Advisory Council of the

                    <p>The Vice President said that in thinking about the problem of the study of
                        counter-measures to Soviet economic warfare it had been clear that
                        high-level government officials were all so deeply engaged on current
                        problems that they would not have the time to make a thorough study which
                        the question demanded. An outside study with a minimum of publicity seemed
                        the best answer. The Vice President said he had mentioned the matter to
                        Sidney Weinberg and also to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName>, and both had felt that the mechanism of the Business
                        Advisory Council provided the ideal solution. It was felt that a special
                        committee of about five or six individuals could be set up to study the
                        problem. These individuals would have to devote considerable time to the
                        matter and the study could be expected to last for as long as a year.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then outlined the
                        great importance which he attached to this matter, saying that it might well
                        be the most serious problem to be faced by the free countries in the coming
                        years. Therefore, he said that the study must be taken very seriously by all
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President agreed and said he felt the study should be initiated by
                        the President asking the individuals who would make the study to come to
                        Washington, and charging them personally with the mission. He then said the
                        most important matter was the choice of a man to head up the study.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boeschenstein</persName> said he was thinking
                        of the highest caliber executives in the Business Advisory Council who had
                        extensive experience in world business. He said he thought Mr.
                            <persName>C.S. Allyn</persName>, of the National Cash Register Company,
                        would make an excellent chairman of the study group. It was agreed that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boeschenstein</persName> and Secretary <pb
                            n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0047"/><persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> would get up a list of about ten possible members of
                        such a study group and submit it to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> for joint decision as to the five or six most
                        suitable individuals.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President then said it was most important that the group be provided
                        with an adequate staff. It was agreed that the head of the staff should
                        probably be provided through Business Advisory Council sources. It was
                        emphasized that a competent State Department officer would have to be
                        assigned full time to this work in order to ensure that State Department
                        information was available to the study group, and to keep the Department
                        informed of progress. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> agreed on the importance of such a relationship with
                        the State Department, and asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> to make sure that a competent officer would be
                        assigned to the group once it was established, this officer to keep Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> currently informed of the
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked the Vice
                        President whether or not there should be a report of this action to the
                        Cabinet. The Vice President felt it was preferable to make no such report in
                        order to keep the fact that the study was being made as quiet as
                        possible.</p>

                            an over-all Soviet campaign which looks to the ultimate subversion and,

                            find few opportunities to exploit. Our basic reaction to this campaign,
                            therefore, should be to look to our own programs, to see if there are
                            any ways in which they could be rendered even more effective in

                                    of great importance, since soft loans are a vital element of our

                                    other free industrial countries to increase their economic and
                                    technical aid to less developed countries; some of these
                                    countries-notably Germany-have the capacity to do more than they
                                    are now doing.</item>

                                        how it is administered. When the Soviets err, we can try to
                                        make sure that they reap the full whirlwind by bringing

                    <p>The dinner had been preceded by an afternoon-long briefing by the Department
                        of State of those members of the Business Advisory Council who had been
                        chosen as a committee to address themselves to this problem.<note n="2"

                    <p>After the President’s introductory remarks setting forth the problem with
                        which he was concerned, the Secretary of State related this specific problem
                        to the over-all struggle between the Sino-Soviet bloc and the U.S. and
                        indicated he felt this economic offensive was its most important aspect at
                        this time.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Weeks then spoke to the assets this nation had in its business
                        activity overseas and the need for the closest possible cooperation between
                        business and the government to counter current Sino-Soviet moves.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President made the point that in Latin America, as well as in other
                        underdeveloped areas, one of the fertile grounds for Communist exploitation
                        was the strong desire on the part of the mass of the peoples of these
                        countries to change their economic status for the better. He said that an
                        effective Communist lure was the argument that “capitalist” trade between
                        the U.S. and those countries did nothing more than make the rich richer,
                        without improving the lot of the poor. To the extent to which this was true
                        or made to appear true, it fostered sympathy toward Communist promises of a
                        change.</p>

                    <p>The Vice President also urged the Business Advisory Council to draw as
                        appropriate upon their overseas representatives for help in this study, as
                        he believed some of them to be among the most knowledgeable and experienced
                        persons available to address themselves to this problem.</p>

                        of economic devices that have been developed by the Soviet Union to make its
                        economic offensive effective.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of the Treasury observed that to compete effectively against
                        the political appeals engendered by the Communist trade and aid offers, the
                        lending institutions in this country, both private and governmental or
                        intergovernmental, would have to take greater risks and modify their pure
                        banker’s perspective toward the soundness of loans in order to make funds
                        available to impact activities, some of which are now being excluded because

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bechtel</persName> expressed, on behalf of the group, the
                        gratification of American businessmen at being asked by the President to
                        address themselves to this important problem.</p>
                    <p>On various occasions during the discussion the President reiterated his
                        conviction that the challenge presented by the Sino-Soviet economic
                        offensive, serious as it was, was perfectly capable of being successfully
                        countered if the combined strengths of free government and free private
                        enterprise were fully applied to the achievement of this objective.</p>

                    <p>The Prime Minister said he had been struck by the Secretary’s recent speech
                        to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on the overall situation
                        vis-à-vis the Soviet Union.<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2">On June 6; for text,
                            see American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1958, pp. 34–46.</note>
                        This was a very large problem and hard to condense. He would attempt to
                        summarize it in this way:</p>
                    <p>Looking at the military equation, it seemed clear that, so long as the West
                        did not do foolish things, the balance of military power was such as to
                        prevent any formal, global war because of the enormous destruction that
                        would result. Therefore the struggle between the two contending points of
                        view represented by the Communists and ourselves would probably move from
                        one field to another, and specifically it would move into the fields of
                        economics and of propaganda.</p>
                    <p>Looking at the economic field, there were two main aspects. One was what the
                        Soviets might be able to do to us. The other was what we might do to
                        ourselves. Our traditional economic rules of supply and demand, etc., don’t
                        apply to the Soviet system. Our system is therefore brought up against a
                        wholly new and different proposition, which is puzzling for us. Earlier, the
                        economic strength of the Soviet <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0057"/>Union
                        was used to build up the country internally, but now it has grown so that it
                        is able to produce and dispose of surpluses on the world market, not for
                        normal economic reasons but to undercut the free world trading system.
                        Therefore our former attitudes with respect to tariffs and quotas and the
                        like are tending to become obsolete, and require change. All of this is only
                        just beginning, and we do not yet know what the answer will be.</p>
                    <p>Turning to what we might do to ourselves, the Prime Minister observed that if
                        we are to allow our economies to fall into a decline then we will bring
                        about precisely what the Marxists want, and have steadily predicted. Since
                        the war we have had a fairly continuous boom. People had come to think that
                        the process of expansion was automatic. Now it is something of a shock to
                        them to find out otherwise. Unless we can get our economies moving forward,
                        we will not be able to do what needs to be done, for example, for the less
                        developed areas. During and immediately following the war prices were good
                        for primary commodities produced by the less developed countries. It was
                        widely felt that the only problem was to achieve more and more development.
                        Now it is clear that world trade is very important to these countries, and
                        if such trade is to be sustained, the industrialized countries must keep
                        their economies on an even keel. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had
                        done its best to keep inflation down and to keep labor costs under control,
                        but at some point it must contemplate an expanded economy. For the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> the most serious problem is how to achieve
                        expansion without inflation, for inflation would lead to a drain on the
                        reserves. The Western world as a whole must prove Marx wrong by avoiding
                        booms and slumps and by assuring a steady expansion of world trade.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the liquidity problem, the Prime Minister said that it was like
                        the chicken-and-egg argument. Some people felt that if there could be a
                        large increase in liquidity, larger trade would follow. Others felt that if
                        larger trade were achieved that would create a liquidity problem, which
                        would then have to be solved.</p>
                    <p>Summarizing, the Prime Minister said that we must (1) examine what the
                        Soviets may be able to do to us by reason of their greater economic
                        capability and unorthodox methods and (2) consider what we might do to
                        ourselves through failure to maintain stability, increase development and
                        expand trade.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the problem had
                        to be broken down because of its many facets. We would have to look at both
                        the national agencies and the international agencies. On the international
                        side, we have the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Both have
                        demonstrated their utility. Some question has been raised about whether
                        these institutions have adequate resources. Domestically, in the U.S., we
                        have the Development Loan Fund and the Export-Import Bank. For these
                        institutions Congress has just increased by $2 billion <pb n="26"
                            xml:id="pg_26" facs="0058"/>the lending power of the Export-Import Bank
                        and is considering legislation to increase by some $600 million the
                        resources of the Development Loan Fund. In the trade field the US has
                        encouraged enlarged trade and has favored a liberal commercial policy.
                        Congress is now considering an extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements
                        Act. Although this legislation might perhaps be considered as more of a
                        symbol than as a means of achieving really substantial tariff reductions, it
                        would be valuable in dealing with the European Common Market.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Soviet Union, there was no doubt that the enhanced power
                        of the Soviet Union to produce and dispose of surpluses on the world market
                        by methods departing from normal commercial standards could do much
                        mischief. This is of concern to us more over the longer term than
                        immediately. Because of our concern, we have arranged for a top-level group
                        of outstanding businessmen to study the whole matter in consultation with
                        the various government agencies. We hope that this group may be able to
                        report within a few months.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that it must
                        continue to be a basic objective of the countries of the free world to
                        enlarge international trade. In pursuing this objective, free economic
                        systems such as our own are under certain disadvantages in competing with a
                        managed economy such as the Soviet Union. The less developed countries,
                        which had suffered greatest economically over the years, were now demanding
                        a change of status, and demanding it more insistently than ever before. They
                        were not so much concerned over the political ideologies involved but over
                        the practical results of bringing material improvement. That is why the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is such a formidable competitor
                        against us in these countries. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is
                        committed to a policy of larger trade, but it can implement this policy only
                        as rapidly as its own domestic political and economic situations will
                        permit. The same situation faces the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                        other democratic regimes. The Soviets, on the other hand, can carry out
                        trade transactions without regard to the desires of their domestic
                        producers. They can import wheat under a barter deal and then tell their
                        farmers to produce something else. Soviet loans can only be spent within the
                        Soviet bloc, whereas the goods which flow under US loans in dollars or under
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> loans in pounds sterling are competed
                        for all around the world. Nevertheless, we believe that most of the free
                        world governments would prefer to avoid dealing with the Soviet Bloc if they
                        could. He felt that the Soviet economic offensive presents American private
                        capital with a new kind of challenge. He hoped that some answers could be
                        found through the business study group mentioned by Secretary Dulles. He
                        felt that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government had to find some
                        new method of associating its efforts with private enterprise.</p>
                    <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0059"/>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">World Bank and International Monetary
                            Fund</hi></p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then turned to the
                        question of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The Bank, he
                        said, was now lending at a higher rate than had been thought possible
                        several years ago. Loans in 1957 were running at an annual rate of $800
                        million. The resources for these loans were drawn not only from the members’
                        subscriptions of 2% in gold and 18% in cash, but also from bonds issued by
                        the Bank on the private capital market. These bonds were guaranteed by the
                        remaining 80% capital subscription of the member governments for which they
                        assumed a contingent liability. The US believes that the Bank can continue
                        to lend at the present high rate for the next year or so. But when the
                        volume of bonds offered by the Bank approaches the contingent liability of
                        governments with hard currencies, bondholders will want to know whether
                        these governments will assume additional contingent liability. There is,
                        therefore, the possibility that the Bank’s borrowing and lending operations
                        might be expanded by increasing the contingent liability part of their
                        capital subscriptions to the Bank (but not their contributions in gold or
                        cash), thus avoiding any immediate burden on the budgets of governments.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the International Monetary Fund, the situation was different.
                        The resources of the Fund could not be increased without some additional
                        cash payments by member governments, which would result in a budget burden.
                        The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had not as yet determined its position
                        on this matter. We have the problem in mind and are giving careful study to
                        it in the light of trade developments. We have no concrete views on the
                        desirable size of additional contributions to the Fund. The immediate
                        question was what should be said about this matter at the New Delhi meeting
                        of the Bank and Fund in September. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        considers that it would not be wise to present any concrete proposal at the
                        New Delhi meeting for the reason that governments would not have been fully
                        prepared to consider and debate the question intelligently at that time.
                        However, we believe that, if Messrs. Black and Jacobsson raise the question,
                        it might be possible to agree at the New Delhi meeting to establish a
                        competent committee, appointed by the governors, to consider the whole
                        problem of what might be done about the Fund and the Bank. In this way we
                        can proceed with an examination of the question in an orderly manner and
                        avoid damaging debates in an open forum.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> added that he
                        thought it unfortunate that there had been growing discussion of the
                        shortage of world financial liquidity in the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> press. He feared that
                        press discussion of this subject prior to the reaching of agreement between
                        governments could set off speculative currency movements with damaging
                        repercussions. He said that, for example, the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> had received many inquiries <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28"
                            facs="0060"/>regarding the price of gold, and we had had to make it
                        absolutely clear that the question of the price of gold was not even under
                        consideration by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government. He
                        understood that we could not, of course, control the press, but we should do
                        what we could to avoid creating a climate of risk. We would hope to minimize
                        this kind of discussion at New Delhi. The creation by the governors of the
                        Bank and Fund of a competent committee to examine the problem might be one
                        way to avoid this.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> added that he
                        wished to compliment the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> government on the
                        handling of its economic problems. He admired greatly the resolute and
                        courageous action of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in taking the
                        measures which it had taken to check inflation and promote stability.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">US Economic Situation</hi></p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then turned to the
                        current <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic scene. He felt that
                        recent developments in this country must be kept in perspective. The years
                        1956 and 1957 were the best economic years we had ever achieved, with a
                        gross national product of $435 billion. He pointed out that even in 1957
                        there had been wide fluctuations from month to month-in some months the
                        changes had been as great as $9 billion-in the annual rate of output.
                        Unemployment in the first six months of 1957 was 3 million. This year, 1958,
                        the peak was slightly above 5 million. We were therefore talking about a
                        change in unemployment of only 2 million. Unemployment was heavily
                        concentrated in the durable goods field. Of the 2 million additional
                        unemployed, 11/2 million were in the heavy industries-steel, autos, machine
                        tools and the like-and only 0.5 million in other industries. For the durable
                        industries as a whole the decline from the peak reached in the first half of
                        1957 had been about 16%, whereas the decline in non-durables had been only
                        6%. Personal income had reached an all time high in August 1957, and had
                        never been more than 11% below this high since that time. Personal income
                        was now going up. Farm income during the first quarter of 1958 was 11% over
                        the comparable quarter of 1957 and was at its highest level since 1954.
                        Retail sales were as high or higher than in 1957.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> went on to say that
                        several reasons had been advanced for the decline in the durable goods
                        industries, which accounted for the greater part of the current recession.
                        One factor was consumer choice-a switch from durables to non-durables.
                        Another was the fact that in 1954–56 there had been a large increase in
                        personal indebtedness arising out of heavy purchases of durable goods. This
                        debt was now being worked down. The result was that savings had increased,
                        available credit had expanded, and interest rates had dropped.</p>
                    <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0061"/>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Economic Assistance to Less-Developed
                            Areas-Commodity Problems</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> observed that while we had
                        put a substantial amount of aid into the less-developed countries, the price
                        declines for the major exports of these countries have meant for them a much
                        greater financial loss than the financial gains they have received from our
                        aid. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has therefore felt that it must
                        address itself to commodity problems more vigorously than it had before. We
                        still feel that we cannot support world prices through governmental support
                        measures but we may be able to do more in searching for a solution to these
                        problems than we have in the past, when we frequently took the position that
                        we were not even willing to discuss such problems. For this reason we have
                        agreed to participate with the Latin American countries in a study group on
                        coffee, the first meeting of which will be held tomorrow here in Washington.
                        African countries have been asked to send observers to the meeting, and may
                        decide to participate. The Australian government had suggested a somewhat
                        similar approach to the problems of lead and zinc. We have not yet reached a
                        conclusion on this but are studying the proposal sympathetically. We would
                        like to work more closely with the UK in this whole field.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that in the field of
                        development we would also like to work more closely with the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Some of our ICA people believe it would be
                        useful to meet with British officials in London in order to exchange
                        experiences from which both might gain. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> then referred to the various suggestions which have
                        been made to step up aid to the less-developed areas through multilateral
                        action. These suggestions had come, for example, out of the Council of
                        Europe, from the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>, and from individual
                        governments as in the case of the Pella Plan. He referred in this connection
                        to the consideration now being given in the Senate to the establishment of
                        an International Development Association under the World Bank. It was
                        anticipated that the Senate would adopt a resolution urging study of this
                        proposal, which would enable the Bank to make soft loans to less developed
                        countries. At some stage we would like to obtain the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>’s ideas on this. We have not made up our own minds as yet
                        but want to explore it. If such a new multilateral agency were to be
                        established, it would have to be one to which all countries would contribute
                        real resources and could not be merely a facade for <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> assistance.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented on the work of
                        the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        study group, to examine the Soviet economic offensive and the problem of
                        counter-measures, which had been set up following the Prime Minister’s last
                        visit. He felt that one of the results of these discussions had been to <pb
                            n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0062"/>reveal to both governments that
                        neither of them was very well organized to cope with this problem and that
                        early attention would have to be given to internal organization within the
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>’s
                        statements on the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economy the Prime
                        Minister observed that perhaps there had been a tendency for those not
                        having responsibility to exaggerate the gloomy side of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> recession, while those in charge felt
                        otherwise. It was very hard to achieve a right balance. This illustrated how
                        important it was for the two governments to keep in close consultation on
                        economic problems. He thought that it was very important to continue the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        group on counter-measures and that it might be well to set up an expanded or
                        separate group to keep in touch with broader economic developments. The
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was very anxious that something be
                        accomplished at the forthcoming Commonwealth meeting, but was also anxious
                        that whatever was done at the Commonwealth level should be kept in step with
                        the wider interests of the free world. The idea would be to steer the
                        results of the Commonwealth meeting into the general theme of free-world
                        cooperation. He would like to have <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> consultations of a broader and more permanent
                        kind in this field.</p>
                    <p>(The Prime Minister then referred parenthetically to the German economic
                        situation. He had had some good talks with Chancellor <persName
                            corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. He recognized that the Germans
                        have a very serious problem because of the preoccupation of their people
                        with the spectre of inflation arising from past experience with two total
                        inflations. The Germans were perhaps more afraid about inflation than
                        unemployment and therefore they have a tendency toward deflation which helps
                        to create balance of payments problems for other countries. The Prime
                        Minister felt that it was no good trying to push the Germans into extending
                        economic assistance directly. The only way to draw them in would be by
                        getting them to contribute to international organizations, whether this
                        might be through the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>, the EPU, the
                        Common Market or other means. It is probable that they will agree to make
                        contributions to organizations, whereas they would be very reluctant to
                        adopt special legislation or facilities for direct bilateral assistance on a
                        government-to-government basis.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> agreed with the
                        Prime Minister’s analysis of the German “psychosis” about inflation. He
                        remarked that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> perhaps had a psychosis
                        about unemployment.)</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> stated that the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would like to be as cooperative as
                        possible with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, but that whatever
                        consultative methods were adopted should be very informal and not
                        organized.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister suggested that the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> counter-measures group
                        might well be broadened or raised to a higher level for the purpose of
                        discussing these wider economic issues which went beyond the immediate
                        problems of the Soviet economic offensive.</p>

                        500%-a big percentage partially because of the low starting point-since
                        1954. Since February 1956, he said, an interdepartmental working group had
                        been watching developments and reporting every two weeks. He offered to
                        provide these reports to any interested Cabinet member not already receiving
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> briefly sketched Soviet trade and grant
                        programs in recent years, particularly with six countries-Egypt, Syria,
                        Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, India, and Indonesia. China and other satellite
                        countries joined the Soviet in these programs. He noted that the Communists
                        are particularly effective in dealing with one crop countries and are
                        willing to do so at great cost to themselves if the political benefits seem
                        large enough. Thus, the Communists could take actions that the private
                        businesses of a profit economy are not geared to take.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> asserted that the Free World faces a quite
                        dangerous situation in the Soviet capacity to dislocate established markets;
                        for instance, they could deliver oil to Western Europe, undercutting other
                        sources. Also they are tending to bite heavily into the markets for certain
                        products in developed countries-as, for instance, aluminum.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that the Russians do not have a
                        most effective trade mechanism on which to base these efforts since they do
                        not have an established international currency, the ruble being practically
                        worthless except behind the Iron Curtain.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> emphasized that
                        practically all foreign policy matters are related to the solution of this
                        problem and that the solution could not be expected from any single
                        “dramatic” move. He stated that the mutual security program continued to be
                        a most important weapon in this.</p>
                    <p>Organizationally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> said,
                        steps had been taken to establish in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName>’s office the focal point for new ideas in this

                                >Randall</persName> had urged in a May 13 memorandum to Assistant to
                            the President Sherman Adams that responsibility for the development of
                            action programs in this area should rest with Dillon. (Eisenhower

                            1959, the position of Special Assistant for Communist Economic Affairs
                            was created in the Office of the Under Secretary of State for Economic
                            Affairs, later in the Office of the Under Secretary of State.</note>
                        Also, Sec. Weeks had asked the Business Advisory Council to look into the
                        problem and had proceeded to set up a strong Committee which will be ready
                        perhaps by September to forward a report to the Cabinet. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> asked that all agencies give the
                        Committee complete cooperation. He emphasized that this Committee does not
                        free the Government of its responsibility. On a request from Mr. <persName

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the United States
                        would not attempt to compete with Russia in every country on a dollar for
                        dollar basis although in India both Russia and the United States are
                        pursuing large programs. He took note of the project in Afghanistan for
                        construction of a university at Kabul which would be a useful and visible
                        program. He referred briefly to prospects of programs for Indonesia and
                        Yemen.</p>
                    <p>In addition to our reciprocal trade and mutual security programs, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said, we have now
                        undertaken to give better training to technicians going abroad, to find ways
                        better to use private enterprise as an antidote to the Soviet salesmanship
                        of State enterprise, and to discover a better handling of commodity trading
                        in the world so as to be helpful to underdeveloped countries that depend
                        upon selling basic commodities. Commodity trading, he stated, is a different
                        problem for each commodity, as witness coffee, lead and zinc, tin, aluminum.
                        On tin and aluminum, the solution may be (though we do not desire it) in
                        some sort of international body although it is not likely that the Soviet
                        would join such.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> concluded by noting that
                        the State Department organization is probably not adequate for handling this
                        matter, hence recommended changes may soon be brought forward.</p>

                            the Bloc at the expense of the West. Although involving economic benefit
                            to the Bloc, it is conducted as an integral part of the Bloc’s cold war
                            policy against the West. The underdeveloped countries, many of which
                            have economic and political grievances against the West, are being

                            attractive terms and, at the outset, with no apparent political
                            conditions, ([<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Although the economic program is of modest scope compared with the
                            total volume of world trade and capital flow, it has strengthened the
                            bargaining positions of certain of the underdeveloped countries
                            vis-à-vis the West, given some of them a capability to defy the West,
                            and helped to identify the Bloc with their nationalist aspirations.
                            Generally satisfactory performance in conducting its aid and trade
                            program has created for the Bloc an aura of respectability as a
                            legitimate business partner. Economic dealings have substantially
                            increased the ties of some countries with the Bloc, giving Bloc leaders
                            economic and political levers for future use. ([<hi rend="italic">less

                        <item>We believe that the Bloc leaders will intensify their economic
                            offensive, whether or not they shift to a harder general line toward the
                            major Western powers. Despite the requirements of the investment
                            programs within the Bloc, economic capabilities will impose no serious
                            limitation on the Bloc’s ability to continue, or even to double, its
                            present trade, aid, and technical assistance program, ([<hi

                        <item>Bloc leaders will continue to direct their economic offensive at those
                            Middle Eastern and Asian countries which now occupy their primary
                            attention, but will probably also show increasing interest in Turkey,
                            Greece, Latin America, and the emerging states of Africa. The Bloc may
                            achieve dramatic economic inroads in certain of these countries,
                            including some which have to date been closely tied to the West. ([<hi

                        <item>We believe, however, that the trade and aid program will not alone
                            cause any state to align itself with the Bloc in the near future. We
                            also believe that, with the passage of time, the Bloc economic drive may
                            lose some of its initial glamour and effectiveness. The Bloc, as in the
                            case of Yugoslavia, may not always fulfill its promises and it will not
                            satisfy all the hopes which it has aroused. Some underdeveloped
                            countries may in time become more wary and require more persuasion than
                            they do now to accept Bloc offers of trade and aid. ([<hi rend="italic"

                        <item>The long-run threat posed by the Bloc economic offensive will
                            nevertheless remain substantial. The economic offensive will operate in
                            a context in which the steady growth of the economic, military, and
                            scientific strength of the Bloc will make it a more formidable opponent
                            of the West in the underdeveloped countries. Bloc trade, credits, and
                            technical assistance will support the Bloc image of progress and power,
                            and will provide opportunities for the propagation of Communist doctrine
                            and the idea of rapid industrialization through the Soviet-type <pb

                            unless effectively countered, these psychological and economic inroads
                            will continue to erode the Western position in the underdeveloped world,

                                over together a number of minor linguistic changes that the
                                President had in mind. He indicated his approval generally of the
                                speech. He did, however, warn that the U.S. budgetary and credit
                                position was such that he felt he was going to have to put major
                                emphasis next year upon economy and upon balancing the budget.
                                Therefore, we did not want to give exaggerated hopes that there
                                would be large increases in foreign aid. According to the
                                President’s thinking we would go through with the increased capital
                                for the World Bank and Monetary Fund<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">At

                            day in Washington. The President said that was entirely agreeable with
                            him. He expected to have the speech “frozen” by then.</item>

                            themselves to be used in this way, the situation was indeed ominous. The
                            President agreed that the principal hope must be that there would be a
                            revolt on the part of the people. Otherwise, we would face a threat that
                            would be very difficult for us to meet in terms of our present form of

                    <p>[Here follows discussion of several unrelated subjects.]</p>
                    <p>6. I said that, with regard to the Mutual Security Program for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960, there has emerged disagreement between
                        the State Department and the Bureau of the Budget. While I would not ask for
                        a decision on the spur of the moment I would hope that the President would
                        give us our day in court before cuts are made as I believe that we cannot do
                        what we must do to lift the peoples of the underdeveloped nations up onto a
                        plane of economic dynamism with the cut in mutual security funds on which
                        the Bureau of the Budget is now insisting. Given the size of the resources
                        which the Soviets and the Chinese Communists are devoting to an economic
                        offensive in underdeveloped countries I thought that we must be prepared to
                        make some sacrifices if we are successfully to meet this competition. I
                        suggested that increased taxation, perhaps new forms of taxation such as a
                        national sales tax, might be envisaged.</p>
                    <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0069"/>
                    <p>The President agreed that the American people must better understand that
                        they may have to undergo sturdy measures in order to be successful in the
                        kind of world struggle in which we are engaged, and said that he felt this
                        should be made clear in his State of the Union Message. He noted two
                        conflicting elements of the problem: Indispensable confidence in the
                        economic health of the US and in the dollar will not endure unless we
                        balance our budget and correct our current unhealthy fiscal situation; at
                        the same time we must find the funds to assist in the economic development
                        of other countries. In this connection he referred to a letter which he had
                        had from Lewis Douglas (copy attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">Not
                            printed, but see <ref target="#d40">Document 40</ref>. Lewis W. Douglas
                            was former Ambassador to the United Kingdom.</note> about the importance
                        of the availability of dollars to the underdeveloped countries. He also
                        mentioned a letter he had had from Lamar Flemming about the difficulties
                        being experienced by American companies operating in Latin America.<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d16fn3">Not further identified.</note></p>
                    <p>The President also noted the political opposition in the US, as it is
                        expressed in Congressional attitudes, toward cutting budgets for domestic
                        programs in order to make funds available for Mutual Security Programs
                        within a balanced budget. Dr. Milton Eisenhower suggested the policy of a
                        two-year balanced budget, to get away from the problem of annually trying to
                        accomplish this end; the President acknowledged that multiple-year budget
                        balancing is intrinsically preferable but not sufficiently understood by the
                        public to be politically practicable. He asked that the views of Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> be sought on what
                        further could be done to accomplish the objectives we had discussed.</p>

                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> today to discuss with him the dual
                        problems of providing assistance to the underdeveloped countries and
                        counteracting the Sino-Soviet economic offensive. He said that his
                        Government was devoting considerable attention to this subject and was
                        anxious to obtain Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s views
                        in respect to it.</p>
                    <p>In response, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that
                        the need to assist the peoples of the newly emerging countries to achieve
                        economic progress would exist irrespective of the problems raised by the
                        Sino-Soviet bloc. The urgency of this requirement, however, had been
                        increased by the Communist economic offensive. In aiding the underdeveloped
                        countries we are not attempting to enlist them as allies but we are
                        attempting to strengthen them sufficiently to permit them to resist the
                        blandishments of the bloc countries. Although we do not engage in a
                        competitive effort in each of the underdeveloped countries to match Soviet
                        aid programs with programs of our own, we do point out to the governments of
                        those countries the political motivation and dangers of the Soviet economic
                        offers. The cases of Yugoslavia and Finland are examples of how the Russians
                        can turn the spigot of economic aid on and off depending upon political
                        decisions. Noting that Ambassador van Roijen had pointed out that the Soviet
                        had aid programs in about seventeen countries with particular weight in five
                        countries, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that it
                        could be anticipated that the Russians would soon announce that a
                        substantial aid program would begin in Iraq.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that it was clear
                        that the countries of the West would have to accelerate their efforts to
                        build an international framework within which the peoples of the
                        underdeveloped countries could, in freedom, realize their potential for
                        growth. There were various steps which would fit into a program of this
                        type. Fundamental to it would be the maintenance of growing economies and
                        expanding markets in the West in which the developing countries could place
                        their goods. More emphasis would have to be given to increasing trade
                        despite the political difficulties which always rise in the face of
                        increased commercial competition. By various means it would be necessary to
                        expand the flow of private capital into the underdeveloped areas. This would
                        involve tax and other incentives on the part of the West to stimulate the
                        capital movement and actions by the recipient countries to create a more
                        favorable climate for foreign investment. One aspect of the latter is the
                        development of technical and managerial skills which are vital to successful
                        economic enterprise.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the flow of private capital, Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName>
                        said, it is imperative to increase the supply of public capital to the new
                        nations on both a multilateral and bilateral basis. This includes the
                        provision of public loans on normal bankable terms through media such as the
                            <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0072"/><gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                            >IMF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and development
                        financing with flexible terms of payment through organizations such as the
                        Development Loan Fund and the proposed International Development
                        Association.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador van Roijen said that he fully concurred with the views expressed
                        by the Acting Secretary. He said that his Government has felt that <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss><note n="1" xml:id="d18fn1">Proposals
                            for a Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development had been
                            under study by the U.N. General Assembly and the Economic and Social
                            Council for several years.</note> could play a useful role in the effort
                        to provide financing assistance and he wondered if the US looked with
                        greater favor on this organization than it did in the past. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, in reply, said that US opposition
                        to <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> was unchanged. He pointed out
                        that Russian influence in the organization would far exceed the financial
                        contributions which Russia would be prepared to make to it. The US
                        inevitably would have to provide a relatively large proportion of the <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> funds and yet the Russians due to
                        their fractional contributions would be in a position to derive substantial
                        propaganda benefits from their association with the organization. Obtaining
                        Congressional support under these circumstances for US participation would
                        be virtually impossible. This did not mean, however, that the US opposed
                        capital financing through multilateral organizations. This Government, for
                        example, supported the proposals to create an International Development
                        Association closely affiliated with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                            >IBRD</gloss>. Since Russia is not a member of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, it would not participate in the new
                        Association.</p>
                    <p>Referring to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s address in
                        New Orleans on January 27,<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">For text of Dillon’s
                            address before the Mississippi Valley Trade Council in New Orleans on
                            January 27, see Department of State Bulletin, February 16, 1959, pp.
                            237–243.</note> Ambassador van Roijen said that he had been struck by
                        the description of his discussion with Mikoyan<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3"
                            >Anastas I. Mikoyan, First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of
                            Ministers, made an unofficial visit to the United States, January
                            4–20.</note> about the possibility of increasing US-Russian trade.
                        Mikoyan’s categoric insistence on long-term credits as a prior condition for
                        expanded trade indicated that the Russians were prepared to see such an
                        expansion only on their own politically motivated terms. Mikoyan’s complaint
                        that the US would not extend MFN treatment to Russia had a particularly
                        false ring when one reflected on the state trading monopoly which exists in
                        that country.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador stated that his Government had a natural concern about
                        Sino-Soviet activities in the raw material markets. In certain cases these
                        have been highly disruptive to commodity price structures. He wondered if
                        the US contemplated a general program of combatting the bloc’s forays into
                        these markets.</p>
                    <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0073"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that considerable
                        attention was being devoted to commodity market questions. It did not seem
                        feasible in view of the variety of problems involved, however, to attempt to
                        develop an overall program to counteract the bloc. It seems more practical
                        to approach this subject on an ad hoc basis. He said that he was not certain
                        in his own mind that the Russians had entered individual commodity markets
                        with the express purpose of wrecking the price structure by dumping
                        operations. However, since prices do not play a controlling role in their
                        export program, their movement into the international commodity markets have
                        had the same effect as deliberate dumping. Their sales of tin and aluminum,
                        for example, have been harmful to Bolivia, Malaya, Indonesia and Canada.
                        When the reactions in those countries proved harmful to the Soviet
                        propaganda position, the pressures on the commodity markets were eased. It
                        is apparent, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> added, that
                        the Russians have the capacity to disrupt the petroleum market. At least one
                        restraint on a petroleum dumping operation, however, is that its effects
                        would be particularly harmful to the Arab World which the Russians are
                        making a major effort to influence.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador van Roijen said that in view of the continuing nature of the
                        Sino-Soviet economic offensive he thought it would be desirable to consider
                        the feasibility of coordinating the counteractive efforts of the West on a
                        multilateral basis. Perhaps, he suggested, this might be done in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that although he
                        doubted the feasibility of utilizing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        as an economic warfare unit he felt that it might be useful to disseminate
                        in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> information in respect to the
                        Sino-Soviet economic threats. He believed that certain of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries might collaborate in blunting
                        particular aspects of the bloc offensive. In view, however, of the potential
                        sensitivities of the underdeveloped countries, it would not appear desirable
                        for this collaboration to occur under the aegis of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In closing, the Acting Secretary told Ambassador van Roijen that he would
                        welcome any suggestions or ideas which the Netherlands Government may have
                        in respect to the serious problems involved in the Sino-Soviet efforts to
                        subvert the underdeveloped areas. He said that he would be happy to discuss
                        them with the Ambassador or to have the Ambassador’s staff raise them with
                        Mr. <persName>Terrill</persName> who is coordinating the Department’s
                        position on these matters.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The meeting opened with the Prime Minister saying that it would be helpful to
                        have a discussion about the economic picture, in its broad aspect, and what
                        the President sees as the temper or trend of the United States economic
                        story.</p>
                    <p>He went on to say that from their point of view, the capital aspect is
                        good—the World Bank has been stepped up and so on but we don’t really worry
                        so much about capital. We, the United Kingdom, want to be able to sell the
                        commodities that we produce. He explained that he understood the
                        difficulties faced by the United States in these matters.</p>
                    <p>The President accepted the statement as being a fair statement, and
                        especially fair in that the Prime Minister made it clear that he appreciated
                        the United States problem. The President then went on to outline the curious
                        legal restrictions imposed on his actions, his decisions, by the set-up of
                        our laws—especially the way in which the Tariff Commission worked. He wasn’t
                        able to be absolutely accurate as to the number of times he had ruled
                        against—or failed to accept the recommendations of the Tariff Commission,
                        but it certainly was in the order of 10 agreements vs. 150 findings against
                        in his ruling re escape clause. He went on to describe this Administration
                        as one devoted to liberal trade policy. We have now the oil restriction-a
                        few companies had broken the voluntary disciplines which the industry had
                        self-imposed, but these few so clearly menaced the others that he had been
                        forced to a mandatory imposition of restrictions. Now this will raise hell
                        in Canada, Mexico, Venezuela—our friends, but it had to be.</p>
                    <p>The next, the current study of the electrical industries as a whole-is of the
                        greatest significance. But it is under study and the international aspects
                        of it are clearly understood to be of the first importance.</p>
                    <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0075"/>
                    <p>Further, the United States is, by and large, devoted to liberal trade. The
                        President said never has he worked harder for anything than he has in
                        getting this Reciprocal Trade Act extended for four years.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d19fn2">The Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1958 (P.L. 85–686;

                            to enter into reciprocal foreign trade agreements. (72 Stat. 673)</note>
                        A great victory for our cause—but, the fact that he could win it was a
                        demonstration of the temper, the national understanding that liberal trade
                        policies were sound.</p>
                    <p>However, the President continued, when the individual gets hurt—then hell
                        breaks out—and he recited many examples of his battles over small
                        industries. Their importance is nil in the whole picture—their political
                        irritation point, acute.</p>
                    <p>The President then discussed at length the present dilemma of current United
                        States free enterprise—in theory and practice. The wage—price spiral is in
                        full upward swing. Nowhere is there the will to slow it down, in spite of
                        his efforts to dramatize the fact that we are pricing—costing ourselves out
                        of world competition.</p>
                    <p>The unions make wild claims for their bigger share, based on the fact that
                        the companies are declaring bigger profits and they want more of them. They
                        forget that the Federal Government depends on profits. We live by income
                        tax—private and corporate.</p>
                    <p>By and large, said the President, Americans look to the Administration to
                        protect their national and international interests. They look to their
                        Congressmen to protect their own. If the Congressman doesn’t satisfy them,
                        then the President must.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then recited how the British system put all the onus of
                        appropriations requests of money on the Government. Nobody could even lay
                        down an amendment to a bill if it increased the appropriation submitted.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would like this. In fact, he would settle for the item
                        veto approach.</p>

                        for real trouble,” since many experts considered it had “bitten off rather
                        more obligations than we can chew.” For the relevant portion of the

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, after an exchange of
                        courtesies, invited Minister Erhard to begin the discussions. The Minister
                        stated he would first summarize the highlights of his meetings earlier that
                        day with U.S. officials.<note n="1" xml:id="d21fn1">A memorandum of a
                            conversation that day between Minister Erhard and members of the Council
                            of Economic Advisers is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. An extract of the
                            memorandum of a conversation the same day among Erhard, Secretary

                        He referred to the importance of the stability of the dollar. He said that
                        in his conversations he had made the point that with the <pb n="45"
                            xml:id="pg_45" facs="0077"/>disappearance of the gold standard, the
                        dollar had become the world—wide economic measuring stick and that it was of
                        utmost importance that the dollar should be protected. The Minister said
                        that in taking the action necessary to protect our currencies, the United
                        States Government and the German Government, as well as all other
                        governments, must thwart selfish forces which are trying to advance their
                        own interests by hindering the operation of free economy forces.</p>
                    <p>The Minister summarized the need for aid to less developed countries and
                        pointed out that our motives must not be only humanitarian but also
                        political since our future is very closely bound up with what happens to
                        these underdeveloped areas. He said that he had been discussing the
                        International Development Association with the House Foreign Affairs
                        Committee earlier in the day and that he found a good deal of sympathy there
                        with the idea. He said that there was also support for <gloss
                            target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> in Germany but as yet there has been no
                        cabinet decision concerning German participation.</p>
                    <p>Minister Erhard then referred to the German coal import restrictions and said
                        that the restrictions had been imposed because of the huge pit—head
                        accumulations of coal and threat of labor unrest in the Ruhr. He said that
                        the German action on coal did not indicate a change in economic policy but
                        that it was made principally for internal political reasons. He added that
                        progress is being made in modernizing German coal mining and in eliminating
                        uneconomic mines but that he did not want to exaggerate the amount of
                        progress. The Minister said that in the case of coal import contracts which
                        are being cancelled, honorable business practices are being followed by the
                        Germans in paying penalties.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he understood
                        that Minister Erhard had recently travelled extensively in Asia and that the
                        meeting would be interested in hearing any observations the Minister might
                        wish to make on economic aid for such areas. The Minister said that he found
                        these countries wide open to Soviet influence. Soviet representatives are
                        working hard to advance their interests in such areas and if we are to
                        protect our political future we must act wisely and quickly. He said that we
                        must not make the mistake of trying to impose our institutions and customs
                        on these societies. We must help them but we must help them in a way that is
                        compatible with their pattern of life. The Minister said that if the aid
                        given is government—to-government aid there is a likelihood of suspicion on
                        the part of the receiving country that political motives are foremost. There
                        is also the possibility of embarrassment for the donor countries in such
                        situations. The Minister said he thought it was better whenever possible to
                        have aid made available through private commercial channels or through
                        multilateral organizations.</p>
                    <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0078"/>
                    <p>One of the great problems in this connection, Minister Erhard thought, was
                        that the less developed countries are anxious to move very fast. They are
                        aware of the wide gap between their own economic situations and those of the
                        Western countries and they are extremely anxious to close the gap. He said
                        that in the less developed countries of the world attention is now riveted
                        on China and India. The success of the totalitarian Communist approach in
                        China as compared with the liberal capitalist approach in India may set the
                        pattern for economic development in many other parts of the world. The
                        Minister said that if the less developed countries followed the totalitarian
                        path, Europe will fall before their weight in a relatively short time.</p>
                    <p>Minister Erhard said he believed we had found government—to-government aid
                        often presented serious difficulties and that perhaps we would agree with
                        him that a multilateral aid organization can function more effectively in
                        terms of free world interests. Minister Erhard said such an institution
                        could exert pressures that could not be exerted by individual governments
                        and added that the provision of capital without the necessary discipline on
                        the part of the receiving country is particularly undesirable. He went on to
                        point out that he was not saying that we had to choose between multilateral
                        and bilateral government-to-government arrangements since he thought there
                        was room for both. However, he preferred the multilateral approach where
                        governments of lending countries were involved. He would like to see the
                        emphasis in that direction with a clearing house in Washington, operated
                        either by the World Bank or the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. The
                        Minister said he thought the contributing countries could get together and
                        plan aid programs and perhaps assign certain areas to certain contributing
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>The Minister said that we must help the less developed countries
                        industrialize but we should not encourage the immediate establishment of big
                        industries. He said he thought it was better in such countries to have
                        simultaneous development of a number of smaller industries so that a sound
                        organic growth of the social economy could take place. Techniques, skills
                        and knowledge would be acquired by many more people where small diversified
                        enterprises are involved. During his tour in Asia, he had concluded that the
                        only important resentment carried over from the colonial period was in
                        connection with the countries’ feeling they had been left with the burden of
                        a one-crop economy and that they had to import much of their food and
                        practically all their industrial needs. The Minister said that he thought it
                        was desirable that these countries be enabled to improve their agricultural
                        methods so that they would not be as dependent on imported foods. In
                        addition, they also need to industrialize. He said that these countries in
                        many cases have good craftsmen and that we should try to build on this asset
                        by helping them establish healthy small industries. <pb n="47"
                            xml:id="pg_47" facs="0079"/>The Minister said we must apply a great deal
                        of imagination to help develop these people into full-fledged consumers. He
                        said that with development in this direction we must realize that we will
                        have to accept changes in our own industrial structure if we wish to keep
                        the free world together.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that since the end of
                        the war the U.S. had had a good deal of experience with economic aid and
                        that we had modified our program in the light of that experience. He said
                        that some of our disappointments had come as a result of economic programs
                        which had to be undertaken on a crash basis as a result of political or
                        military crises. Where there is an opportunity to plan ahead he would be in
                        complete agreement with what Minister Erhard had said. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that one of the dangers we face
                        is that Asians, for instance, come to the U.S. and find our methods and our
                        economy so far beyond their own that they come to the conclusion that it is
                        hopeless to try to follow our example. They find that Communist China, for
                        example, seems to present a much more realizable goal, taking into
                        consideration their own starting point. Minister Erhard said that a proposal
                        was now before the German parliament to make certain guarantees for private
                        investments in less developed countries. He thought that such a move was
                        desirable and would increase Germany’s contribution toward the solution of
                        the problem.</p>
                    <p>The Minister said that the people in the receiving countries must see
                        improvement not only in statistics but in their personal lives. For this
                        reason, he felt that it was often mistaken to direct our aid toward foreign
                        government planning agencies which might put money into prestige projects
                        which would have very little effect in the foreseeable future on the lives
                        of individuals in the country. He emphasized again his conviction that by
                        channeling aid through private groups the opportunities for affecting
                        individual lives in the receiving countries were greatly increased.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJW1">Riddleberger</persName> commented that the
                        German Government had recently guaranteed private export credits to Greece
                        amounting to about $48 million. He said that it was his understanding that
                        the Greeks were using the credits for importing consumers’ goods and that
                        the drachmas resulting from their sale would be used for industrial
                        development. He said this arrangement was somewhat surprising to him.
                        Minister Erhard said that as far as he knew the credit was not tied to
                        consumers’ goods but that it was a choice which the Greek Government had
                        made. Perhaps by applying the credits to consumers’ goods they were able to
                        liberate other funds for industrial application.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UTG1">Upton</persName> said that the development of
                            <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> would probably mean the growth in
                        number of loans to a given country and asked whether this perhaps might be a
                        danger. Minister Erhard said that it was true that a number of smaller loans
                        made the matter of control <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0080"/>more
                        difficult but that while, from a financial and administrative point of view,
                        it might be simpler to have a few large loans, such an arrangement might not
                        meet the actual economic needs of a country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJO1">Bell</persName> said that he was particularly
                        interested in knowing what the Minister thought could be done to make people
                        more aware of the aid being supplied. Minister Erhard replied that in many
                        of our aid programs the donor countries seemed to be in a competition with
                        one another to render aid. He thought that such an attitude has a very
                        unfortunate effect on the recipient countries and that we must establish the
                        fact that we are interested in aiding the receiving countries, not in
                        gaining some advantage for ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kearns</persName> asked what the Minister
                        thought the relative force of protectionist and free trade influences was in
                        the Common Market. The Minister answered that the treaty of the Common
                        Market does not provide for protectionism. When the treaty was entered into,
                        the countries in the Common Market were not of the same economic philosophy
                        but the situation has improved with French reform of exchange rates and
                        import restrictions. He said it is still important to try to get the Common
                        Market and the non-Common Market countries together. He said that it was his
                        opinion that the non-six among the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>
                        countries in Europe were too heterogeneous a group to be able to form their
                        own organization. The Minister said that last January when the first tariff
                        reductions took place in the Common Market countries, the six decided to
                        give these same reductions to the non-Common Market countries. He said that
                        he considered this an indication of the long-run attitude of the Common
                        Market which will have the goal of free trade. He said that the world has
                        become so small that we cannot afford closed groups such as some people fear
                        the Common Market might become. He said that a European preferential system
                        is not the aim of the Common Market but the hope is that the development of
                        the Common Market will be accompanied by a general relaxing of trade
                        barriers.</p>
                    <p>In response to a request by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                        >Murphy</persName>, Mr. <persName>Terrill</persName><note n="2"
                            xml:id="d21fn2">Robert P. Terrill.</note> explained that the commitment
                        of the Soviet Government under the seven-year plan will mean enormous need
                        for capital goods. He said that it had been noted that the Soviets in their
                        plan have not increased provisions for exports to earn foreign currency. As
                        a result they are looking for outside capital and credits. Whatever they do
                        export on a large scale will probably be sent to the less developed
                        countries for political motives. For these reasons Mr.
                            <persName>Terrill</persName> said that he felt it was important that we
                        should not facilitate Soviet reaching of objectives by supplying them with
                        credits.</p>
                    <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0081"/>
                    <p>Minister Erhard replied by saying that he agreed with this analysis,
                        particularly in respect to withholding products concerning which we have an
                        advantage over the Soviets. The Minister said that he also agreed that it
                        was undesirable to give credits to the Soviet Union. He urged that a common
                        policy be agreed within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on this
                        subject and this policy be adhered to by all the participating countries.
                        Otherwise, some governments, such as the Federal Republic, might be placed
                        in the position of discriminating against their own suppliers. Minister
                        Erhard said that when the Soviet-German trade agreement was signed, and the
                        figure of DM 500 million in annual trade was established, the Germans had a
                        very difficult time trying to reach that volume. He said that all the
                        Soviets wanted to sell was coal and oil. The Minister then went on to say
                        that what would really make him applaud the Soviets would be their improving
                        consumer welfare. He said that there was definitely a push for better life
                        within the Soviet Union but it was not possible to tell how potent these
                        forces are or how far they would go to achieve their objective.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Miller</persName> said that there was interest in the American
                        agricultural community as to what the effect of the Common Market would be
                        on our agricultural exports. Minister Erhard replied that there was
                        protection of agricultural items in the Common Market and he asked if Mr.
                            <persName>Miller</persName> could name any country that does not protect
                        its agricultural producers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked the Minister why he
                        thought the Soviets chose this particular time to raise the Berlin problem.
                        The Minister replied that he sees the Soviet move as part of a whole pattern
                        of East-West tensions. On his recent trip to Iran, he found that the
                        Persians believe that the Russians moved against Berlin in order to distract
                        attention from expected moves in the Near and Middle East. He said that the
                        Russians have found that we are not soft regarding Berlin and that they must
                        now discover a graceful way of retreating. In so doing, they would pose as
                        the champions of peace. He said that the Russians turn truthfulness and
                        morality upside down. They thought that by their timing of this maneuver
                        they might have some chance of splitting the West at a time when elections
                        were being held in England and other countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FI1">Frank</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3"
                            >Presumably <persName corresp="#p_FI1">Isaiah Frank</persName>, Deputy
                            Director of the Office of International Trade.</note> said that we all
                        were gratified at the end of the recent <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> meeting to find Germany was able to liberalize further and
                        that Dr. Erhard’s promotion of convertibility had been so successful.
                        However, we were disturbed by the residue of bilateralism which remained in
                        German trade policies and that we felt that such arrangements could not be
                        justified any longer on the basis of balance of payments problems. Minister
                        Erhard replied that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FI1">Frank</persName> was
                        correct in principle <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0082"/>but that he must
                        realize that the economic situation in each country requires special study.
                        The Minister said that the U.S. practices protectionism to some extent as
                        does every other country. He said that he is glad that <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> is in existence and believes it is doing
                        a good job but that the organization cannot take care of all the complicated
                        problems existing in each country’s economy. He said that the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> rules were particularly hard to apply to
                        countries in transition toward a mature economy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWTM1">Beale</persName> said that he and the rest
                        of the American delegation at Geneva were most appreciative of the excellent
                        job which the German delegation had done in Geneva under the leadership of
                        Dr. Klein and that we were grateful for what Minister Erhard had done in
                        resolving the problems which remained at the end of the meeting. Minister
                        Erhard thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWTM1">Beale</persName> for the
                        important contribution he had made to the successful negotiations in
                        Geneva.</p>
                    <p>(During the course of the meeting the Minister received a three-page telegram
                        which, it later became known, contained the first news of <persName
                            corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s decision to remain Chancellor.
                        The Minister carried on the balance of the discussion without being visibly
                        affected.)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> made it clear that no
                        decisions were being sought at this meeting, but that it seemed desirable to
                        keep the Cabinet informed of this very sensitive <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51"
                            facs="0083"/>problem. He thought that study of the problem ought to be
                        continued on a very high level of government until any necessary decisions
                        were made.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then reviewed the
                        situation generally, stressing that the dollar gap no longer exists with
                        regard to the industrial countries of Western Europe and that for the
                        underdeveloped countries, it is a capital gap rather than a dollar gap,
                        meaning that British pounds or German marks, etc., will serve equally well
                        as dollars. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> reviewed the
                        situation of foreign holdings of United States dollars in much the same
                        terms as at the Cabinet presentation some months earlier.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d22fn1">On March 13; see <ref target="#d44">Document
                            44</ref>.</note> He stated that the gold outflow had not been large in
                        the first quarter this year but that it had increased somewhat in the second
                        quarter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> pointed out that the
                        balance of trade does remain in our favor by a slight margin but that other
                        outgoing payments, such as United States troop support, tourist
                        expenditures, private investment overseas, and utilization of P.L. 480
                        payments, produce a deficit for us in the balance of payments.</p>
                    <p>He noted that foreign countries do most of their financing in short term
                        loans, whereas much of our lending is long term.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> asserted that we have
                        reached the point where it is necessary to re-examine the kinds of things we
                        are doing, including the problems we generate for ourselves. He thought that
                        export increases as large as could reasonably be hoped for would still be
                        insufficient to solve the problem. He felt that our allies must share more
                        and on a longer term in providing capital to underdeveloped countries, and
                        we need to bring about a change in their point of view. Also, it is
                        important that the other free nations of the world liberalize many of their
                        policies toward the United States, such as quotas against American
                        automobiles, high tariffs, etc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UTG1">Upton</persName> then presented a series of
                        charts giving the statistical backup for Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName>’s presentation.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then summarized three
                        areas of possible action: (1) other countries should eliminate quotas and
                        reduce tariffs on American goods, they should bear a larger share of
                        military costs, and they should have a larger part in helping underdeveloped
                        countries; (2) private business in the United States should be encouraged to
                        develop a new state of mind toward increasing exports of American goods and
                        being competitive with overseas rivals, also the activity of the
                        Export-Import Bank should be increased; (3) the federal government must
                        maintain its will and capacity to control inflation and insure that other
                        countries know this, it should reexamine its military expenditures overseas,
                        and it should make a rigid review of Development Loan <pb n="52"
                            xml:id="pg_52" facs="0084"/>Fund activities, including attention to
                        insuring that government loans are utilized in such a way as to increase
                        procurement from the United States; similarly, P.L. 480 sales need to be
                        reexamined. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> noted in
                        passing that the practices of U.S. industries in establishing overseas
                        factories have resulted in some lack of concern with tailoring U.S.
                        production for overseas markets.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> and the President
                        ascertained that the P.L. 480 problem appeared primarily in terms of barter

                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> urged that study of the
                        problem be continued through the mechanism of the National Advisory Council
                        on International Monetary and Financial Affairs, with other interested
                        officials to be included on an ad hoc basis. The major conclusions and
                        recommendations when necessary would be brought to the President for
                        approval.</p>
                    <p>The President recalled how the United States had tried to grant funds without
                        attaching strings but that it now seemed desirable to review that policy.
                        Any change that might result, however, need not be a sudden one, hence the
                        State Department should not be overly concerned. The President called
                        attention to Russian practices in this regard.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> was invited to comment and he expressed his
                        concurrence in the importance and validity of Sec. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>’s remarks. He felt this balance of
                        payments matter had to be considered in all of our domestic and foreign
                        activities.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SRJ1">Saulnier</persName> stated that the Council
                        of Economic Advisors had been working on the problem and is participating in
                        the work of the Committee chaired by Assistant Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KH1">Kearns</persName> of Commerce on the limited problem of
                        exports. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SRJ1">Saulnier</persName> believed that
                        it was an overstatement to describe the situation in terms of “we have
                        priced ourselves out of world markets,” since that is not the whole story.
                        He too stressed the psychological aspects of the problem. He thought that
                        the steel dispute and outcome was extremely significant since it was
                        painfully evident that we had lost a competitive advantage in this
                        particular <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0085"/>industry. A rise in the
                        price of steel because of this dispute would be very disadvantageous in the
                        light of the balance of payments problem.</p>
                    <p>The President referred to the copies of Chester Bowles’<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d22fn3">Representative from Connecticut; the letter is not
                            further identified.</note> letter that he had sent to interested
                        officials, urging that the steel industry ought to reduce prices $10 per
                        ton. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SRJ1">Saulnier</persName> believed that a
                        good argument could be made for this action. The President noted how he was
                        endeavoring to avoid any charges of favoritism in the steel dispute, since
                        he did not feel that he could approach any of the steel leaders, even for
                        the purpose of passing along Chester Bowles’ suggestion. The President
                        concluded his remarks by referring to the great inflation that has occurred
                        in recent months as regards defense procurement.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> came to see me to
                        discuss our over-all financial situation and to deplore recent publicity
                        which would indicate a split between Treasury and State. After explaining at
                        length our balance of payments situation and the probable imbalance in our
                        budget during the current year, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> pointed out the overriding necessity of maintaining
                        a sound dollar. He indicated his complete devotion to freer trade theories
                        and felt that these did not in any way conflict with the necessary fiscal
                        measures which he felt we had to take from the point of view of protecting
                        our balance of payments. I told him that I thought it was very important
                        that the distinction be drawn between the maintenance of freer trade and
                        such restrictive measures as we had to apply on use of dollar loans in the
                        U.S.</p>
                    <p>He told me that he had given orders in the Treasury that no statement should
                        be made anywhere along the line which would indicate any friction or which
                        would overemphasize recent decisions, such as that related to the
                        Development Loan Fund,<note n="1" xml:id="d24fn1"><gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                                >DLF</gloss> Managing Director Vance Brand had announced on October
                            20 that the Fund would thereafter place primary emphasis on the
                            financing of goods and services of U.S. origin.</note> and hoped very
                        much that the State Department could do likewise. He did not want <pb n="56"
                            xml:id="pg_56" facs="0088"/>any such frictions to develop at the lower
                        levels and thought that, whenever possible difficulties arose, we ought to
                        work them out by discussion among ourselves.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the above, we discussed the budgetary problems of the Defense
                        Department and the political implications of possible cutbacks in our <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments. He agreed that this matter
                        should be gone over soon with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1"
                            >McElroy</persName> and myself and agreement has now been reached for a
                        meeting Saturday morning, October 24.</p>

                        <item>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PD1">Paarlberg</persName> stated that the
                            competitive situation of exports of the United States has been
                            deteriorating while at the same time our imports are increasing, thus
                            sharply reducing our favorable balance of trade. This represents a
                            threat to our whole economy and reduces substantially our capability for
                            providing economic assistance to the underdeveloped countries. Dr.
                            Paarlberg said that because of the deficit <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57"
                                facs="0089"/>in the balance of payments, there was now a need to
                            recast our foreign economic policy, and that while he did not think that
                            we should embark on a policy of protectionism, there were certain things
                            which we might consider doing. He suggested that the U.S. should examine

                            the U.S. should, to the extent possible, be tied to U.S. procurement.

                            of serious harm to our exports and those of other friendly countries
                            outside Europe?</item>

                    <p>The European Economic Community (The Six), which the United States has
                        strongly supported for political as well as economic reasons, is now being
                        challenged by a new trade bloc of seven European countries (The Seven) under
                        the de facto leadership of the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>The antagonisms between the Six and the Seven might develop into a trade war
                        which could gravely divide our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        partners on political and security issues.</p>
                    <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0091"/>
                    <p>On the other hand, the Six and the Seven might feel compelled to compose
                        their differences by trade deals which would discriminate against the
                        exports of the United States and other friendly countries.</p>
                    <p>To help guide present European trade developments into more constructive
                        channels beneficial to world trade will require the United States to abandon
                        its present passive role and exercise determined leadership.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State has considered carefully the courses of action open
                        to the United States in attacking successfully these major new problems in
                        the field of development and trade. We have concluded that the most
                        effective course would be for the United States to take the initiative in
                        proposing the reorganization and revitalization of the Organization for
                        European Economic Cooperation (<gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>) and to
                        announce the willingness of the United States to assume full membership in
                        this revitalized institution. (The United States and Canada now participate
                        only in an associate capacity.)</p>
                    <p>This action would symbolize our determination to work with Western Europe on
                        the basis of full partnership in attacking the major problems of development
                        and trade. It would constitute an act of creative United States leadership
                        in a recently deteriorating situation. It would greatly increase the
                        opportunity of the United States to influence the makers of European
                        economic policy in two directions—greater European development efforts and
                        actions to compose European trade quarrels on a basis consistent with sound
                        world trade relations.</p>
                    <p>A reorganized <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> would need to have a new
                        name, and would have to provide for some form of participation by Japan.</p>
                    <p>United States membership in a reorganized <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                            >OEEC</gloss> would require some form of Congressional action. However,
                        United States commitments would not go beyond acceptance of basic objectives
                        and agreement to discuss and provide information. It is assumed that Canada
                        would follow the United States lead and also become a full member.</p>

                            <item>Looking ahead over the next two or three years, there appear to be
                                two major problem areas in our international economic relations for
                                which present United States policies, and the institutions for
                                implementing effective policies, are both inadequate. These two
                                problem areas are: (1) the need for a much larger flow of
                                development assistance to the less-developed areas from the <hi
                                    rend="italic">other</hi> industrialized countries, especially
                                Western Europe, and for harmonizing development assistance policies
                                among the industrialized countries; and (2) the need for preventing
                                the emerging trade arrangements within Western Europe from gravely
                                damaging either United States world-wide commercial policies and
                                objectives or <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> political
                                cooperation.</item>

                            <item>With respect to the problem of development assistance, the United
                                States has so far failed to devise an approach which would be
                                effective either in getting the Europeans to step up their long-term
                                development assistance, or in creating a suitable forum for the
                                discussion of basic policies to guide development lending.
                                Consideration is being given to using the Executive Directors of the
                                International Bank (or of the new <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                                    >IDA</gloss>) for these purposes. It seems clear, however, that
                                the Bank mechanism cannot fully accomplish these objectives for
                                three main reasons. First, while the Bank could be very helpful as a
                                clearing house for information of a statistical nature, it is a
                                lending institution rather than a policy organization. Second, under
                                the Bank’s structure, power is heavily concentrated in the hands of
                                the management, with relatively little left to the Executive
                                Directors. And, third, the Executive Directors of countries or areas
                                other than the United States are not persons of adequate
                                responsibility in their own governments such as would enable them to
                                speak with authority or influence on the subject of over-all
                                development lending policies of their governments. The <gloss

                                having specific responsibilities in the field of development is
                                obviously unsuitable because of its unwieldy structure, the
                                character of governmental representation, and the presence of the
                                Communists.</item>

                            <item>With respect to present European trade developments, there are two
                                problems. One is that the trade rivalry between the Common Market
                                (The Six) and the new European Free Trade Area (The Seven) may
                                embitter intra-European political cooperation and may react against
                                the United States, which has so far refrained from any effort to
                                compose these differences in a constructive manner. The other
                                problem is that the Europeans <hi rend="italic">will</hi> compose
                                their differences, without <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0093"
                                />United States participation, by means of discriminatory
                                arrangements which would seriously hurt the trading interests of the
                                United States and other friendly countries outside of Europe. This
                                would undermine our multilateral trade policies as reflected in
                                    <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. Unfortunately, these two
                                problems cannot be adequately solved through <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> alone because of the presence in
                                    <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> of a large number of
                                non-European countries and because the European representatives in
                                    <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> are not the officials who
                                determine intra-European trade policies.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>If these two vital problems in the field of development and trade
                                are not dealt with through cooperative action, they could lead to a
                                serious decline in the rate of economic growth of the Free World
                                (which must be increased in the face of the Communist threat) and to
                                sharply divisive political wrangles within Western Europe and
                                between Europe and America which would inevitably weaken the <gloss

                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>It is believed our best hope for attacking these two problems is
                                through a reorganization of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                    >OEEC</gloss> and through the assumption by the United States
                                (and Canada) of full membership in place of our present associate
                                status. With the achievement of European recovery, the cessation of
                                United States economic assistance to Western Europe, and the
                                dissolution of regional trade and payments arrangements in Europe,
                                the original task of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> has
                                been completed. Nevertheless the quality of the secretariat of the
                                organization, the fact that <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>
                                meetings are normally attended by Ministers and senior officials
                                responsible for governmental economic policies, and the geographic
                                scope of the organization (which embraces the whole of the
                                industrialized world except Japan), mean that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> could become a really effective

                    <p>In response to your request of yesterday, I hereby submit the following
                        observations.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the economic relations between the United States and
                        Western Europe it is obvious that in the coming years we will be in great
                        straits to keep our balance of payments in such shape that we can maintain
                        the free convertibility of a hard dollar and stick to a liberal trade
                        policy. We have spent some $80 billion to get the Europeans on the road
                        toward rising productivity, expansion, and <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65"
                            facs="0097"/>hard freely convertible currencies. We have given them
                        since 1948 the last word in our technology free of charge and our industries
                        are investing over there to get more of it to them.</p>
                    <p>The Europeans, particularly the French and the Germans, but also the
                        Belgians, the Swiss, and the Italians, do not fully understand yet that we
                        are in a tough spot and need their cooperation for their own sake and
                        security at least as much as for our own. They do not realize that unless
                        they revise their policies they will drive the U.S. sooner or later to the
                        same tragic situation which led to the collapse of the World Economic
                        Conference in 1933 in London which blew up because the U.S. unilaterally did
                        what Britain had done previously, namely, it devalued the currency. If this
                        should arise again, it would do its part to blow up <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and start the march on the slippery downgrade in the cold
                        war.</p>
                    <p>If this situation shall be corrected and our burden be lightened, it calls
                        for action on both sides, in Europe as well as the U.S.</p>

                        countries want to do their part to shut their industrial goods out of the
                        U.S. market (as the result of the U.S. internal politics and Congressional
                        developments), all they have to do is to go ahead with their emancipation of
                        their common market for agricultural products and the discrimination against
                        all non-member nations, which includes the U.S.</p>
                    <p>I consider this situation as extremely dangerous because it is politically
                        most difficult to unlodge the agricultural interests from their new
                        protectionist position in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> once they
                        have entrenched themselves in it. This is just as much a fact in Continental
                        Europe as it is in the U.S. The European farm organizations, particularly in
                        France and Germany, are past masters in the riot techniques and all sorts of
                        revolutionary pressure group tactics.</p>
                    <p>This is perhaps the last moment for averting the drift into new belligerent

                        countries. It should be utilized. To utilize it requires the abandonment of
                        kid-glove tactfulness and fear of resentment of “dollar diplomacy”, etc. In
                        the best interest of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries
                        themselves, the U.S. should use maximum moral suasion and sternest warning

                    <p>The U.S. balance-of-payments deficit concerned the administration
                        increasingly in 1960. Documentation on this subject is in the compilation on
                        international financial and monetary policy, but material in other
                        compilations also reflects this concern. Efforts to increase U.S. exports
                        are documented in the compilation on trade policy. The compilations on
                        Mutual Security and on investment and development include material
                        concerning the impact of economic and military assistance on the balance of

                    <p>On November 16, when gold withdrawals from the United States were increasing
                        sharply, the President issued a directive declaring that it was “imperative
                        that the United States give the very highest priority to attaining a
                        reasonable equilibrium in its international balance of payments.” It
                        outlined steps to be taken or intensified with respect to international
                        trade, international finance, and the domestic economy, and it directed the
                        heads of various agencies to take specific steps to reduce expenditures
                        outside the United States, including reduction of the number of dependents
                        of military and civilian personnel abroad, reduction of overseas
                        procurement, and the requirement that the International Cooperation
                        Administration and the Development Loan Fund place primary emphasis on
                        financing goods and services of U.S. origin. For text of the directive, see

                    </list>
                    <p>The recent sharp increase in the United States balance of payments deficit as
                        a result of a large outflow of short-term funds confirms the long recognized
                        need for closer coordination of economic policies between the key countries
                        of Western Europe and the United States. Now that the currencies of the
                        major industrial countries are freely convertible I believe the need for
                        this coordination is more pressing than at any time since the war.</p>
                    <p>If such coordination existed it well might have produced the required
                        concerted action on monetary policy to have curbed this outflow. It might,
                        for example, have achieved concerted action on short-term interest rates
                        here and abroad. It also might have been instrumental in dissuading the
                        Italians from converting their dollar reserves into gold. It most certainly
                        could have served to assure other countries that the United States had no
                        intention of devaluing the dollar.</p>
                    <p>The need for closer economic coordination with the key countries of Western
                        Europe promises to be of particular urgency for the United States in the
                        months immediately ahead. Whatever progress the United States may continue
                        to make in remedying its basic balance of payments difficulties, its
                        reserves will remain vulnerable to short-term raids, as during the third
                        quarter of this year, because of differences in interest rates here and
                        abroad, lack of confidence in the dollar etc.</p>
                    <p>Such outflows if they occur, even though temporary, will complicate the
                        solution of the longer term payments problem and pose the further risk of
                        forcing the United States Government to adopt counter-measures which could
                        undermine some of our important foreign policy objectives. Concern about our
                        balance of payments situation could <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0101"
                        />also handicap the new administration if, for example, it decides it is
                        necessary to maintain low interest rates in order to stimulate domestic
                        business activity.</p>
                    <p>I realize a forum for economic policy coordination between the major Western
                        powers now exists in the Economic Policy Committee of the <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and will be established in the <gloss
                            target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. However, this forum is too large and
                        unwieldy to yield the kind of quick action required to deal with problems
                        such as short-term capital flows. What is needed, as suggested in
                            Bowie’s<note n="1" xml:id="d30fn1">Former Assistant Secretary of State

                            >The North Atlantic Nations Tasks for the 1960’s</hi> is a smaller more
                        informal body possibly consisting of senior treasury and central bank
                        officials of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and
                        Italy. While the inclusion of Japan also might be desirable this probably
                        would make it more difficult at this stage to enlist the full cooperation of
                        the other participants.</p>
                    <p>Such a small high level group could provide an effective forum for
                        consultations on a frank and open basis of all contemplated courses of
                        action in the field of monetary and fiscal policy with a view to minimizing
                        their balance of payments impact.</p>
                    <p>While the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                            >OECD</gloss> Economic Policy Committee is too large for the purposes
                        discussed here there are important advantages in using the meetings of this
                        Committee as the occasion for informal key country discussions. Among other
                        things this would permit the group to enjoy some degree of anonymity and its
                        consultations would not give rise to the undesirable speculation that would
                        inevitably arise if special international conferences were convened for the
                        purpose or a new consultative instrument was created. Moreover, if the type
                        of economic coordination suggested here was completely separated from the
                            <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> this would take away most of the
                        sinew and muscle required to make the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                        a meaningful organization which the United States wishes to do.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore proposed that arrangements be made to have this informal key
                        country group meet when appropriate at regular <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                            >OEEC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Economic Policy
                        Committee sessions to discuss previously prepared agenda. Regular meetings
                        of the Economic Policy Committee probably will be held with sufficient
                        frequency to ensure the necessary policy consultation and coordination in
                        the smaller group. However, if necessary, additional <gloss
                            target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> meetings could be convened on short
                        notice.</p>
                    <p>It is further suggested that the United States plan the first key country
                        consultations for the Economic Policy Committee meeting which I understand
                        is scheduled for early next year. The principal item <pb n="70"
                            xml:id="pg_70" facs="0102"/>on the agenda could be the development of
                        coordinated action to minimize short-term capital flows but other related
                        fiscal and monetary questions also might be covered.</p>
                    <p>I appreciate that the development of a United States position for such a
                        meeting would require coordination with other interested Government agencies
                        particularly Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank. In view of the attitudes
                        of the latter two agencies toward international economic policy coordination
                        it might be desirable to delay interagency discussions until the new
                        administration takes over. In the meantime I would suggest that the State
                        Department establish a working group to prepare its position.</p>

                    <p>The four Heads of Government at the Western Summit Meeting in Paris December
                        21, 1959 discussed the changes which had occurred in the international
                        economic situation and recommended that a meeting be held in Paris to
                        discuss new cooperative endeavors in the economic field.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, a Ministerial Meeting was held in Paris on January 14, 1960
                        where it was agreed that a group of four experts should be set up to study
                        the feasibility of revitalizing and broadening the work of the <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> through the establishment of a successor
                        organization which the United States and Canada could join as full members.
                        After lengthy consultation with representatives of the interested
                        governments and international organizations, the Group of Four sent its
                        report, “A Remodelled Economic Organization”, to the twenty governments in
                        April for their consideration.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter, intergovernmental negotiations on the reconstitution of the
                            <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> as the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                            >OECD</gloss> began in May and continued almost without break through
                        July. On July 22 a Ministerial Meeting was convened in Paris to review the
                        progress made in these negotiations. The Ministerial Meeting reached
                        agreement on the basic nature of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                        and on the general outline and most of the fundamental articles of the
                            <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Convention. It was also agreed to
                        establish a Preparatory Committee which would complete the negotiations on
                        the draft <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Convention, define the
                        structure of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>, and make
                        recommendations concerning <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> Acts and
                        activities to be carried over into the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                        >OECD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Preparatory Committee constituted by the Ministerial Resolution of July
                        23, 1960 held sessions from September 14 to November 23 during which time
                        the Committee completed its report (Tab C), the draft Convention (Tab B),
                        Protocols and Memorandum of Understanding (Tabs B–1, B–2, B–3, B–4, and
                        B–5), and determined which acts of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>
                        should be recommended to the Council of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                            >OECD</gloss> for approval (Tab C).</p>
                    <p>All of the documents prepared by the Preparatory Committee have been
                        forwarded to the governments for review prior to the Ministerial Conference

                    <p>While modifying and broadening the outlook of the Organization, it was
                        generally agreed that it would be wise to preserve many of the valuable
                        traditions and procedures of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> which
                        had worked so well for more than a decade. As a consequence, agreement was
                        reached on Article 5 of the Convention, which provides that, in order to
                        achieve its aim, the Organization may: <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0105"/>

                            <item>make recommendations to Members; and</item>
                            <label>c)</label>
                            <item>enter into agreements with Members, non-Member states, and
                                international organizations.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>It was furthermore agreed (Article 6) that unless the Organization agrees
                        unanimously for special cases, decision shall be taken and recommendations
                        shall be made by mutual agreement of all Members. Each member has one vote.
                        If a Member abstains from voting, a decision or recommendation shall only be
                        applicable to the other members—not to the abstaining member. In any case no
                        decision shall be binding on any Member until it has complied with its own
                        constitutional procedures.</p>
                    <p>The provisions of Article 6 thus make clear that no action binding on the
                        U.S. can be taken by the Organization without the concurrence of the United
                        States. Further, it is considered after the Convention enters into force,
                        that the United States representative will not have any additional powers
                        than now exist in the Executive to bind the United States, but any act of
                        the Organization outside the power of the Executive will require action by
                        Congress or the Senate as the case may be before the United States is
                        bound.</p>
                    <p>The United States considered it essential that there be no automatic
                        carry-over of <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> Acts into the <gloss
                            target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. Consequently, the U.S. urged the
                        following provision which appears in Article 15 of the draft Convention:
                        “... decisions, recommendations and resolutions of the Organization for
                        European Economic Cooperation shall require approval of the Council [of the
                            <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>]<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2"
                            >Ellipsis and brackets in the source text.</note> to be effective after
                        the coming into force of this Convention.” (Tab B–5). This means that no Act
                        of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> will be carried over into the
                            <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> unless the Council of the <gloss
                            target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> agrees unanimously. However, the European
                        countries considered that this provision might unsettle many of the
                        decisions heretofore made in the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and
                        it was accordingly agreed at the Ministers Meeting in June that an agreement
                        would be entered into which would commit the Members to approve the Acts
                        recommended for continuation by the Preparatory Committee but would allow
                        the United States and Canada a certain latitude with respect to such Acts.
                        This agreement is embodied in the Memorandum of Understanding on the
                        Application of Article 15 of the Convention (Tab B–5). Under this Memorandum
                        the United States and Canada may within ten days of their acceptance or
                        ratification of the Convention specify any Act or part thereof which it is
                        to be released from the commitment to approve. The Memorandum sets forth
                        certain procedures which may be followed for revision of the Preparatory
                        Committee recommendation as <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0106"/>to the
                        Act or part thereof. In any event, if the United States or Canada so wish
                        they have the privilege not to be bound by any Act or part thereof on which
                        they have notified, although such Act or part thereof may become binding on
                        the other members of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Article 14 of the Convention provides that after signature, the Convention
                        shall be ratified or accepted by the Signatories in accordance with their
                        respective constitutional requirements. The Convention enters into force
                        when all signatory countries have accepted or ratified, or on or after
                        September 30 if fifteen signatories have accepted or ratified. The
                        Department contemplates submitting the Convention and related documents to
                        the Senate for its advice and consent.</p>
                    <p>Article 17 provides that any party to the Convention can withdraw on twelve
                        months’ notice.</p>
                    <p>Attached to the Convention are four Protocols: (1) Supplementary Protocol No.
                        1 (Tab B–1) which provides for the representation in the <gloss
                            target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> of the European Economic Community, the
                        European Coal and Steel Community, and Euratom; (2) Supplementary Protocol
                        No. 2 (Tab B–2) which provides for the privileges, exemptions and immunities
                        of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>, its officials and
                        representatives to it; (3) Supplementary Protocol No. 3 (Tab B–3) which
                        establishes a Trade Committee and outlines its functions (the status of this
                        Protocol is still the subject of negotiation and the United States is
                        attempting to have it eliminated and its contents embodied in the report of
                        the Preparatory Committee); (4) Protocol on Revision of the Convention on
                        European Economic Cooperation of 16th April 1948 (Tab B–4) which provides
                        for the replacement of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> Convention
                        when the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Convention comes into force
                        (this Protocol will be signed only by the members of the <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and not by the United States or
                        Canada).</p>
                    <p>In addition to its recommendation on the Acts of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                            >OEEC</gloss> which should be continued, the Preparatory Committee has
                        made recommendations as to structure, activities and principles to be
                        followed by the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. In order to give some
                        assurance that these latter recommendations will be given due weight, a
                        Ministerial Resolution (Tab C–1) has been drafted which would “Approve the
                        report of the Preparatory Committee and Accept the recommendations contained
                        therein”. It is not considered that concurrence in this Resolution by the
                        United States and other countries would create a legal obligation, but would
                        merely “confirm the determination of Governments” to carry on the work in
                        accordance with recommendations (Preparatory Committee Report, Tab C, p.
                        15).</p>
                    <p>[Here follow recommendations that the Secretary (1) authorize signature of
                        the convention, protocols, and memorandum of understanding, (2) authorize

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> opened the three
                        hour meeting with a general presentation of United States views of world
                        economic problems, with special attention to the British concern over “world
                        illiquidity.” The Secretary emphasized the need for expanding economies, for
                        increasing world business activity. He said that real productive growth was
                        much more important than the level of reserves, or the position of sterling.
                        After the expansion of the previous years where such growth had been as high
                        as ten per cent on an annual basis, a “levelling-off” <pb n="77"
                            xml:id="pg_77" facs="0109"/>was to be expected. He said that in 1957 the
                        United Kingdom had followed wise monetary policies, that British action on
                        bank rate (5% to 7% on 9/19/57) was a sign of strength, a step in the right
                        direction. The Secretary said that press speculation over the pound’s future
                        was regrettable as it injured Britain’s position as a world banker and
                        endangered solvency. Within the limits possible in a parliamentary democracy
                        press articles harmful to financial stability should be curtailed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that irresponsible press handling of these financial
                        matters pointed up what to his mind was the crucial issue, a psychological
                        issue; this was the element of “confidence” which he called “the most
                        important single ingredient in the present economic situation,” the “great
                        intangible factor.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary called the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> “an unusual
                        device” to be sparingly used, else its effectiveness would be defeated. He
                        pointed out that the British had obtained $1.6 billion in 1957 from the
                            <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_EXIM1"
                            >EXIM</gloss> Bank, and deferral of U.S.-Canadian loan payments.
                        Britain’s problem now was how to increase its ability to earn. He
                        acknowledged some real improvement in 1957 in the U.K. situation, but added
                        that internal policies must be constantly directed toward improvement in the
                        internal U.K. economy. The world problem, which all countries faced, was how
                        to sustain adequate growth without inflation. The U.S. had faced this
                        problem for some years. In an uncertain world there could be no real hope
                        for certainty in what we did, no real expectation that economic problems
                        would lose their complexity.</p>
                    <p>Sir Leslie Rowan passed quickly over Secretary Anderson’s themes, agreeing
                        that confidence was an important element in any economic situation, that the
                        problem was maintenance of stability without disquieting inflation at the
                        same time sustaining a desired rate of growth.</p>
                    <p>Sir Leslie emphasized the role of reserves and liquidity. A shortage of
                        reserves would be a threat to future growth. Liberalization of trade on the
                        part of creditor countries was essential. Reserves must be adequate to
                        support normal functions of the economy. British reserves were too low,
                        entirely inadequate when one considered the borrowed sums repayable within
                        the next three years. There is, according to Sir Leslie, a three fold
                        “illiquidity”: a) gold; b) dollars; c) sterling. Wider use of the German
                            <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> was necessary. Sterling could no
                        longer meet the needs of other countries for short- and long-term
                        borrowings. The Sterling Area was “absolutely vital” and Sir Leslie said he
                        wanted to go on record by stating that there was “no intention whatever of
                        winding up the Sterling Area.”</p>
                    <p>Sir Leslie questioned the Secretary’s figure of 10 per cent in annual growth.
                        He felt the allowance for inflationary content would considerably lower the
                        figure. Even assuming a lesser percentage there <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78"
                            facs="0110"/>were insufficient reserves to support such growth. Gold was
                        insufficient, a dollar gap had begun again to appear, sterling balances
                        would decrease, perhaps as much as £300 million per year in the near future.
                        In the past eighteen months, reserves of the rest of the Sterling Area had
                        gone down by £500 million.</p>
                    <p>Sir Leslie referred to the previous day’s meeting where the U.S. side had
                        estimated a net outflow of gold and dollars from the U.S. of between one
                        half and three quarters of a billion dollars. Sir Leslie said this was just
                        about the amount net which the U.K. expected West Germany to take in and he
                        wondered how much good it would do simply to shift reserves from the largest
                        holder to the next largest holder. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said we did not contemplate so large a net increase
                        in Germany’s gold and dollar reserves.</p>
                    <p>Sir Leslie agreed there was no rigid trade-reserve formulas, but added that
                        when reserves were decreasing one had to question whether trade could
                        appreciably expand, especially when reserves were too low to meet any
                        abnormal fluctuations. Sir Robert Hall said it was all very well to talk of
                        earning reserves, but if there was a decreasing trend and trade imbalances
                        one asked where the reserves were which should be earned. The U.K., he said,
                        had some genuine intellectual and analytical doubts about world
                        liquidity.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> reiterated the U.S.
                        view that there were factors other than reserves and that he felt there was
                        undue pessimism on the U.S. balance of payments, that we would continue to
                        make heavy dollar purchases abroad.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> added a review of U.S.
                        trade policy, of attitudes toward such plans as that of Italian Foreign

                        economic aid. On the latter point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> agreed it could not be prevented, and that the U.S.
                        became concerned only when it went beyond safe limits.</p>
                    <p>In turning to the German reserve picture Sir Leslie said the Germans did not
                        consider that their reserves were too large. To Dr. Marget, <gloss
                            target="#t_FRB1">FRB</gloss>, who had said reserves were flowing out
                        from Germany, Sir Leslie sharply retorted that nothing else could be
                        expected after last year’s speculation in favor of the <gloss
                            target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> and that it was certain to be a temporary
                        phenomenon (<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> latest January figures confirm the
                        British analysis).</p>
                    <p>Dr. Marget said he felt there was no general shortage of reserves, that he
                        “candidly did not see any overall liquidity problem,” though there were of
                        course problems for individual countries, caused primarily by their own
                        unwise internal policies. He cited India as one of these “misbehaving”
                        nations. Sir Leslie differed with Dr. Marget, pointing out that the United
                        States, Canada, Germany and Venezuela had added $3.4 billion to their
                        reserves over the past 18 months while the rest of the world had lost $1.6
                        billion, despite drawings from the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. <pb
                            n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0111"/>He called this genuine
                        “maldistribution” of reserves. Marget reiterated his view with the statement
                        that “nothing adverse in the past was attributable to inadequacy of
                        reserves.” Sir Robert Hall said that obviously countries would have to be
                        separated out for analysis. He added that the future was important.
                        Admittedly the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> had provided a “masse de
                        manoeuvre” in December, 1956, but what would provide the “masse” if the
                            <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> could not provide it. Southard of
                        the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> said that while the <gloss
                            target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> was not “broke” there was a tendency for
                        all underdeveloped countries to spend for development all funds they could
                        put their hands on. Thailand and Venezuela were glaring exceptions to this
                        rule. There was little chance that spending and consumption patterns in
                        these other countries could change so that heavy demands from the
                        underdeveloped countries must be expected. Sir Robert Hall added that this
                        was a special problem for sterling; that the rest of the Sterling Area, for
                        example, was almost constantly in current and capital account deficit with
                        the non-sterling world, thus adding to strains on sterling.</p>
                    <p>The meeting concluded with an exchange of brief summaries of positions, with
                        the British expressing the hope that future meetings of such a nature might
                        be expected. There was no encouragement from the U.S. side.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comments:</hi> It is difficult to believe that the British
                        could have found any great measure of satisfaction in the meetings of
                        February 18–19. The meeting on the 19th seemed almost entirely negative with
                        the U.S. side finding little basis in the concern of the British over “world
                        illiquidity”. Perhaps this was an ill-chosen designation and a stronger
                        British case might have been made had the British dealt specifically with
                        the problems confronting sterling.</p>
                    <p>There seemed to be no enthusiasm on the U.S. side for future meetings and
                        initiative to hold further meetings is obviously left with the British, who
                        will doubtlessly want another meeting but who must now wait for developments
                        justifying another gathering since in my opinion we interpreted away the
                        basis of last week’s meeting which might have called forth future
                        meetings.</p>
                    <p>The general feeling on the U.S. side was that the British position was weak.
                        If so, it was probably partly deliberate as the British probably did not
                        want a rigid U.S. negative response to definite British proposals, and
                        wanted some flexibility. But something more than these meetings produced
                        must have been expected. It is difficult to find tangible results when one
                        side says it believes the other is too pessimistic and the latter can only
                        respond that it hopes the optimism of the former proves to be justified.
                        There was agreement only upon one point: a greater German financial
                        contribution is called for and is justified. On all other points there were
                        widely divergent interpretations: <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0112"/>a)
                        illiquidity and reserves; b) greater powers and resources for <gloss
                            target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>; c) trends toward further distortion of
                        trade and “maldistribution” of reserves.</p>
                    <p>There is no denying the seriousness of the British economic problems and an
                        imaginative approach to their solutions is called for. A startling reversal
                        of present economic trends in the U.S. will justify to some extent the U.S.
                        position in these recent meetings. It will not correct the long-run
                        difficulties of the United Kingdom. Any prolongation of the U.S. “recession”
                        would undoubtedly justify U.S.-U.K. meetings to deal with international
                        repercussions.</p>
                    <p>The possibility that the gold and dollar flow <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the
                        United States will about equal the gold and dollar flow <hi rend="italic"
                            >to</hi> Germany is likely to be realized. My own idea is that based on
                        the Germany trend to surplus in EPU which began in January thus reversing
                        its deficit trend of prior months, West Germany may gain $600-700 million
                        surplus in trade outside the U.S. with the deficit in trade with the United
                        States reducing this amount to a net of around $500 million. Here the
                        British, it seems to me, have pointed out a possible shift in reserves
                        benefiting only the Germans.</p>
                    <p>The British did not bring up two points: a) raising the price of gold; b)
                        changes in exchange rates. There was no suggestion of devaluation of the
                        pound.</p>

                        pressed for explanations and specifics. Franks’ proposals, he thought,

                        nor ours, and might sometimes involve tossing money away without much
                        effect. He thought it necessary look carefully at underlying financial
                        structure which supported world trade, to decide whether billions spent to
                        cope with crisis situations might be used more effectively to repair and
                        strengthen that underlying financial structure. He greatly impressed with
                        work which had been performed by <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and
                        International Bank, thought attention should perhaps be focused on schemes

                        Commonwealth—they did not want to do so, and would not be politically
                        possible if they wanted to. There had to be working appraisal of kind of
                        economic relations which were to exist between Commonwealth, American and
                        Europe. They hope have European FTA and kind of commercial policy on both
                        sides which would bring sterling and dollar worlds closer together, but
                        there was danger these things could not be achieved, particularly if there

                                <item>The evidences of strain are to be found among the
                                    underdeveloped countries. Of 40 representative countries in this
                                    group, 23 suffered losses of reserves in 1957. Moreover,
                                    relatively few underdeveloped countries have foreign exchange
                                    reserves large enough to provide any substantial cushion against
                                    declines in export earnings. Taking reserves as a per cent of
                                    annual imports as a measure, only 13 underdeveloped countries
                                    out of a group of 40 had reserves in excess of 50 per cent.
                                    These were Australia, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq,
                                    Ireland, Pakistan, Taiwan (China), Thailand, Uruguay, Venezuela
                                    and Viet-Nam. Moreover, it will be seen that two of these
                                    countries, Taiwan and Viet-Nam, receive very large aid from the
                                    United States. Two others, Uruguay and Egypt, have substantial
                                    gold reserves which they would find extremely difficult
                                    politically to use to any appreciable extent. Ten other
                                    countries on the list have reserves ranging between 30 and 50
                                    per cent of annual imports. These are Burma, Ceylon, Dominican
                                    Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, Lebanon,
                                    Mexico and Syria. It is interesting to note that Mexico is on
                                    this list. Although Mexican reserves at the end of 1957 amounted
                                    to $431 million, they amounted to only 37 per cent of Mexico’s
                                    imports in that year, and thus were equal to only four months’
                                    imports. The remaining 17 countries on the list at the end of
                                    1957 had reserves amounting to less than 30 per cent of annual
                                    imports. In fact 11 of them had <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84"

                                    following situation. The Fund at the end of March 1958 had

                                    marks. The industrial and developed countries had <hi

                                    comprising the gold tranche, first credit tranche and second
                                    credit tranche amounting to $1,195 million, and the United
                                    Kingdom had a stand-by comprising the third credit tranche
                                    amounting to $325 million. The total of these availabilities is
                                    $1,520 million, which amounts to 3.6 per cent of the annual
                                    imports of those countries. As to the underdeveloped countries,
                                    those with quotas in excess of $75 million had unused portions
                                    of their quotas in the same tranches amounting to $495 million.
                                    The underdeveloped countries had unused quotas in those tranches
                                    amounting to $298 million, stand-by arrangements within the
                                    third credit tranche of $33 million and other third credit
                                    tranche facilities amounting to $139 million. The total of these
                                    amounts potentially available to underdeveloped countries is
                                    $965 million, or 4.6 per cent of their annual imports. The grand
                                    total of these amounts available to the industrial and
                                    underdeveloped countries which are members of the Fund is $2,485
                                    million, which is $100 million less than the Fund total of gold
                                    and convertible or near-convertible currencies as shown at the

                                <item>A second table has been attached which shows resources
                                    available to member countries which are in difficulty. The list
                                    is necessarily selective but it serves to show that, looked at
                                    from this point of view, Fund resources are relatively small.
                                    The 25 underdeveloped countries in the table have remaining only
                                    $103.1 million in the gold tranche and first credit tranche—that
                                    is, the portion of their quotas which may be drawn readily. They
                                    have $296.8 million in the second credit tranche which, under
                                    present Fund policies, they may expect to draw provided they are
                                    taking corrective measures which seem likely to be effective in
                                    dealing with imbalance. For some of these countries, such as
                                    Indonesia, this test may be very difficult to meet under present
                                    conditions. In any event, even assuming that the test can be
                                    met, the two amounts combined would provide assistance of about
                                    $400 million, which is less than 4 per cent of the annual
                                    imports of these countries. To this may be added another $66
                                    million comprising the third credit tranche in the case of
                                    countries with very small quotas and <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85"

                                    substantially the same terms of the second credit tranche.
                                    Countries with larger quotas have no such expectations since, as
                                    the first table shows, the funds would not be available to meet

                                <item>A good practical case could be made out for an increase in
                                    Fund resources, from the U.S. point of view. An increase in Fund
                                    quotas is the only available way in which a U.S. contribution
                                    for balance of payments assistance would be substantially
                                    matched by contributions from other countries. For example, if
                                    the United States were to agree to an increase in its quota of
                                    $1 billion (present quota $2.7 billion), the prospects would be
                                    for total quota increase of about $3.5 billion. Of the $2.5
                                    billion increase in quotas of other countries 25 per cent would
                                    be in gold, or $625 million. The U.S. increase would also be 25
                                    per cent in gold. Hence the Fund would receive $875 million in
                                    gold and $750 million in U.S. notes, or slightly more than $1.6
                                    billion in gold and U.S. dollars. In addition, the Fund would
                                    receive increased amounts of deutsche marks and Canadian dollars
                                    which would bring the total new availabilities up to around $2
                                    billion, or double the U.S. contribution. Moreover, it should be
                                    kept in mind that repayments to the Fund in U.S. dollars
                                    automatically return to the U.S. Treasury until needed again by
                                    the Fund.</item>

                                <item>The question is whether the Congress would be willing to agree
                                    to an increase in the U.S. quota in the Fund. This seems most
                                    doubtful under present circumstances. Very strong arguments by
                                    the Secretary of the Treasury and other high U.S. officials
                                    would be necessary to win Congressional support, including
                                    presentation of evidence that the world foreign exchange
                                    situation was in danger unless added support could be provided.
                                    At the present time this line of argument could readily lead to
                                    pessimistic speculation in foreign exchange markets.</item>

                                <item>The conclusion to be drawn from the above line of reasoning is
                                    that an increase in the U.S. quota in the Fund is not feasible
                                    at this time. However, in forthcoming talks with the United
                                    Kingdom the U.S. officials might say that they were aware that
                                    Fund resources were inadequate, that it is not feasible for the
                                    United States to submit a request to Congress for an increase in
                                    U.S. quota at this time, but that the United States will watch
                                    developments and keep the prospects for a quota increase under
                                    review.</item>

                        suggested position for the United States to take on the resources of the
                        Fund and the Bank.<note n="1" xml:id="d35fn1"><ref target="#d155">Document
                                155</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CTB1"
                            >Coughran</persName> observed that a 100 percent increase in the United
                        States subscription to the International Bank would amount to $3,175
                        million, but it was contemplated that none of this increase would be called
                        unless defaults occurred on the Bank’s loans. The increase would appear in
                        the U.S. Budget as new obligational authority but would have no cash
                        impact.</p>
                    <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0119"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFAJ1">Southard</persName> reviewed the proposal
                        for an increase in the Fund’s resources, pointing out that the distinction
                        between a 50 percent increase in the Fund and a 100 percent increase in the
                        Bank was a practical one. In the case of the Fund, 25 percent of the
                        increase would have to be paid immediately in gold, and there was no
                        assurance that the non-interest-bearing notes given by the United States for
                        the balance of its increase would not be cashed. He noted the suggestion
                        that the United States might wish to have a larger quota in order to
                        preserve its voting power, if other countries with large quotas desired
                        increases of more than 50 percent. However, he thought the requirement of a
                        25 percent gold payment would limit the eagerness of other countries for
                        quota increases in excess of 50 percent. He felt that a 50 percent increase
                        in quotas would adequately meet the needs of the Fund.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFAJ1">Southard</persName> discussed the special
                        problems that might arise in the case of China and India. If the German
                        quota were increased by 50 percent, China could waive its right to a quota
                        increase, and still retain its position among the first five countries. If
                        the German increase in quota were substantially larger than 50 percent,
                        however, China would drop out of the first five. The Chinese Director was
                        aware of the practical difficulties involved, such as putting up 25 percent
                        of the increase in gold, and intended to discuss the matter with his
                        government.</p>
                    <p>On procedure, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFAJ1">Southard</persName> indicated
                        that the resolutions on the increases might be included by the Joint
                        Procedures Committee in its reports, which would probably be approved
                        without discussion. Alternatively, if a discussion of the resolutions were
                        desired, the Joint Procedures Committee might recommend that they be
                        considered at the sessions on the Annual Reports of the Fund and Bank,
                        respectively.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said that he was in
                        agreement with the recommended action on the increases provided it did not
                        imply that basic decisions had been taken on all of the issues raised by
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Document No. 2361. He wished to
                        discuss with the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank some of the
                        problems, such as those relating to the International Bank’s budget and to
                        the increased use of contributions from other countries. He favored an
                        increase in the International Bank’s capital, but questioned whether calling
                        the International Bank a $10 billion or a $20 billion institution gave a
                        correct picture, in view of the large amount of capital not called. He
                        considered an increase in Fund quotas to be necessary, and approved the
                        requirement for a 25 percent gold payment. He noted that in some instances
                        demands made on the Export-Import Bank were ones that properly should be
                        made on the International Monetary Fund.</p>

                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SMS1">Szymczak</persName>, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1"
                            >Mann</persName> all indicated approval of the recommended Action. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> observed that the proposal
                        with respect to the International Bank would involve a request for $3.2
                        billion of new obligational authority, for an account which already carried
                        an unobligated balance of $2.5 billion from the 1946 subscription. With
                        respect to the International Monetary Fund any increase in the U.S. quota
                        would involve both new obligational authority and an expenditure. The
                        proposed increases in Fund and Bank resources, added to requirements of the
                        Mutual Security Program and PL 480, would result in a request to Congress
                        for new obligational authority of from $10 billion to $12 billion next year
                        for foreign programs. He thought this might affect the Mutual Security
                        Program. He questioned whether the extra cost of a 100 percent quota
                        increase in the Fund in order to preserve our relative voting power would be
                        justified. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFAJ1">Southard</persName> thought that
                        a small increase, possibly 60 to 65 percent, would be enough to preserve the
                        United States position.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said the consensus appeared to favor the recommended action, and
                        that it would be considered adopted, but that a further meeting would be
                        held to discuss details if desired by the Export-Import Bank.</p>

                        <item>The authors of the report found that the problem of excess local
                            currencies accumulated by the U.S. abroad is presently confined to a few
                            countries and is a direct result of P.L. 480. They believe, however,
                            that there may be a serious problem in the future if the P.L. 480 loan
                            program continues at the present or an accelerated rate and the
                            Development Loan Fund loans are repaid in local currencies.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>They recommend that the future accumulation of local currencies be
                            reduced by amending P.L. 480 to permit grants as well as loans. They
                            would also reduce interest rates on loans and eliminate maintenance of
                            value, where no useful purpose would be served by increasing U.S.
                            holdings of local currency. They would provide a greater incentive for
                            repayment of loans in dollars.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>They oppose use of local currencies for U.S. purchases of exportable
                            goods and services from the underdeveloped countries as this would
                            deprive those countries of resources and foreign exchange earnings. They
                            would make exceptions where such purchases were used to develop new
                            markets.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>They have many suggestions for using local currencies: they would make
                            grants to educational foundations and create new foundations for
                            educational and scientific research; establish industrial development
                            banks; help countries hire technical personnel; purchase of non-voting
                            stock of the International Finance Corporation to be held by the
                            countries whose currencies are invested.</item>

                                amended and extended P.L. 480 (the Agricultural Trade Development

                            result in increased exports to the U.S. on the grounds that foreign
                            countries should not be restrained from encouraging dollar-earning
                            projects. They would also not insist that 25 percent of P.L. 480 funds
                            uniformly be reserved for loans to private investors.</item>

                        Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the
                        International Finance Corporation were held in New Delhi, October 6–10,
                        1958. Secretary of the Treasury <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Robert B.
                            Anderson</persName>, U.S. Governor of the three institutions, led the
                        U.S. delegation. U.S. proposals calling for study of measures to increase
                        the resources of the Bank and the Fund were adopted by both Boards of
                        Governors and referred to their executive boards.</p>
                    <p>In a statement released at New Delhi on October 7, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> reaffirmed the U.S. position that
                        the price of gold in U.S. dollars should remain unchanged. This statement
                        reads in part as follows: “The assured interchangeability of gold and
                        dollars at $35 per ounce for the settlement of international accounts is a
                        basic element of strength in the international financial structure.” He also
                        noted that he believed “that attention should be focused upon the adequacy
                        of resources to meet temporary imbalances of individual countries, rather
                        than upon the subject of the price of gold.”</p>

                        various aspects of our gold situation. The immediate problem is that our
                        gold outflow so far this year has reached a record total of $2.1 billion and
                        could very well continue for some time at an average monthly rate of around
                        $150 million. It seems very likely that the Secretary will be subjected to
                        Congressional questioning on this subject during the next session of the
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>Although it is difficult to reach any clear conclusion about the extent to
                        which our recent gold outflow may have been caused by active speculation
                        against the dollar, there can be no doubt that this outflow has created the
                        kind of situation in which troublesome speculation could very easily mount.
                        Congressional questioning of the Secretary in such a situation could
                        stimulate still further speculation.</p>
                    <p>Although the long range and medium range prospects of this problem are such
                        that the Treasury must seriously consider all its implications and the
                        various alternative courses of action, it would appear that the gold drain
                        at this moment and for the immediate future is not such that immediate
                        direct actions by the Treasury are required.</p>

                    <p>Two possible courses of action in this situation are as follows: <list>

                                    fiscal year 1960 budget which, when known to the public, would
                                    have the effect of allaying public speculation, here and abroad,
                                    about our overall economic situation. If public anticipations
                                    are sufficiently affected by such action, as announced in the
                                    President’s Budget Message and elsewhere, that part of the U.S.
                                    gold outflow attributable to active speculation by foreigners

                                    fiscal year 1960 budget has had an effect on reducing the U.S.
                                    gold outflow by the time Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                                        >Anderson</persName> is called upon to testify, he may want
                                    to take the line that the outflow is a warning signal, provided
                                    by the operation of our gold bullion standard; that we must be
                                    on guard against inflationary developments in the U.S.; that for
                                    us to interfere with the outflow would deprive us of this useful
                                    warning signal; and that we, therefore, expect to address
                                    ourselves to means of averting inflation in the full expectation
                                    that success in this effort will be attended by a reduction in
                                    our gold outflow. The danger in such an approach is that
                                    foreigners may discount as relatively ineffective our attempts
                                    to control the gold outflow by a tighter domestic fiscal policy
                                    and, as a result, may be all the more tempted to withdraw gold
                                    from the U.S.</p></item>

                            <item>An additional possible course of Treasury action would go a step
                                beyond that outlined in (1) above and also somewhat beyond our
                                previous tactics on the subject. This step would be for the
                                Secretary to find some way of making it clear to Congress—and
                                through Congress to the public, here and abroad—that if the Treasury
                                should at some future date feel called upon to deal directly with a
                                gold outflow through changes in our gold policy, the one thing the
                                Treasury would not contemplate with respect to its gold policy is
                                any increase in its dollar price of gold or any action which would
                                ultimately lead to that result. Even though logically this statement
                                should allay speculation that an embargo on gold transactions is in
                                the offing it may by itself not do so. To avert such possible
                                speculation and the gold drain which would be caused by it, it would
                                be essential for the Secretary to make the main theme of his
                                testimony the point that we are not at present or in the near future
                                confronted with a problem arising out of the gold drain requiring
                                any action in the field of gold policy.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Under either of the above courses of action the Secretary is very likely to
                        be asked by Congress at what point would he contemplate taking direct action
                        to stop a continued gold outflow. We would assume that the Secretary would
                        wish to handle such a question by indicating that there are no a priori
                        guides for such action because any such decision must take into account not
                        only the rate of gold outflow, the size of our gold stock, and the amount of
                        dollar balances held by foreigners, but also the U.S. price situation and
                        the general climate of financial opinion and anticipations here and abroad
                        at the time. In this connection the Secretary might wish to point out that
                        there are a number of motives, other than active speculation, which can lead
                        foreign countries to buy gold from the U.S. and that losses of gold due to
                        such motives might be viewed in quite a different light from losses <pb

                        the question of an increase in quotas. The principal problems on which

                            countries will pay 25 per cent of the quota increase. What is in dispute
                            is how to assist countries which want some form of easement of this
                            burden. Two methods are being considered: <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94"

                                    agreed that only those countries should be included in the 75
                                    per cent participation calculation which pay 20 per cent of the
                                    total gold at once and agree to pay the remainder in, say, four

                                        question</hi> is whether to allow countries broader latitude
                                    (e.g., no down payment and no fixed schedule) provided they are
                                    not included in the 75 per cent. I advise against this at this
                                    stage.</item>

                                    should be prepared to consider drawings by “needy” countries to
                                    offset the gold payment. The undecided question is what sort of
                                    repurchase schedule should be required. Specifically, should any
                                    such drawing be limited to 80 per cent of the gold payment; and
                                    how promptly should the drawing be repurchased? The Indian
                                    Director is strongly objecting to the 80 per cent limit, and is
                                    insisting on repurchase in the third, fourth and fifth years
                                    after drawing. I have argued for repurchase in three years, and
                                    would be willing to give up the 80 per cent limit in
                                    return.</item>

                                        repurchase schedule for special drawings and as to the
                                        importance it attached to a quota increase beyond 50 percent
                                        for Germany and possibly other countries. On the first
                                        point, the Council favored “endeavoring to hold the
                                        repayment period to three years, with a possible compromise,
                                        if necessary, of a maximum of two one-year extensions.” On
                                        the second point, the “consensus was that it was important
                                        to have a large increase in the German quota, but that it
                                        should be linked to reasonable increases in the quotas of a

                        November 25, 1958<note n="1" xml:id="d40fn1">The letter from insurance
                            executive and former Ambassador to the United Kingdom Lewis W. Douglas,
                            dated November 25, is not printed. (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Ibid</hi>.)</note></p>
                    <p>The main thesis of the letter is that the United States has had a persistent
                        trade surplus with the rest of the world and since “we are an extremely
                        protectionist nation”, it is desirable for the United States regularly to
                        pay more dollars to foreign countries so as to enable them to cover current
                        transactions and service on debts without impairing exchange stability. It
                        suggests the possibility of creating an institution “to export dollars on
                        public account” for foreign aid and the economic development of the
                        less-developed countries. This institution would receive permanent
                        appropriations from Congress and would distribute the aid without the
                        necessity of annual review.</p>
                    <p>The argument of a chronic dollar shortage must be considered in the light of
                        facts in recent years. Since 1950, U.S. Government grants and capital
                        investments abroad, plus private investment, have provided more dollars than
                        were needed by foreign countries to cover their deficits with the United
                        States on goods and service account. (See table attached.)<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d40fn2">Not printed.</note> In this period foreign countries as
                        a group have consistently gained in their holdings of gold and dollars. In
                        fact, since the beginning of 1950 the gold and liquid dollar resources of
                        foreign <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0128"/>countries have more than
                        doubled, from $15.5 billion to $31.5 billion, and in addition there has been
                        substantial foreign investment in the United States private sector.</p>
                    <p>The countries of Europe in particular have in the last nine years nearly all
                        emerged with strong balance-of-payments situations, and have increased their
                        gold and dollar reserves. They have not merely been able to finance their
                        own import requirements, but are now also in a position to finance increased
                        exports to less-developed areas and to contribute increasingly toward
                        economic development in such areas. There are individual exceptions, such as
                        France, whose situation continues unsatisfactory. Also the United Kingdom,
                        among others, temporarily encountered serious balance-of-payments
                        difficulties during the Suez crisis.</p>
                    <p>The less-developed areas of the world are, of course, in a different
                        situation. These poor and financially weak countries have import demands in
                        excess of their foreign exchange earnings. Programs of economic development
                        require capital imports, and, in addition, many of these countries have had
                        inflationary difficulties which have added to their current
                        balance-of-payments problems.</p>
                    <p>The balance-of-payments difficulties of these less-developed countries and of
                        individual developed countries like France, however, are not essentially a
                        dollar problem. These difficulties reflect a general inadequacy of foreign
                        exchange earnings not merely of United States dollars, and the whole problem
                        of economic development is a broader and wholly different question from that
                        envisaged in earlier discussions of the so-called “dollar gap”.</p>
                    <p>Programs of military aid, economic aid, and assistance for economic
                        development must be considered on their own merits in terms of the political
                        and economic objectives sought. The form of these programs and the amounts
                        of funds provided for them must be adapted to these objectives and not
                        generally to distribute dollars abroad as a means of financing a
                        non-existent “dollar shortage”.</p>
                    <p>The balance-of-payments problems of the less-developed countries have usually
                        little direct relation to United States commercial policy, though there are
                        exceptions such as the countries exporting lead and zinc. Many of the
                        exports of the less-developed areas are either duty free or subject to
                        relatively low tariffs. In addition, the industrialized countries of Europe
                        have in recent years become increasingly important, relatively to the United
                        States, as a factor in world demand for the commodities exported by
                        less-developed countries. It also should be noted that the U.S. Government
                        has for a period of 20 years been engaged in a program of reducing trade
                        barriers through trade agreements, <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>,
                        and other measures, and the level of duties is a fraction of what they were
                        years ago.</p>

                    <p>The proposal to establish an institution with permanent appropriations to
                        provide dollar assistance without the necessity of annual Congressional
                        review raises serious questions which must be adequately considered. While
                        the annual review procedure may involve some difficulties in planning
                        programs of economic development, it may be argued, on the other hand, that
                        since expenditures for economic assistance programs are so large and the
                        character of these programs is changed from time to time, Congressional
                        review is essential not only to protect the public purse but to maintain
                        popular control over an important area of government activity. This problem
                        is now being given serious attention in the Administration.</p>

                    <p>I thought you might like to have a handy memorandum that would try to state
                        briefly and simply the nature and significance of the formal moves to
                        nonresident convertibility by the European countries which were announced
                        over the past week-end and which became effective on December 29, 1958. To
                        that end, I am sending you this brief memorandum.</p>

                        <item>Since the war the European countries, including the United Kingdom,
                            have had exchange controls which put limits on the freedom of both
                            residents and nonresidents to convert their currencies into other
                            currencies, especially the U.S. dollar. These countries have also had
                            quota restrictions on imports and ordinarily these restrictions have
                            been more severe in the case of imports from the dollar area which means
                            chiefly the United States and Canada.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Much progress has been made in the last few years in relaxing the
                            restrictions on the convertibility of the European currencies into
                            dollars. So far as <hi rend="italic">nonresident</hi> holders of those
                            currencies are concerned, the final step has now been taken. Hereafter
                            nonresidents will be able freely to convert their holdings of European
                            currencies into any other currency including dollars, unless the
                            holdings arose out of a capital transaction.</item>

                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The most important change is in connection with the pound sterling.
                            Heretofore, nonresident holders of the pound sterling, that is, persons
                            outside the sterling area, had to have official permission in order to
                            convert the sterling into dollars at the official rate. Lacking that
                            permission, they could convert the sterling (which was called
                            transferable sterling) into dollars in free exchange markets such as New
                            York or Zurich. But they could do so only at a discount, and this
                            discount in the last year has generally been about 1½ per cent. Under
                            the new regulations, these conversions into dollars can take place
                            without official approval, and can be handled by banks in the United
                            Kingdom and at the official dollar rate for sterling.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>This move to nonresident convertibility is an important step toward
                            full convertibility of the leading European currencies, especially
                            sterling, the German mark, the Belgian and French francs, the Italian
                            lira, and the Dutch guilder. From the special standpoint of the United
                            States, it means that people who want to buy American goods will no
                            longer have to pay a higher price for dollar exchange than they would if
                            they were buying goods which could be paid for with sterling or some
                            European currency.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>The important remaining step to be taken by these European countries
                            before they will have established full convertibility for their
                            currencies is to eliminate import restrictions which are based on
                            balance-of-payments considerations. Some of them, especially the
                            Netherlands, and Belgium, have already virtually completed this task.
                            But others, especially the United Kingdom and France, still have fairly
                            severe import quota restrictions and even prohibitions. These aim at
                            preventing the residents of those countries from importing as much from
                            abroad as they would like to. Moreover, these restrictions are more
                            severe in the case of imports from the United States and other countries
                            of the dollar area than in the case of imports from other parts of the
                            world. Also, the residents of these countries are not allowed to have
                            all the foreign currency they want in order to travel abroad or to make
                            remittances to people in foreign countries in foreign currencies.
                            However, there are very encouraging signs that the United Kingdom in
                            particular and the other European countries intend to make real progress
                            in the next year further to reduce the discriminatory restrictions
                            against imports from the dollar area and also to reduce still further
                            their total restrictions on imports for balance-of-payments reasons. If
                            they can do this without having severe strains on their foreign exchange
                            reserves, they will have reached the point where they can safely make
                            their currencies fully convertible for residents as well as for
                            nonresidents.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>There were two other events which were related to the move to
                            nonresident convertibility: (a) France established a new par value which
                            devalued the franc by about 17 per cent, to 493 per dollar. <pb n="99"
                                xml:id="pg_99" facs="0131"/>France has made good progress toward
                            stability in the 12 months since the United States, the Fund, and the

                            program. The new action is intended to be the capstone of the whole
                            effort and to equip France to relax restrictions on trade and to compete
                            in the Common Market which begins its first year on January 1. (b) The
                            European Payments Union went out of existence on December 29 and was
                            replaced by the European Monetary Agreement. This Agreement provides for
                            a European Fund with $600 million in resources, partly from the capital
                            of the EPU to which the United States contributed, and partly from new
                            contributions by the European members. This Fund will make short-term
                            loans to the members.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>In general, the new move to nonresident convertibility, together with
                            the prospect for further reductions in restrictions imposed on residents
                            of European countries who wish to buy goods or services from abroad, has
                            provided the best promise of the achievement of full convertibility of
                            leading currencies which has existed since the end of the war.</item>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName>Chairman</persName></hi>: In order to
                        promote the most effective use of local currencies owned by the United
                        States, and in order to expedite and improve the P.L. 480 program for the
                        disposal of agricultural surpluses, the Department of State proposes that
                        the United States eliminate its “maintenance-of-value” requirement whereby
                        foreign borrowers of United States-owned local currencies must repay to the
                        United States any additional amounts which may be necessary to reflect the
                        dollar equivalent of the local currency at the time of lending.</p>
                    <p>This proposal is consistent with the recommendations of two recent expert
                        reports on the subject—the report of Dr. John H. Davis on <pb n="100"
                            xml:id="pg_100" facs="0132"/>P.L. 480,<note n="1" xml:id="d42fn1">Not
                            further identified.</note> and the Special Report on the Accumulation
                        and Administration of Local Currencies submitted to the International
                        Cooperation Administration by Messrs. Berenson, Bristol, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_SRI1">Straus</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d36">Document 36</ref> and <ref target="#d42fn1">footnote
                                1</ref> thereto.</note></p>
                    <p>At the present time local currencies accruing to the United States as a
                        result of P.L. 480 sales are almost the sole source of local currencies
                        available for foreign lending. In the future, however, this source will be
                        broadened by inclusion of local currency repayments, not only of P.L. 480
                        loans themselves, but also of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans. The problems created by the
                        maintenance-of-value clause are, therefore, likely to increase.</p>
                    <p>The maintenance-of-value provision has in many cases caused considerable
                        difficulty in negotiating loan agreements under P.L. 480. Foreign
                        governments are understandably reluctant to conclude loan agreements
                        requiring maintenance-of-value on local currency loans from the United
                        States when they have an alternative choice of borrowing from their own
                        banking system without the maintenance-of-value requirement and of allowing
                        equivalent amounts of P.L. 480 funds to remain idle.</p>
                    <p>It is now the policy of the United States to require that substantial
                        agreement be reached on the terms of P.L. 480 loan agreements at the same
                        time as P.L. 480 sales agreements are concluded. This practice is desirable
                        as a general rule. However, if we continue to insist upon the inclusion of
                        maintenance-of-value, as well as upon a simultaneous understanding on the
                        loan and sales agreements, we may expect that negotiating difficulties will
                        increase, will slow down the surplus disposal program, and may reduce its
                        over-all magnitude.</p>
                    <p>The negotiating problems now experienced in connection with making local
                        currency loans effective are formidable. Idle local currency funds are
                        accumulating in a number of countries and this is proving to be a serious
                        obstacle in making use of the funds to promote economic development, which
                        is an important objective of the Agricultural Trade Development and
                        Assistance Act. We believe that the maintenance-of-value requirement is a
                        major inhibiting factor in effectively promoting this objective.</p>
                    <p>The benefits to the United States originally anticipated from the
                        maintenance-of-value clause are largely illusory. The clause has meaning, of
                        course, only for currencies which have been overvalued and for which
                        devaluation has occurred or is in prospect. In such cases, however, the
                        United States is often favorable to devaluation and would not want the
                        maintenance-of-value clause to stand as an obstacle to sound currency
                        reform. Also, we may expect that if there has been a devaluation the country
                        concerned will press vigorously for renegotiation to <pb n="101"
                            xml:id="pg_101" facs="0133"/>eliminate the effect of the
                        maintenance-of-value clause. Consequently the clause is a potential source
                        of trouble in our relations with other friendly governments.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that the elimination of maintenance-of-value in respect of
                        loan repayments would in no way affect the amount of local currency
                        presently received by the United States in return for the sale of P.L. 480
                        agricultural products since such receipts are not now subject to
                        maintenance-of-value. It should be noted, also, that the elimination of
                        maintenance-of-value would still entitle the United States to receive in
                        repayment for local currency loans the same amount of local currency it
                        would have held if the loan had not been made, plus, of course,
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing, it is requested that the National Advisory Council
                        take early favorable action on the proposal of the Department of State,
                        which is concurred in by the Department of Agriculture, to eliminate the
                        maintenance-of-value requirement from all United States loans of local
                        currency.</p>

                        “Has the U.S. been pricing itself out of our export markets” seems
                        reassuring and accords with appraisals I have seen from other sources. The
                        gold flow for the time <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0134"/>being also
                        seems to have leveled off, and this may be viewed as a very tentative and
                        partial confirmation of the Commerce Department’s analysis.</p>
                    <p>For the long run, however, we continue to face the fact that even without a
                        deterioration of our export position, our balance of payments is likely to
                        continue in deficit. It has been in deficit almost uninterruptedly for
                        nearly 10 years. Our real problem, as I see it, therefore, is not any
                        immediate threat to our gold reserves. The threat is the persistent build up
                        of short-term liabilities against an unchanging gold reserve.</p>
                    <p>This increase in the world’s holdings of U.S. dollars is not really necessary
                        to finance a normal expansion of world trade over the foreseeable future,
                        according to the (rather optimistic) estimates of the International Monetary
                        Fund. The international liquidity needs of the world would be met, according
                        to the Fund, from new gold production alone. But the fact that the world may
                        not need additional dollar balances does not imply that something will
                        automatically happen to end our balance of payments deficit.</p>
                    <p>For the very long run, this raises the question whether a world currency
                        system based upon growing world dollar holdings, which in turn are based
                        upon a static U.S. gold reserve, should not be buttressed by some other
                        elements, such as a greatly strengthened <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                        >IMF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>More immediately, the question is whether we should not try to get such gold
                        reserves as we have into a more maneuverable position. At present, $12.0
                        billion of our $20.6 billion holdings are tied up in Federal Reserve
                        requirements. Since we do not practice domestic convertibility of currency
                        into gold, these reserves perform no immediate function. They do perform
                        another function: that of bringing pressure on us to pursue conservative
                        financial policies, in order to avoid a shortage of reserves. This pressure
                        is beginning to be felt now, but it is likely to lead to many undesirable
                        side effects: cuts in foreign aid, more protectionism, less stimulation of
                        foreign investment. The traditional gold standard mechanism, therefore, is
                        apt to produce very painful repercussions today.</p>
                    <p>It would seem wiser not to bank on this mechanism, and instead to use our
                        reserves as effectively as we can. That would mean getting rid of the 25
                        percent gold reserve requirement of the Federal Reserve. We would then have
                        over $20 billion to meet our $17.6 billion foreign liabilities. The talk
                        about the weakness of the dollar probably would come to a quick end.</p>
                    <p>Such a step should not be taken at a time when the dollar was under pressure.
                        That would look like panic. But any prolonged levelling off of the gold flow
                        would present an opportunity. Of course, the <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103"
                            facs="0135"/>interest in taking action also diminishes at such a time.
                        The next few months may present an opportunity and I think it would be
                        worthwhile to study the pros and cons.</p>

                            Gold.</note> After some $12 billion worth of gold is set aside for the
                        25% reserve required to back our currency, approximately $81/2 billion
                        remains for meeting foreign claims which actually exceed this amount
                        considerably. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> was not
                        disturbed by this, however, for there is no reason for all of these claims
                        to be presented simultaneously so long as confidence exists in the solidity
                        of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> dollar.</p>
                    <p>With regard to recent trends of heavier conversions of dollars into gold, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> pointed out that foreign
                        nations are maintaining their established levels of American dollar holdings
                        and that the conversions represent their excess earnings of dollars in any
                        given year.</p>
                    <p>Regarding agitation for raising the price of gold, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> explained that advocates of this
                        have varying reasons—to make gold mining more profitable, or to provide
                        indirectly (and probably unsuccessfully) a bar to excessive Congressional
                        spending, or merely to provide a windfall to those who hold gold. Raising
                        the price of gold, <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0136"/>however, would
                        be a boon to the Russians, would reduce the value of some $20 billion of our
                        currency with only a very insignificant increase in the value of Government
                        gold holdings, and seriously shake the world’s confidence in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> dollar.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> warned repeatedly against
                        even the slightest hint that the subject might ever be taken under
                        consideration, for this would be sufficient to shake confidence and start a
                        run on our gold holdings. He asked members of the Cabinet to be overly
                        sensitive to this matter because questions on it keep cropping up in strange
                        places.</p>
                    <p>Related to this whole question was the matter of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> fiscal management policies which foreign governments watch
                        closely to judge the strength of our dollar.</p>
                    <p>There was brief discussion of the mechanics of minting gold under the mark of
                        various countries and of international transfers accomplished in New York
                        banks.</p>
                    <p>The President recalled the attention he had given to this matter during the
                        1952 campaign and shortly thereafter prior to putting the question
                        aside.</p>

                    <p>The Council considered the proposal of the Department of State, in which the
                        Department of Agriculture concurred, to eliminate the maintenance-of-value

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that the paper
                        referred to the difficulties of negotiating PL 480 loan agreements with the
                        maintenance-of-value requirement. He said that there was an additional
                        problem not mentioned in the paper, in that a number of countries had signed
                        PL 480 loan agreements but had not drawn on the loans. The whole problem was
                        measured by the amount of unused local currencies in the possession of the
                        United States. He recalled the problems that had arisen with Turkey, which
                        for a long period had not signed PL 480 loan agreements. The United States
                        had finally transferred a substantial portion of these PL 480 funds to a
                        grant category. In response to an inquiry from the Chairman, Mr.
                            <persName>Myers</persName> said that he had nothing to add to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s statement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kearns</persName> supported removal of the
                        maintenance-of-value requirement and said that the policy should apply
                        equally to private and government borrowers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said it would apply to all loans of local currency.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> recalled that there was no
                        maintenance-of-value requirement on loans by the Export-Import Bank of local
                        currencies under the Cooley Amendment to Public Law 480, and said that this
                        raised the question of the interest rate. The interest rates on Cooley
                        Amendment loans were comparable to those charged in the borrowing countries,
                        so as to avoid interference with local banking systems. He said that the
                        Export-Import Bank had had no adverse comment from borrowers concerning the
                        level of interest rates on these loans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1"
                            >Waugh</persName> felt that there was need for a general review of
                        interest rates on U.S. Government loans, in view of the rise in the cost of
                        money to the U.S. Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMS1">Szymczak</persName> said that United States
                        assistance to foreign countries through the PL 480 program should be dual,
                        first through the sale of commodities for local currencies, and second
                        through the use of the local currencies in ways that would help the economy
                        of the foreign country. If maintenance of value on the loans were abandoned
                        and the interest rates were unduly low, the result would be harmful
                        inflationary pressure on the foreign economy. Therefore, the Federal Reserve
                        view was that the interest rate should be related to economic conditions of
                        the country. Specifically, it should be related to local interest rates
                        charged to private borrowers.</p>
                    <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0138"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> suggested that the general
                        interest rate question be deferred for further discussion in the Staff
                        Committee and the Council. He agreed that the United States had a major
                        responsibility to program foreign aid so as to be helpful in terms of local
                        economic conditions. The U.S. Operations Missions gave this problem
                        continuous attention. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said
                        he would like to avoid fixed and rigid regulations, especially since the
                        rate of interest was important from the foreign policy point of view, as for
                        example, in relation to the low rates of interest charged by the Soviet
                        Union. The Department of State would like to increase the interest rates on
                        PL 480 loans to 4 percent for loans for economic overhead projects and to
                        local rates of interest on loans for profit-earning types of projects. A
                        loan to a government for a project such as a fertilizer plant, which would
                        normally be a profit-earning enterprise, should take the higher interest
                        rate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that there had been
                        discussion by the Council on Foreign Economic Policy of a proposal that the
                        PL 480 program should be made more flexible, and that in order to avoid
                        accumulation of local currencies and to increase the possibility of
                        psychological advantage, a large part of the program should be transferred
                        to Title II for use in the form of grants. The consensus of the Council on
                        Foreign Economic Policy had been that this approach would involve undue
                        difficulties, and that other ways were available to attain the desired
                        objectives. It had also been the consensus that the problem of accumulation
                        of local currency should be dealt with by appropriate changes in the waiver
                        procedure concerning the requirements of Section 1415 (of the Supplemental
                        Appropriation Act of 1953), so as to facilitate the further use of grants.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated that the
                        Department of State would consult with the Director of the Bureau of the
                        Budget to develop proposals along these lines.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kearns</persName> objected to too rigid a rule
                        for the determination of interest rates to private borrowers. An interest
                        rate, for example, of 15 to 20 percent per annum would be oppressive and
                        would cause difficulties. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName>
                        noted that the highest interest rate on Cooley Amendment loans was 10
                        percent per annum, and that the approval of the foreign governments would
                        have to be obtained for any PL 480 loans to private borrowers. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the interest rates on such
                        loans should conform to the practices of the Export-Import Bank on the
                        Cooley Amendment loans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> expressed support for a
                        position substantially along the lines outlined by the Federal Reserve
                        Board, inasmuch as a quid-pro-quo was involved in giving up maintenance of
                        value. He expressed doubt that the maintenance-of-value requirement had been
                        a serious obstacle to the conclusion of PL 480 loan agreements, since
                        disbursements under loan agreements which had been signed amounted to about
                        $1.6 billion. He also expressed doubt that the maintenance-of-value <pb
                            n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0139"/>requirement had limited the
                        magnitude of the programs, which was fundamentally determined by budgetary
                        requirements rather than the attitudes of prospective foreign borrowers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMS1">Szymczak</persName> reiterated the need for
                        maintaining financial stability in countries receiving aid, and noted the
                        importance of interest rates in this effort. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> agreed, and cited the successes of the aid program
                        administrators in maintaining financial stability in countries like Greece
                        and Korea.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJB1">Baird</persName> said that in principle the
                        Treasury saw merit in the Federal Reserve Board view, but that in view of
                        foreign policy considerations it did not seem desirable to press that view
                        to the ultimate conclusion. He noted that the loan repayments would be in
                        local currency and thus would not affect the United States budget. He raised
                        the question of when a decision to abandon maintenance of value would become
                        effective.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> suggested that the date on
                        which the policy would become effective, and the question of retroactive
                        application of the policy, should be decided after further Staff Committee
                        discussion. It was desired to keep a maintenance-of-value requirement on
                        dollar loans which were repayable in local currency, and it would be
                        undesirable to have the dropping of maintenance-of-value on PL 480 loans
                        raise questions on the maintenance-of-value requirement on dollar loans. He
                        felt that the matter should be explored further by the Staff Committee.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion the Council agreed in principle that the
                        maintenance-of-value requirement on loans of local currency should be
                        eliminated, and that the interest rate for such loans should cover the cost
                        of money to the Treasury for loans for economic overhead projects and should
                        currently be at the rate of 4 percent; the rate should follow local interest
                        rates on loans for profit-making types of enterprises. The Council requested
                        the Staff Committee to work out the details of the application of this
                        principle, including the time at which it should become applicable, and to
                        present an appropriate draft action for Council approval. (The Staff
                        Committee subsequently considered the matter and agreed on a recommended
                        action for the consideration of the Council which was approved by a
                        telephone poll completed on April 14, 1959. (See Staff Committee Minutes

                    <p>The Acting Chairman noted that the foregoing discussion had dealt only with
                        loans of local currencies, and said that questions had been raised
                        concerning interest rates on loans of dollars. He asked if the Council
                        wished to discuss this subject.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> indicated that he would like
                        to see the general question discussed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said he was not prepared for a full-scale discussion
                        at the present meeting, but that given time for preparation he would be
                        willing to have a general discussion. He said it should be borne in mind
                        that the Development Loan Fund was a major foreign policy instrument and
                        that there were real problems in meeting the competition of Soviet loans,
                        which recently had been made at interest rates of 2½ percent and on
                        progressively softer repayment terms. He pointed out that the Development
                        Loan Fund operation as a whole, in terms of loans already made, involved a
                        weighted average interest rate of 4.1 percent, and on this basis was meeting
                        the cost of money to the Treasury. He said he would be reluctant to change
                        the basic <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> interest rate unless it were
                        necessary in connection with bringing interest rates on all U.S. Government
                        domestic lending programs into line with the cost of money to the
                        Treasury.</p>

                        <item>The coming of convertibility for all major currencies should radically
                            change the attitude taken toward continuing discrimination against
                            dollar imports by European countries. As long as European currencies
                            were to some degree inconvertible, it could be argued that inability to
                            convert non-dollar earnings into dollars provided a justification for
                            discrimination. The discrimination, either by means of exchange
                            licensing or import licensing, was designed to make it easier to <pb

                        <item>Discrimination against dollar goods is still substantial, especially
                            in the case of the United Kingdom and France. These countries admit that
                            what they call “financial reasons” for discrimination have largely
                            disappeared with the coming of convertibility. But they offer other
                            reasons for continuing to discriminate. These include: (a) Reluctance to
                            eliminate discrimination against the dollar area by shifting to global
                            quotas, since this would mean reimposing quotas against <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> countries, (b) Alleged adverse
                            balance of payments impact if quotas against dollar goods were removed,
                            (c) Alleged need of discriminatory bilateral arrangements for balance of
                            payments reasons.</item>

                            (a) Jointly with Canada, the United States endeavored to obtain a

                            recent French consultation, to the effect there was no longer any

                            yielded to European, including United Kingdom, objections, and accepted
                            the plea that it was premature to press the issue, (b) The U.S.
                            spokesman at the current <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> meeting
                            in Geneva made a strong statement to the effect that it was time for
                            discrimination to end. This has called forth very strong French
                            reactions, French officials complaining that the United States appears
                            to be abandoning its support for European integration which, both in the

                            continues to be based in part on discrimination against dollar

                                    investment portfolio, in view of the increase in Fund quotas,
                                    the consequent decrease in the Fund’s income, and the
                                    desirability of increasing the Fund’s reserve accounts.</item>

                                    approximately $30 million. This is a small figure, compared with
                                        <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> reserves of more than
                                    $350 million, and considering Fund assets which will exceed $14

                                    commitments amounting to $1.5 billion. It would not be
                                    unreasonable for the Fund to have reserves upwards of $100
                                    million. The present Fund investment portfolio yields only $3
                                    million to $6 million per year, depending on the rate of U.S.

                    <p>Upon returning from the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> Conference
                        which took place in Paris May 25–26, I had occasion to give a brief report
                        of my impressions to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> and Chairman Martin.<note n="1" xml:id="d48fn1"

                            Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</note>
                        In the course of these conversations, I mentioned the apparently growing
                        concern about the U.S. dollar that some European representatives had voiced
                        privately. This concern had to do not so much with devaluation, but with a
                        possible wave of speculation against the dollar and with the repercussions
                        of a further gold outflow on American economic policy. I should add that I
                        tried to avoid conversation on this subject and, where that was not
                        possible, dealt with it as a balance of payments problem rather than a gold
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>These impressions, fragmentary as they are, raise an obvious question: what
                        can we do to discourage speculation against the dollar in the face of
                        further gold losses? Our basic reply we have already given by our show of
                        firm determination to pursue sound monetary and fiscal policies. Further
                        proof of our determination to defend the dollar could be given by removing
                        the 25 percent gold reserve requirement to which the Federal Reserve’s
                        liabilities are subject. I mentioned this possibility to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> and Chairman Martin. Chairman
                        Martin said that at the present time he would not be in favor of such
                        action; consequently I shall not press the matter further. It seems
                        worthwhile, however, to summarize briefly the pro’s and con’s of the case,
                        which in part appeared in these conversations.</p>

                    <p>By removing the 25 percent requirement, we would be unfreezing approximately
                        $11.6 billion of gold tied up in domestic reserves as of June 10. We would
                        then have $20 billion to meet any future gold drain, instead of $8.3, as at
                        present.</p>

                            devaluation. We would be scotching reports such as that attributed to
                            Franz Pick, who seems to claim close contact with top men in Washington,
                            that the Administration has set $18 billion as the minimum level that
                            reserves would be allowed to reach before we devalue.</item>

                        <item>A change in the 25 percent reserve ratio may eventually become
                            necessary for another reason: the prospect of a continuing growth in the
                            Fed’s liabilities subject to reserve requirements. This growth can and
                            has been held down by reductions in member bank reserve requirements.
                            But over the long pull, the Fed’s liabilities subject to reserve
                            requirements are apt to grow. If they were to expand proportionately to
                            the money supply, i.e., at 3–4 percent per year, we would be adding
                            close to half a billion cash a year to required gold reserves. Our
                            present free reserves of $8.3 billion would disappear in 15–20 years.
                            While to acquire more gold in such amounts does not seem practicable,
                            since that would mean to absorb close to two-thirds of the world’s gold
                            production available for monetary purposes, for reasons of international
                            liquidity as well as of domestic expansion, therefore, something
                            eventually may have to be done about the 25 percent requirement.</item>
                        <label>c)</label>
                        <item>These considerations may not appear particularly pressing with a $20
                            billion level of total reserves. But if by the end of the year reserves
                            should be in the 17–18 billion area the urgency would increase.</item>

                    <p>The basic purpose of the 25 percent requirement is to impose a certain
                        discipline upon our policies. Removal of the requirement would also remove
                        the discipline. How does this discipline operate today? <list>

                            <item>The sound monetary and fiscal policies of the Administration are
                                being pursued primarily because of their intrinsic merit and not
                                because of any pressure resulting from an anticipated short fall of
                                central bank reserves. The large gold loss last year no doubt has
                                added some urgency to these policies. I would not undertake to judge
                                whether, with a similar gold loss, that sense of urgency would have
                                been any less had the 25 percent requirement not been in
                                existence.</item>

                            <item>The discipline may also take the form of a growing pressure to
                                restrict imports, capital exports, and foreign aid. These are
                                undesirable effects, except in the eyes of those who are skeptical
                                of the present level of our foreign aid. These perverse discipline
                                effects are likely to increase as our free gold reserves diminish.
                                They would be reduced, though scarcely eliminated altogether, by a
                                removal of the 25 percent requirement.</item>

                            <item>Nevertheless, the discipline exercised by falling reserves would
                                serve a useful purpose in the event that the passive state of our
                                balance of payments should prove to be permanent. In that case, it
                                is clear that we shall have to do more to correct it than we have
                                done. We ought to try to do this as much as possible by expanding
                                our exports and other international receipts, and only secondarily
                                by bringing down our outpayments. If that should be the underlying
                                truth of our situation, it would be better to face it now with 8.3
                                billion of free and 12 billion of frozen reserves, than to unfreeze
                                the 12 billion, use them up, and then face the same issue again a
                                few years from now.</item>

                            <item>The present situation also imposes a certain discipline upon
                                foreign countries: it makes them see the need to remove
                                discrimination against the dollar and to take over part of the
                                burden of financing underdeveloped countries, if they want to avoid
                                restrictive measures on our part. This discipline, for what it is
                                worth, would be weakened by a removal of the 25 percent
                                requirement.</item>

                    <p>The 25 percent reserve requirement can be suspended under Section 11 (C) of
                        the Federal Reserve Act. This section gives the Board the power to suspend
                        the requirements for a period of 30 days with successive extensions of 15
                        days each. For a reserve deficiency of up to 5 percent against Federal
                        Reserve notes, i.e., down to a reserve level of 20 percent, a penalty of
                        only 1 percent per annum is imposed. For each <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115"

                    <p>The substantial increase in the outflow of gold and in the level of foreign
                        liquid dollar holdings over the past year and a half have led to widespread
                        public and official attention to the overall international payments position
                        of the United States.</p>

                        trend in the United States balance of payments, and various suggestions are
                        being made as to measures designed to arrest the trend, including the
                        possibility of modifying the world-wide procurement policies now followed by

                        <item>The existing financial capability of the United States to cope with
                            large deficits in its international payments is still great. The United
                            States reserve is still very large, both absolutely and in relation to
                            reserves held elsewhere. There is no immediate threat to the strength of
                            the dollar, or to its standing as an international reserve
                            currency.</item>

                        <item>Concern about the very large deficit in the U.S. payments in 1958,
                            which is increasing in 1959, arises from the following considerations: <list>

                                <item>The 1958–59 deficit comes on top of a series of smaller but
                                    persistent yearly deficits going back to 1950.</item>

                                <item>The 1958–59 deficit may imply a weakening of the international
                                    competitive position of U.S. producers. This comes in a period
                                    when U.S. capital outflows have increased and require a
                                    corresponding increase in the U.S. export surplus if losses of
                                    gold and dollar assets are not to be excessive. (The decline in
                                    U.S. exports has been due partly to special non-recurrent
                                    factors, partly to world-wide recession and general contraction
                                    of trade, and partly to a decline in the U.S. share of the world
                                    market for manufactures. The last development has been largely
                                    the result of the improved position of West Germany and
                                    Japan.)</item>

                        <item><p>In the period 1950 through 1957, increasing amounts of funds in the
                                form of capital and military expenditures left the United States.
                                But these were largely offset by U.S. surpluses on trade and
                                services. Thus, the annual U.S. balance of payments deficit was less
                                than $2 billion. In 1958 there was still a substantial surplus on
                                current account (comparing favorably with prior years except 1956
                                and 1957), but capital outflows were considerably higher than in the
                                pre-1956 period.</p>
                            <p>The situation altered markedly in 1959, with a large reduction in the
                                U.S. export surplus. The latest estimate for 1959 is for a drop in
                                the surplus on trade and services by $2.5 billion below that of
                                1958. This will increase the U.S. overall deficit by almost the same
                                amount. The change is nearly all in the merchandise trade account: a
                                slight further decline of exports and a $2 billion increase in
                                imports. The overall deficit for 1959 is estimated at $5
                                billion.</p></item>

                                    misleading. The year 1950 preceded the start of the real

                                    expenditures. Also, in 1950 Germany and Japan were bearing a
                                    major portion of the cost of maintaining U.S. forces in their

                                and continued to rise more moderately to $3.4 billion by 1958. The
                                $3.4 billion military expenditures in 1958 was larger than either
                                net private investment ($2.9 billion as compared with $1.3 billion
                                in 1950) or net government economic grants and loans ($2.6 billion,
                                as compared with $3.6 billion in 1950.) Moreover, it was heavily
                                concentrated, as was private investment, in Western Europe, Canada
                                and Japan, all of whose reserves have been rising.</p></item>

                            in gold [and?] in dollars appears to have been achieved through (a) the
                            acquisition of new gold production and Soviet gold sales to the extent
                            of about $900 million and (b) earnings of $1.2 billion from third
                            countries paid to Western Europe from the payments surpluses of such
                            countries with the United States. The capacity of Europe to earn gold
                            and dollars from the rest of the world was markedly influenced by a
                            shift in the terms of trade in favor of Europe. With respect to capital
                            outflow, an increased proportion has not been linked directly to U.S.
                            exports. One factor in this trend has been the increase in foreign
                            security flotations in the U.S. which amounted to $345 million in
                            1953–55 (annual average) compared with $1,750 million in 1958.</item>

                        <item>An approach to adjustment in the U.S. balance of payments would
                            therefore appear to lie primarily in the direction of (a) increasing the
                            U.S. current account surplus, especially with Western Europe, through
                            normal trade and services transactions and possibly through requiring
                            payment for transfers of military equipment; (b) reducing where possible
                            U.S. military expenditures in Western Europe; and (c) increasing the
                            flow of long-term capital from Western Europe to third countries,
                            particularly the less-developed areas. The last is called for by the
                            increased economic and financial strength of Western Europe. If such
                            capital assistance were available on an untied basis, it might have some
                            favorable effect on the U.S. balance of payments, though its impact is
                            likely to be slight and slow.</item>

                        <item>It is highly unlikely that a policy of tying Development Loan Fund
                            loans to procurement in the United States would itself materially
                            improve the U.S. balance of payments. Tying is not likely to alter the
                            more basic factors influencing the U.S. balance of payments as a whole.
                            Moreover, tying of <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans would
                            either work a hardship on the very countries whose reserves are low,
                            whose payments position is poor, and whose economies we are trying to
                            help in our overall national interest, or it would necessitate larger
                                <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> expenditures to achieve our
                            objectives.</item>

                        <item>The main case for the principle of tying <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                                >DLF</gloss> loans is to use it as a threat to persuade Western
                            European countries to expand their long-term lending to the
                            less-developed areas (i.e. “to finance their own surplus”) and to do so
                            on an untied basis. But if the threat has to be carried out, it will
                            very probably have lost its effectiveness. The main impediment to
                            European long-term government lending is the absence of necessary
                            government policies and institutions. The mere practice of tying
                            individual U.S. loans is not likely to bring these institutions into
                            being. Also, there may result a dangerous expansion of European short or
                            medium term credit of the export credit insurance variety which is not
                            suitable to development needs. Nevertheless, the possibility of tying
                                <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans should be used by the U.S.
                            in negotiations with Western European governments aimed at obtaining a
                            substantial increase in European long-term capital.</item>

                        <item>Efforts to adjust the U.S. balance of payments over the years ahead
                            can be either expansive or restrictive. As the postwar experience of
                            Western Europe amply demonstrates, restrictive or discriminatory methods
                            serve to suppress and conceal the symptoms of imbalance. They do not
                            promote, and usually impede, sound adjustments in the balance of
                            payments, which can only come about through the pressures of competitive
                            market forces operating within a framework of sound fiscal and monetary
                            policy. Efforts to promote adjustment in the U.S. balance of payments
                            should be of a non-restrictive character, designed to encourage balance
                            at as high a level of international trade and payments as possible. The
                            size of U.S. reserves and the basic strength of the U.S. economy allow
                            ample time for such a policy to be fully tested.</item>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I thought that you should be
                        made aware of two impending financial transactions, the second of which, if
                        it is to be completed, requires your formal approval.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Prepayment by British of Loan from the
                            Export-Import Bank</hi></p>
                    <p>You will recall that, as a result of the Suez crisis, the British pound came
                        under pressure late in 1956, with the result that the British arranged for a
                        drawing from the International Monetary Fund of $561 million and also, in
                        February, 1957, obtained a secured credit from the Eximbank of $500 million
                        with interest at 4½%. Under the terms of the Eximbank credit, any advances
                        were to be repaid in ten semiannual installments, the first to be due in
                        three years from the date of the loan disbursement. Drawing rights under the
                        original credit were to extend to January 31st, 1958, but a further
                        extension was granted to February 28, 1959. Provision was made for a
                        commitment fee of 1/4th of 1% on the unused portion of the credit. That
                        extension period has now expired.</p>
                    <p>In October, 1957, the British Treasury drew $250 million on the Eximbank
                        credit, which amount is still outstanding.</p>
                    <p>Due to courageous corrective measures taken by the British Government,
                        Britain’s balance of payments situation has sharply improved, as indicated
                        by an increase in the British holdings of gold and dollars from a low point
                        of about $1.8 billion in 1957 to over $3.2 billion at the present time. That
                        is after the repayment in March of this year of $200 million to the
                        International Monetary Fund on the 1956 advance and payment of $162 million
                        in gold as additional subscription to the Fund. Despite this, it is
                        estimated that Britain’s holdings of gold and dollars will increase
                        something like $300 million in calendar 1959, in which year it is estimated
                        the United States will have a comparable loss of $4.5 billion in the balance
                        of payments.</p>
                    <p>The British have come to believe (with some tactful encouragement from us)
                        that their position is now sufficiently strong so that it might be advisable
                        for them to repay the $250 million advanced by the Eximbank, thereby saving
                        the interest charge on that amount. However, their willingness to thus repay
                        will be contingent on the Eximbank agreeing to reinstate the credit to the
                        extent of $250 million <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0154"/>but with any
                        drawing under the credit requiring payment within the original time limit
                        and at the same rate of interest. The Eximbank is also asked to waive any
                        commitment fee on the restored $250 million of the credit.</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer has advised us that the timing and final details of this
                        transaction will be worked out when the Chancellor is here in Washington in
                        late September, but he also indicates that it is the present intention to
                        complete the transaction before the end of our current fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>When the advance of $250 million was made by the Eximbank in 1957, it
                        increased expenditures in the budget to that extent. Similarly, repayment to
                        the Eximbank, when made, will have a budgetary impact in the opposite
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>The F.Y. 1960 budget contemplates that the Eximbank will make no net claim on
                        the Treasury, that is, that it will try to sell to the commercial banks
                        participations in its present loans up to an amount of $234 million, which,
                        taken with repayments on existing loans, will offset new loan disbursements.
                        If this is achieved, the $250 million to be received from the British
                        Treasury as a prepayment will have the effect of reducing expenditures in
                        the 1960 F.Y. budget by a like amount. If there should be any short-fall in
                        the sales of participations just referred to, the British prepayment will
                        more than offset it.</p>

                        involve the sale to the U.S. Treasury of $300 million of gold. Plans are
                        being worked out with the Fund management to obtain a matching, so far as
                        possible, of such purchases of gold by the Treasury with prospective sales
                        of gold by the U.S. Treasury to other countries, thus avoiding, to that
                        extent, unnecessary distortions in the U.S. gold stock. Aside from lessening
                        the decline in the U.S. gold stock, the investment by the Fund of the
                        proceeds of the gold sales will provide appreciable support to the market
                        for U.S. Treasury bills in the weeks ahead.</p>
                    <p>The National Advisory Council has already taken action to approve the U.S.
                        Executive Director of the Fund concurring in the decision to sell the gold
                        and invest the proceeds as described. The Council has also approved the U.S.
                        Treasury entering into an agreement to resell an equivalent amount of gold
                        to the Fund on demand, paralleling what was done in 1956.</p>
                    <p>The Council has also approved my recommending to you that the 1/4th of 1%
                        charge on purchases and sales of gold by the U.S. should be waived with
                        respect to the proposed transaction, as, under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934
                        and existing delegations of authority, the Secretary of the Treasury may buy
                        and sell gold without such a charge only with your approval. As this
                        transaction serves our interest as well as the Fund’s, this waiver of charge
                        is warranted and was similarly granted by you in respect to the 1956
                        transaction.</p>

                        <item>Aside from the effect of International Bank borrowing on the
                            management of the U.S. public debt, it should be remembered that the
                            Treasury has begun to view the Bank’s lending and borrowing in the light
                            of their effect on the U.S. balance of payments. These considerations
                            will become increasingly important as time goes on.</item>

                            which have adequate gold and dollar reserves. In this connection, we
                            were glad to note that the Bank is not contemplating additional loans to
                            Italy in the near future and hopes that similar consideration will apply
                            to some other European borrowers (France).</item>

                        <item>The U.S. would like to have more information well in advance of any
                            commitment by the Bank on future loans so that our views may be brought
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName>’s attention without
                            creating embarrassment, either for the Bank or for the U.S. The balance
                            of payments problem makes this particularly important.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The Bank should seek to obtain as much of its financing as it possibly
                            can outside of the U.S. While we recognize the difficulties in floating
                            long-term issues abroad, we feel that it would be better for the Bank to
                            float short-term issues abroad than to rely so heavily on the American
                            market. In connection with the specific $200 million loan, the Treasury
                            will not object if appropriate timing can be arranged. We would hope
                            that the balance of the Bank’s financing during the current year could
                            be obtained abroad. If this is not possible, we would hope to have
                            further prior consultation before the Bank proposes new issues in the
                            U.S. market.</item>

                        Executive Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMW1">Marion W. Boggs</persName>,
                        dated April 2, reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> reported
                                that the West Germans were embarrassed by their large holdings of
                                foreign exchange. Consequently they have sent $600 million to the
                                U.S. as an advance payment on their mutual security obligations.
                                This sum has been invested in short-term U.S. Government securities.
                                By contrast, the U.K. is becoming sensitive to its losses of foreign
                                exchange. The U.K. Government was considering inserting a statement
                                in the next Budget Message that the U.K. held $800 million to a
                                billion dollars worth of U.S. industrial securities. It had not yet
                                been decided to make such a statement because of its possible effect
                                on the stock market and because the Laborites might say to the
                                Government ‘Why were not these securities sold last October when
                                their value was greater than at present?’ The President wondered
                                whether it was not to our advantage to have funds such as those sent
                                here by West Germany invested in our securities. Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said these funds would be
                                invested in our securities even if held by the Germans until
                                payments were due. In response to a question from Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the German
                                reserves of foreign exchange amounted to $5 billion. Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said the Germans
                                were shying away from foreign assistance programs because a large
                                proportion of any sum which they provided in assistance to
                                underdeveloped countries would be spent in West Germany. Germany
                                preferred to lend money to underdeveloped countries if the money
                                would be spent elsewhere than in West Germany. Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said the advance payment
                                by West Germany on its mutual security obligations had raised the
                                question in his mind whether we should suggest that various other
                                European countries take similar action. The President thought it
                                might be desirable to make such a suggestion. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said advance payments by
                                European countries on their mutual security obligations before June
                                30 would be very helpful. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2"
                                    >Herter</persName> asked when these mutual security payments
                                were actually due. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                                    >Anderson</persName> replied that the payments were due when

                                    >Dillon</persName> said various countries were buying military
                                equipment from us for cash; the West Germans had simply put up the
                                cash in advance of receiving the equipment. Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that as a matter of
                                bookkeeping, the West Germans could show their advance payment as a
                                payment made, but we could not show it as a payment received until
                                we made the necessary deliveries of military equipment.” (Eisenhower

                        was also present; the portion which related to the balance-of-payments

                                about shifting the currency base from dollars to gold, in part as a
                                means of putting pressure on the United States to accede to some of

                                this would destroy at their very heart the security arrangements in

                    </list>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> told the President
                        that the purpose of his visit was to inform him about the recent
                        developments in the London gold market. Prices had reached a peak of about
                        $40.60 per ounce on October 20th, but had receded to a somewhat lower level
                        during the following days. At the time of the visit the quotation was
                        $37.25–$37.75. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        indicated that one important reason for this development had been the
                        continued weakness of the U.S. balance of payments which had induced
                        foreigners to purchase gold both for investment and as a speculation on a
                        possible devaluation of the dollar. A Director of the Bank of England and a
                        representative of the Chancellor of the Exchequer had conferred with Messrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> and Martin and others on
                        October 25th and there was full agreement with them on the interpretation of
                        the recent events and on the manner in which this situation should be
                        handled in the future. The British representatives understand that the
                        operation of the London gold market was their responsibility, although
                        events in that market are a matter of common interest to all Western Nations
                        because of the psychological effects. British representatives understand
                        that there is and will be no criticism on the part of U.S. officials if they
                        feel that they have to undertake sales of their own gold in order to
                        maintain an orderly market. They will keep U.S. officials closely advised of
                        their actions and there will be future opportunities for mutual exchanges of
                        information.</p>

                    <p>The President questioned as to whether the Germans, who were obligated to the
                        United States because of past help, should not be asked to go into the
                        London market to bring the price down to $35 per ounce.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> stressed that as
                        the result of the events in the London gold market we may have to pay out
                        gold for practically all of our balance of payments deficit. He underlined
                        that the basic situation required a strengthening of our balance of payments
                        situation and the need to have this in mind in connection with the U.S.
                        procurement policies of our foreign aid and our foreign military
                        expenditures, especially in Germany where we spend annually over $600
                        million for military expenses. Mention was made in this connection of the
                        forthcoming visit to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                            >Adenauer</persName> by Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"

                            which called attention to the consistent German balance-of-payments
                            surplus and urged increased German financing for development in the
                            less-developed areas, assumption of some of the cost of U.S. defense
                            forces in Germany, and a larger market in Germany for goods from the
                            United States and the developing countries. <persName corresp="#p_AK1"

                        the President said should occur as soon as possible and should involve a
                        strong effort on our part. The President feels that these discussions with
                        the Germans, and possibly other Europeans, should be pressed as much as
                        possible while he is in office because of the relationship he has
                        established with the British, French and General DeGaulle on the basis of
                        mutual integrity and trust. He indicated that Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> wanted him to come to Europe in
                        December to address <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and he wondered
                        whether such a meeting, if it did take place, should be used to further our
                        above mentioned objectives.</p>
                    <p>The President mentioned a newspaper article by Sylvia Porter which had
                        indicated that higher expenditures by the U.S. and a lower budgetary surplus
                        would be beneficial to the country. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> and Martin discussed this point with the President
                        at some length and, among others, pointed out the unfavorable effect of such
                        policies on the balance of payments.</p>

                        below $18 billion for the first time in many, many years. $12 billion worth
                        of gold is required to cover our currency, in accordance with law. There are
                        $9.5 billion in instant demands against us that can be filed at any time. He
                        said he did not know what further orders for sale of gold will come in, but
                        many small countries are coming in to ask for their gold, of which they have
                        about $2 billion in demand claims. He read off a list of some twenty small
                        countries now asking us to provide their gold to them.</p>
                    <p>The President noted that many of these countries are receiving substantial
                        assistance from us and said that perhaps we should stop giving aid to them.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said the problem they
                        face—which is a real one—is that they could not stand the loss that would be
                        involved if the dollar were to decline in value.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said there are three
                        areas in which actions respecting the gold situation might be taken. The
                        first of these pertains to trade—tariffs, customs, etc. To act in this area
                        would be a reversal of policies we have worked hard to place in effect in
                        the United States. The second area of action is monetary. Congress could be
                        asked to reduce the requirement for 25% cover for our currency. This would
                        set off the biggest monetary debate in our history with terribly damaging
                        effects. The President commented that the gain from decreasing this
                        percentage would simply be a temporary one. In addition, we could change the
                        dollar price of gold but others would do the same and we would have gained
                        nothing. Also we could let the price fluctuate, with much the same effect.
                        In addition, we could embargo the export of gold. This would destroy the
                        international gold standard in our lifetimes, but would not destroy our own
                        monetary system. A further step <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0163"
                        />would be to prohibit the holding of gold abroad by Americans. If we were
                        to do this, other countries would take this as a sign that we are going to
                        devalue our gold, and start a run on our gold stocks. This effect could,
                        however, be alleviated by allowing something like a year for people to
                        dispose of their gold holdings. None of these steps appears too attractive.
                        There is a third field in which the United States can act alone. We can cut
                        down and in some cases eliminate the stationing of dependents of military
                        and civilian personnel abroad. We can reduce our troops overseas. We can
                        stop the procurement of non-U.S. items for our post exchanges and
                        commissaries. In our development aid to underdeveloped countries, we can tie
                        our loans to purchases of U.S. products. We can stop the procurement by our
                        military services of supplies from foreign sources. And we can slow down and
                        impede the arrangements for our tourists going abroad.</p>
                    <p>The President said he had another idea he wanted to have discussed. We now
                        have about $21 billion worth of refined uranium and plutonium. This has
                        great future value as a source of power. He wondered if this could be
                        substituted for gold. Gold became the currency base because of its general
                        usefulness and desirability. Uranium has now become valuable and could
                        perhaps be used in the same way. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> noted that gold is worth only what it can be used
                        for, and much of its value is purely psychological. He indicated question as
                        to whether uranium could be brought into the same kind of use.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> went on to say that our
                        military expenditures abroad amount to something like $3 billion a year, of
                        which $1 billion is for uranium. Our own supplies of uranium are more than
                        ample now but we are committed to long-term purchases from South Africa. The
                        President said he is all for everything we can do to stop the outflow of
                        gold. He knew the actions would not be easy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said that basically the strength of the U.S. dollar
                        is not its gold support but the functioning of our economy. However, the
                        fact is that gold activities can damage our military system and our economy
                        as well as the world economy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said that, as soon as it became apparent Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was the probable victor
                        in the election, confidence in the U.S. dollar declined rapidly and demands
                        for gold arose so that by now we have almost a gold panic situation. With
                        confidence disappearing, we are at the point where the world monetary
                        system, and our own, can be wrecked within a few short weeks. He said he had
                        given a great deal of thought to the steps that might be taken. He
                        recognized that it might be preferable to restrict tourists and to bring
                        home military dependents. He was sure that if we were to raise tariffs there
                        would be a rush to high protection both in the United States and around the
                        world. We have increased our exports to a marked degree this year, and
                        cannot expect to do much better on this score. In fact, our favorable export
                        position this year is in part due to a <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132"
                            facs="0164"/>surge of buying abroad—particularly of jet aircraft. We are
                        at the point where it is imperative to do something quickly and dramatically
                        to try to restore confidence. His suggestion is that we do now what we can
                        unilaterally. Beyond this we should take monetary steps. Only as a last
                        resort should we move in the area of restricting trade.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would add that a first step is that we must without
                        fail balance our budget both for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–61 and
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–62. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> agreed, saying it is necessary both to achieve a
                        better international balance of payments and to pay as we go domestically,
                        because much of the loss of confidence in the dollar has come from the
                        prospect of inflation under the new administration. The President noted in
                        passing that we could help ourselves substantially by selling U–235 to
                        France, at the same time saving France the necessity of making great capital
                        outlays for a separation plant.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said that he wanted the
                        group to know that at the moment we appear to be in the red for fiscal year
                        1961. Profits are down, with corresponding drop in tax receipts, and
                        expenditures are running above the budget, notably in Defense. He said it
                        would take drastic action to put us into the black again for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–61, but said it could be done. With regard to
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–62, the first run out of a budget
                        shows a deficit of the order of several billion dollars. Much can be done to
                        improve upon this but here again there is a real question as to whether we
                        can show a balanced budget. He said he is going back over all the
                        submissions to try to force them down. He said his main complaint with the
                        action proposed is that they do not go far enough. He thought we are at the
                        point where we must cut our troops in Germany, without waiting to see what
                        the Germans are willing to contribute. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said he thought it was essential that these steps
                        be decided upon and announced before he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> meet with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                            >Adenauer</persName>. Maintaining our forces abroad costs us something
                        like $685 million a year in adverse impact on our balance of payments. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that this figure
                        could be cut to about $250 million by bringing our dependents out of Europe.
                        The President said that the tour of duty there could be cut to something
                        like eighteen months. In Europe this ought to be acceptable. He thought Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> should not go to the
                        services on this matter, but should tell them what is to be done. He also
                        thought we should not spend so much abroad for military procurement.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that this
                        action does not signify that we have followed the wrong policies in the
                        past. The fact is that we are in a new situation wherein there is an
                        intolerable drain on our gold. He suggested that the group take a few days
                        to study the matter but reiterated that he thinks it is essential to do this
                        before he visits Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        agreed that action should be taken to cut down dependents before the visit
                        is made. The President said that this action <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133"
                            facs="0165"/>should include cutting down on the dependents of Foreign
                        Service personnel, except for the Ambassador or one or two top aides. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> said that the best way to
                        make a cut of this kind is the stupid way—that is to impose a percentage
                        cut. Nothing else will work. He asked that the President not single out the
                        military to have them without their dependents, and thus make them
                        second-class citizens. The President said he had no intention of doing that.
                        He noted that other countries do not have the tremendous embassy staffs that
                        we seem to have, nor do they have large numbers of personnel in technical
                        areas such as agriculture, labor, etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> referred to personnel of <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss>, and said that many of these families can be brought
                        back.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he would like
                        to see this made a Presidential directive and kept very secret for the
                        moment. The President said it must become a public document when approved.
                        He reverted to the desirability of lifting restrictions regarding the sale
                        of U–235 abroad.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> said he is in complete agreement with the
                        actions proposed. He said the situation will certainly get away from us
                        unless we act quickly to stop this outflow.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested there are many things that can be done, such as
                        slowing down the processing of passports, so as to cut down on tourism. He
                        asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> to serve as
                        Chairman of the group to iron out what can be done. He noted that if this is
                        talked about in the Defense establishment, it will leak to the press.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_PGWB1">Persons</persName> said there have
                        already been stories in the press about it. Finally, the President said
                        there could be cuts made in military manpower, including military attachés
                        and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>s. He thought great reductions
                        could be made in the personnel in our embassies.</p>
                    <p>Following the meeting, the President asked me to stay in touch with what is
                        done to see that the same principles are applied to Foreign Service and
                        other non-military personnel as to military personnel. I told him I was
                        still unsatisfied on this whole matter inasmuch as the steps that were being
                        discussed did not account for more than 1/10 of the net gold outflow. The
                        real cause of gold outflow is a rush of investment money abroad, largely to
                        profitable areas in Western Europe, the net effect of which ties dollars
                        down for long-term investments, with the receiving countries converting them
                        immediately into demand claims against our gold. Until something is done
                        about this these other moves are not substantial except for their
                        psychological effect. The President agreed but noted that no one had come to
                        him with any plan to deal with this aspect of the matter.</p>

                                267</ref>.</note> He discussed the effects of aid to these countries
                        on our problem of balance of payments. He noted that in the State/Defense
                        letter the amount of grant aid going to these three countries had been
                        estimated at less than 5% of the total MAP costs. The Government and the
                        nation must know that we are now in the process of taking the most austere
                        measures to solve this problem of balance of payments.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he had strong
                        feelings regarding continued military assistance to Italy, Belgium and the
                        Netherlands. He disagrees with the State/Defense position that aid to these
                        nations does not affect our balance of payments. He took issue with the
                        argument that balance of payments is not affected when we deliver matériel
                        made in the U.S. He pointed out that sending matériel cuts down the market
                        in which the U.S. would share. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> believes these countries should be made to pay for
                        this equipment.</p>
                    <p>The President reminded the group that he had been preaching for eight years
                        that we had been too easy with Europe. He pointed out that when he went to
                        Europe as <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> in 1951 he had told
                        everyone that the measures we were taking were emergency measures only. In
                        this regard the President quoted the late Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> as having urged him continually to
                        maintain current force levels in Europe. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had said that morale would collapse
                        if one soldier were pulled back from the line.</p>
                    <p>At this point General <persName corresp="#p_GBGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>
                        read the draft directive to Governmental agencies regarding measures to
                        improve the balance of <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0167"/>payments
                            situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2">See <ref target="#d59">Document
                                59</ref>.</note> A discussion followed in which certain portions of
                        this directive were revised.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the timing of the impact of the balance of payments problem on the
                        U.S. economy, the President was of the opinion that we have had this subject
                        under consideration for some time longer than the two years specified in the
                        original draft directive. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">George
                            Humphrey</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">Secretary of the
                            Treasury, January 1953–July 1957.</note> had been calling attention to
                        this problem for some time before. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said that the problem became serious in 1957, the
                        year in which industrial plants in Europe were finished. He pointed out that
                        the situation which had worried <persName corresp="#p_HG2">George
                            Humphrey</persName> was so mild (consisting of a billion dollar deficit
                        per year) he himself would be happy, comparatively, to live with a situation
                        like that. The President directed that the wording be changed to show at
                        least that we had been aware of this problem all the time.</p>
                    <p>The President showed concern over the situation of dependents overseas and
                        asked how many dependents there are. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1"
                            >Gates</persName> said there are 500,000. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> expressed his concern that the
                        inevitable blow to morale might result in the onus being placed on the
                        President. The President said this fact did not concern him and that morale
                        will be all right if the proper leadership is exercised in the armed
                        services. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said we
                        will have to work toward a goal of 200,000 dependents, or a reduction of
                        60%.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> said there had been
                        approaches to this problem other than restriction on a strictly numerical
                        basis. One approach would be to specify that only those dependents could go
                        overseas who had Government housing provided for them. Another approach
                        would be merely to stop the travel of any further dependents, without
                        bringing home any which are already there.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed concern over the distribution of the 200,000
                        dependents. He is afraid that only dependents of generals and other high
                        ranking officers will be allowed to go. He said that he himself did not
                        worry much about morale of generals. In addition, generals’ wives spend more
                        money than do those of the lower ranks. He would like to see the lower ranks
                        favored in any provision for reducing the number of dependents overseas. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> said that under current
                        provisions all ranks above private and private first class are allowed to
                        take dependents with them.</p>
                    <p>With the editing of the directive finished, the President stated his
                        satisfaction with it as a document, describing it as a good piece of
                        educational literature. He wondered how to put it out without frightening
                        foreign banking circles. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said there is nothing in this directive affecting
                        the monetary field. The President said he <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136"
                            facs="0168"/>would like to have it stressed that the regulation of the
                        size of our gold reserve is a function of the Federal Reserve Board, which
                        takes into consideration international as well as domestic factors.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> then expressed deep
                        concern over the public relations impact of this directive. He predicted
                        that the military services will kick up a severe fuss and will point out
                        that dependents overseas contribute less to balance of payments deficit than
                        procurement of military items overseas. This action will have a severe
                        effect on our retention and enlistment rates. He is sure the dependents
                        phase of this move will be taken out of context and will become a tough item
                        politically; we cannot count on support from the armed services in this
                        regard.</p>
                    <p>The President then described the situation in North Africa in 1942 when
                        things were extremely bad. Ground movement was bogged down by mud and any
                        planes flying were certain to be German rather than American. At this time,
                        when morale was low, John L. Lewis<note n="4" xml:id="d58fn4">President of
                            the United Mine Workers of America.</note> had gone on strike to achieve
                        wage levels from $16 to $20 a day. The President himself had received many
                        questions on why troops were undergoing such hardships for $2 or $3 a day.
                        The fact of the matter is that the regular Services are enlisted for service
                        and not for personal gain. This means that we must convince people in the
                        Services that we are now at war, and they must take that attitude. As an
                        adjunct to the morale problem in the Services, the President said the State
                        Department must cut down the number of people in their embassies. Since
                        State Department is acutely aware of the balance of payment, it should
                        realize the nature of the problem and should take the initiative in cutting
                        down. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJH1">Whitney</persName> recently
                        told the President that he has 1500 people in his embassy and predicted
                        increased efficiency if this figure were cut 50%. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> expressed doubts on the way the
                        Services and the State Department would receive such measures, pointing out
                        we are now a spoiled people.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_GBGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> recommended that
                        the wording regarding the State Department be made stronger since the
                        wording in the original draft gave too much discretion. The President said
                        he would like to see a report from each Ambassador as the head of the
                        country team showing his recommendations for reduction of personnel in all
                        agencies in each country. General <persName corresp="#p_GBGAJ1"
                            >Goodpaster</persName> explained to the President his feeling that the
                        State Department should not be allowed undue leeway, as expressed in such
                        terms as “without impairing.” He himself is sure there will be great
                        repercussions to the cutback on dependents, and impairment of many of our
                        objectives affected by this. There will be resistance to these measures from
                        many quarters, including our allies, who are growing fat on the expenditures
                        of U.S. personnel <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0169"/>overseas. We will
                        pay a heavy cost for this move, and the only justification for it is that
                        the alternative to making this move would be the destruction of our monetary
                        system. If people can be made to realize this fact, the realization may
                        carry the day. He recognized the anguish which had been undergone by those
                        who had planned this directive. The President said he is willing to accept
                        this crisis, and to go ahead and do it. He himself will take the
                        responsibility. The nation has only two months in which to impeach him. He
                        reiterated that if the 200,000 dependents are provided for those in the
                        lower grades, morale will be OK. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1"
                            >Gates</persName> said this would mean that nobody would be allowed to
                        go abroad in the next year and a half if we are to effect the 60% cut. The
                        President agreed that the wording regarding the State Department must be
                        made tougher, despite Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName>’s statement that both Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had asked him over the phone not to
                        touch State.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the State Department must be thinning out
                        automatically with all the new embassies they are creating. He knows of no
                        increase in personnel of the foreign service. Just that day he had received
                        three requests for new embassies, which requests he had turned down. He had
                        specified that money can be saved if these offices remain legations. To top
                        it all, these locations are behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                    <p>Regarding implementation, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> suggested that this directive be followed up with
                        letters to Treasury, Agriculture, State, and other departments with
                        personnel overseas. The President expressed his belief in the primary
                        responsibility of the Ambassador in each country, but would agree to having
                        letters also sent to each department.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that the
                        impact of this directive might be lessened if it is pointed out that our
                        actual balance of trade in the world is still satisfactory. This is a
                        measure which applies to areas of activity in which the U.S. can act
                        unilaterally. The United States is the country which stations forces
                        overseas, which runs PXs and commissaries overseas, and which indulges in
                        the extension of soft loans. These things should be pointed out. The
                        President agreed and said we should emphasize that these actions are being
                        done completely within the purview of the President himself and apply to
                        activities where the U.S. acts uniquely.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> again expressed his
                        worry over the President’s personal position. Should this directive turn out
                        to create a major issue, Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> will consider the issue a great advantage to
                        himself. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> compared this
                        situation to the bank holiday of 1933 and said the Democrats could ride this
                        white horse for the next twenty years. They will point out how Democrats had
                        had to straighten out the errors of this Administration. The President said
                        perhaps they are <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0170"/>correct. Perhaps
                        we should have faced up to this matter a year earlier. We are, however,
                        going along with the least of the evils. We can’t afford to let our monetary
                        system break down before Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        is even sworn in. He told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> to discuss the balance of payments problem on his
                        visit to Europe, particularly with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
                            Gaulle</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he would, and said
                        he would ask <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> for $650,000,000
                        a year as payment for keeping our troops on their soil. Drastic action is
                        necessary there. If we undergo another six months comparable to the last
                        six, our gold cover will run out. We are down to almost $18 billion now and
                        speculation in banking circles is that we will devalue the dollar once our
                        gold reserve reaches $17 billion. This, of course, we will not do.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that this problem should not be new to the American
                        people. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had gone
                        on TV and the President himself had mentioned it in a speech. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> recommended that we get
                        the word to the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        Administration as soon as possible. We can talk to Clark Clifford<note n="5"

                            >Fulbright</persName> had offered to suggest to Senator <persName

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> recommended that
                        the document, having been very carefully worded, be allowed to speak for
                        itself without elaboration by any spokesman. Mr.
                            <persName>Hagerty</persName> said the document has to speak for itself
                        because few people understand it.</p>
                    <p>The discussion then turned to the Soviet action on the value of the ruble.
                        Its value on the world market is actually $0.25. This, however, is reduced
                        to $0.10 for persons travelling within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> to encourage the spending of foreign exchange in that
                        country. On paper, the Soviets <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0171"
                        />recently raised the ruble by a factor of 10 to make it $2.50. Yesterday
                        they reduced this on paper to $1.10. Apparently the purpose of this last
                        figure is to maintain Soviet prestige by carrying the ruble as slightly more
                        valuable than the dollar. This does not affect Soviet foreign trade, since
                        for those purposes the ruble is valued at current market prices.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then recommended
                        that any questions on details of the Presidential directive be directed
                        toward the Treasury Department rather than toward the White House. Mr.

                    <p>On November 16, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                        issued a directive on steps to be taken to improve the U.S. balance of
                        payments. The directive declared it “imperative” that the United States
                        “give the very highest priority to attaining a reasonable equilibrium in its
                        international balance of payments.” It outlined steps to be taken or
                        intensified with respect to international trade, international finance, and
                        domestic economic policy, and it directed the heads of various agencies to
                        take specific steps to reduce expenditures outside the United States. Those
                        steps included reduction of the number of dependents of military and
                        civilian personnel abroad, reduction of overseas procurement, and a
                        requirement that both the International Cooperation Administration <pb

                        primary emphasis on financing goods and services of U.S. origin. For text,

                        <item>The Managing Director continues to feel that the Special Reserve of
                            the Fund should be built up substantially and he is not satisfied that
                            the present investment of $500 million is achieving this objective at a
                            sufficiently rapid rate. He argues that at a time when certain risks are
                            rising and when the Fund’s income is falling, the combined Special and
                            General Reserves should be increased as rapidly as practicable to as
                            much as $200 million. At the end of the last fiscal year, April 30,
                            1960, the Special Reserve amounted to $22.3 million and the General
                            Reserve to $39.8 million, or a total of $62 million. The proceeds from
                            investment in U.S. Treasury securities accrue to the Special Reserve,
                            and net earnings from operations are placed in the General

                    <p>The President opened the meeting by speaking of the highly distorted press
                        handling of the meeting at Bonn of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                            >Adenauer</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d61fn1"><persName
                                corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> visited Bonn, November 19–23.
                            Documentation on their trip, during which they also visited Paris and
                            London, is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 559, CF
                            1781–1788.</note> He said he knew the accounts of the meeting were
                        factually incorrect in their basic elements because they wrongly stated that
                        there had been no coordination between the Treasury and State Departments
                        and that the Germans had not been notified in advance. The facts are of
                        course quite different. The President also said that he had received a
                        letter from <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName><note n="2"
                            xml:id="d61fn2">Dated November 24. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.,
                            Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204)</note> in which <persName
                            corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had pressed for him to come to the
                        December <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting and had indicated
                        that a large measure of agreement had been reached in the talks—which seems
                        to be something of an exaggeration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then gave a report of the
                        mission. He and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had
                        arrived on Saturday and had met with Ambassador Dowling on Sunday. Dowling,
                        far from recommending a soft approach to the Germans, had recommended that
                        the matter be put to them with total bluntness. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that in fact he and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had softened one or two
                        points of the presentation when they met with the Germans from what had been
                        developed with Ambassador Dowling. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said they had met with the Chancellor on
                            Monday.<note n="3" xml:id="d61fn3">They met with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> on November 21 and 22. Brief
                            telegraphic summaries of both conversations are in Secun 1 and 3 from
                            Bonn, November 21 and 22; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Conference
                            Files: Lot 64 D 559, CF 1782. A memorandum of the second conversation is
                                <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., CF 1781.</note> They had outlined the
                        balance of payments situation to him and the problem of our gold outflow.
                        They had made clear the necessity for actions to defend the dollar and had
                        brought out that support costs in Germany represent a $600 million gold
                        burden to us. They had stressed that we cannot run a $4 billion deficit in
                        balance of payments annually. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said it was quite clear that the Chancellor did not
                        understand this problem at all well, in spite of repeated explanations. The
                        Chancellor’s own people confirmed this, and said that the matter is not one
                        for which he has an understanding. Again and again <pb n="143"
                            xml:id="pg_143" facs="0175"/>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                            >Adenauer</persName> came back to the point that there is only one thing
                        that worries him, and that is the possibility that we might redeploy some of
                        our troops. On this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> stated and reiterated that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> is resolved to do whatever the
                        United States has to do to protect the dollar.</p>
                    <p>After meeting with the Chancellor, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said the group met with German representatives.
                        These representatives suggested what the Germans would be willing to do.
                        They offered a $1 billion foreign aid program for the coming year. Notably,
                        this would include some grants and some soft loans—this is an advance over
                        any previous German statements. The Germans estimated that 20% of this
                        billion dollars could be expected to result in expenditures in the United
                        States. Second, the Germans offered a prepayment of the outstanding $800
                        million on the <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> account; however,
                        they conditioned this on the U.S. forgiving $200 million of this as an
                        off-set for the remaining vested German assets. Third, the Germans said they
                        might buy some military equipment in the United States. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he told them that this action
                        would help only if this were added to their budget. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that this is an important item,
                        and that Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"
                            >Irwin</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d61fn4">Assistant Secretary of
                            Defense for International Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"
                                >John N. Irwin, II</persName>.</note> is working with the Germans on
                        a plan for them to buy in the United States about $400 million worth of
                        military equipment a year which they would otherwise buy in Germany. The
                        Germans are talking about $250 million worth. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he thinks it would be
                        desirable for them not to go far beyond $300 million worth since they would
                        then claim that this makes up for refusal to pay support costs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said the Germans stressed
                        over and over that they do not want to do anything that would harm the
                        government in the election in later 1961, or add to the budget. The
                        President observed that anything supporting our troop costs sounds like
                        occupation charges to the Germans and is anathema to them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that in order to
                        remove the bad psychological effect he had suggested that the Germans and
                        the U.S. set up a military fund that would handle several kinds of things
                        and submerge the troop costs. They did not like this because they said it
                        would increase their budget. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said he told them that probably the only way to get
                        relief in the circumstances was to redeploy their troops. He also told them
                        that while he is not making the decisions he is certain that the President
                        will do anything necessary to protect the dollar.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that Chancellor
                            <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had told him that the
                        Germans simply could not possibly pay support costs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> added that a Bundestag member who
                        was recently in the United States had talked with President-elect <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, and quoted <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> as <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144"
                            facs="0176"/>saying that he would not ask the Germans to pay troop
                        costs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> observed that
                        anything the Germans really do they will want to do for the new
                        administration, so as to get maximum credit with them.</p>
                    <p>The President said that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had
                        been pressing him to come to Paris. His real purpose is clear—to get the
                        President to promise that the United States would not redeploy troops. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said we should not let
                        the Germans off the hook, that we may take our troops out. He said that Mr.
                            <persName>Blessing</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d61fn5">President of
                            the Bundesbank Karl Blessing.</note> had said the Chancellor simply does
                        not understand this issue but that the Chancellor very much wants to help us
                        and not hurt us. He said that Blessing added that the biggest consideration
                        is who is to be the next Secretary of the Treasury. Blessing even stated
                        that <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> could tell
                        President-elect <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> this. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> commented that
                            Baumgartner<note n="6" xml:id="d61fn6">French Finance Minister Wilfrid
                            S. Baumgartner.</note> in France and Cobbold<note n="7" xml:id="d61fn7"
                            >Governor of the Bank of England Lord Cobbold.</note> in the United
                        Kingdom said exactly the same thing. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said the Germans had asked him two or three times
                        why the United States had not prohibited the Ford transaction.<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d61fn8">On November 14, Ford Motor Company, Inc., announced an
                            offer to purchase all stock units which it did not already own in its
                            British subsidiary, Ford Motor Company, Ltd., for the sum of $358
                            million.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        commented that the Fords said that they had given deep consideration to the
                        adverse impact of their action but had decided to go ahead with it anyhow.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had gone so far as to
                        tell the Fords that their action might be the cause of imposition of
                        exchange controls. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said
                        he told Erhard that the only way to restrict the Fords would be to impose
                        exchange controls, and that Erhard was horrified at the thought. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that Cobbold had
                        told him the United Kingdom will not hold the dollars derived from the
                        transaction. They will use some in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>,
                        but the remainder, in the order of $180 million, they will immediately turn
                        in for gold in New York. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        commented that General Norstad had said it would be a long time before the
                        GIs buy a Ford again.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the press has
                        been carrying stories that Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> wants him to be his Secretary of the Treasury. The
                        President stated that <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had
                        told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> that he would like to
                        have <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName><note n="9" xml:id="d61fn9"><persName
                                corresp="#p_LHC1">Henry Cabot Lodge</persName> had been the
                            Republican vice presidential candidate.</note> in his administration,
                        but that they would not be given policy positions. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> seemed somewhat surprised at this.
                        The President went on to say that if <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> were offered the Secretaryship of the Treasury, in
                        his opinion he should take it at once and do everything in his power to
                        protect our currency. The President added that if <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> were to offer him the Secretaryship
                        of the Treasury, he would take it himself. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> reiterated that the <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145"
                            facs="0177"/>key thing seems to be the question of who his successor is
                        to be. Everyone in Europe is asking this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said that something tangible has already come out
                        of the Bonn discussions, in the German willingness to make soft loans, and
                        in their offer to buy additional military equipment. He thinks that we must
                        be prepared to wrestle with them over troop deployments.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if he was correct in thinking there is no substantial
                        dollar problem in Okinawa deployments, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said this is true. The President said what he had
                        in mind is to cut down on deployments in Japan and move the forces to
                        Okinawa.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that Germany and
                        Italy are the big problems. The President asked if we could scatter our
                        troops more and use the soft currencies generated in each country to pay
                        some of our expenses there. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said this is a good idea although it is hard to see
                        where this could be substantial. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said the other Europeans are watching this whole
                        situation closely to see that the Germans do not help us by shifting the
                        gold drain to them.</p>
                    <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he
                        would like to see the President go to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> conference in Paris in December and talk to the conference
                        on fiscal problems. He went on to say that in reporting his mission he
                        thought it was important to dispel two ideas the press had created—that the
                        talks had not been coordinated as between Treasury and State, and that we
                        had not made clear to the Germans (as in fact we had) that support costs
                        would be the central subject of the discussion. He also thought it should be
                        made clear that we did not brush aside the German suggestions. In fact, we
                        welcomed them but told them they did not give a full solution. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_PGWB1">Persons</persName> said the press is
                        carrying statements that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> wrongly views this problem as a long-range problem
                        whereas, as the Germans state, it is really quite temporary and transitory.
                        He thought this should be corrected.</p>
                    <p>The President thought that we might do well to build a backfire against the
                        propaganda the Germans are putting out. The danger is that we must not go so
                        far as to get a protectionist drive started. He would be quite ready to tell
                        the Germans and Italians that we may put a higher Buy American differential
                        back into effect.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that Cobbold
                        had told him he thought one possibility in the Ford action is that they are
                        doing this to get their money out of the United States in anticipation of
                        real trouble here. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        indicated skepticism over this, I asked him if he did not think this was
                        true. He said he did not. I volunteered the view that I did not see how it
                        could be anything else, and that the Europeans, who have a long experience
                        in this kind of thing, certainly recognize it is just that. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he was not sure on this score.
                        I stated that another reason is certainly to take advantage of lower labor
                            <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0178"/>costs and higher profit rates
                        abroad. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed with this.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_PGWB1">Persons</persName> asked whether
                        Defense is cutting down its procurement abroad. I told him this was called
                        for in the President’s directive. He asked specifically about purchases of
                        drugs in Italy and I said I would check this.</p>

                        Senator Johnson had asked what this administration recommended, and Mr.

                        was generally agreed and approved by the President. The President asked what

                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he is a very able and dedicated

                        he was forced to withdraw from consideration for Assistant Secretary of

                        agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s assessment
                        of Mr. <persName>Nitze</persName>’s capacities. He is very keen and able
                        although he does not have perhaps a personal “fly wheel” of a size
                        commensurate with his energy and intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that when Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> becomes President,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> will have the
                        only voice stronger than his in our country. He thought that the President
                        should say that all citizens should try to be a brake on Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> since he is dealing with the whole
                        world economic system. He again raised the question of the President going
                        to Paris.</p>
                    <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0179"/>
                    <p>The President said that if he did so he would have to take Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and that this would be impossible,
                        both for him and for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. If

                        them at Camp David, for example. He would not have to have Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> present at these discussions,
                        although they could of course see him separately.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that Ambassador
                        Dowling had told him it is not likely that <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                            >Adenauer</persName> will be the next Chancellor. His party will decline
                        in power. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he agreed
                        and thought that a coalition is inevitable, and that <persName
                            corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> would not be its

                    <p>I pointed out to Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> that
                        he would be the first President in the history of the United States who, at
                        the very beginning of his term and possibly throughout his term of office,
                        would face the problem of deficits in our balance of payments of such
                        magnitude and under such new conditions as would require judgments and
                        considerations that were essentially unique to American Administrations.</p>
                    <p>The deficit in our balance of payments was not an issue in the previous
                        political campaign and was little more than a passing issue in the current
                        Presidential campaign. Consciousness of the American <pb n="148"
                            xml:id="pg_148" facs="0180"/>people and, to a large extent, those of
                        other countries became focused upon the imbalance of international payments
                        as a result of the steep rise in the price of gold on the London market in
                        October of 1960. This, of course, was merely an evidence or a symptom of
                        what had occurred and what was occurring.</p>
                    <p>The problem, in order to be brought into perspective, must be analyzed from
                        the standpoint of changing conditions from 1957 through 1960. In the period
                        of 1957 and 1958, productive capacity of Western Europe and Japan became
                        completed. They achieved external convertibility in their currency and they
                        began to sell competitively throughout the world. The United States which
                        prior to that time had been the principal supplier of goods because of the
                        inability of others to compete found itself suddenly in a highly competitive
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Prior to the 1957–58 era and subsequent to the end of the war in 1945, the
                        United States had not only supplied large sums of money in the form of
                        grants, loans, and other types of help, but had encouraged overseas
                        investment and had allowed other countries to erect barriers against trade
                        with the dollar area. When the competitive position was restored, the
                        restraints against trade with the dollar area, for the large part,
                        continued. As a result of these and other circumstances, the United States
                        began to run large deficits in its balance of payments in 1958, amounting in
                        that year to $3.4 billion; in 1959, to $3.8 billion; and in 1960, it
                        appeared that the deficit would be within the range of $3.5 billion. These
                        dollars, whether distributed directly to industrialized countries or to the
                        developing countries, tended to accumulate in the hands of the
                        industrialized countries of Western Europe and Japan. For the most part,
                        these countries had achieved their traditional and historical balance
                        between the holding of gold and foreign exchange as a part of their own
                        reserves. As a consequence, dollars which now continue to accumulate in the
                        hands of such countries might very well be expected to be cashed in against
                        the limited gold reserves of the United States.</p>
                    <p>We therefore had to regard expenditures in our budget if made in the United
                        States as the expenditure of an ordinary dollar, but if transferred abroad,
                        very likely to be in terms of a gold dollar.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out that while growth and economic development in this country
                        were both desirable and essential, a rise in <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                            >GNP</gloss> with no substantial increase in our gold stocks and with
                        continuing deficits could still supply the elements of a lack of confidence
                        in the international financial system which if allowed to reach unmanageable
                        proportions could bring about serious problems of national and international
                        deflation.</p>
                    <p>As a part of the problem of confidence, consideration must be given to both
                        external and internal financial problems of the Government. Externally, we
                        must seek to achieve a reasonable balance in our <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149"
                            facs="0181"/>payments position with reference to other countries, we
                        must insist that discriminations which were once tolerated against trade
                        with this country be removed, and we must carefully examine our commitments
                        which result in an outflow of dollars that will be accumulated in the hands
                        of other strong industrial countries.</p>
                    <p>Of equal importance in the maintenance of confidence is the way in which we
                        manage our internal affairs so as to avoid undue inflationary pressures.
                        This means that strong efforts must be made to pay for our various
                        governmental programs out of current earnings at times when levels of
                        business activity are reasonably high. While a balanced budget is not
                        indispensable and should be evaluated in the light of existing economic
                        circumstances, a continuing effort should be made to achieve balance and to
                        avoid large deficits; and over a period of a business cycle, efforts should
                        be made to achieve a surplus position in excess of any deficits that may
                        have occurred. Such surpluses should be used to retire portions of the
                        national debt.</p>
                    <p>The way in which we manage the national debt is not only of importance to our
                        citizenship in this country but is carefully examined by others who hold
                        dollar claims against us. Such holders of dollar claims are vitally
                        concerned with the maturity structure of the debt, the avoidance of a
                        continual shortening of the marketable debt, and the freedom of the Treasury
                        to operate freely in the market without statutory restraints.</p>
                    <p>It was further pointed out that I had reviewed these problems not only with
                        members of this Administration and with Committees in the Congress and
                        Congressional leaders but even with people who had come to be advisers to
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, for more than two
                        years; that while there had been a general understanding of the problem and
                        a belief that something should be done, the attitude had been generally to
                        avoid taking any steps at a given time and to postpone the making of any
                        decisions in this field other than the generally agreed desirability of
                        increasing our exports.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out to Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        that over the past two years strenuous efforts had been made to persuade
                        other countries to remove their restraints against trade with the dollar
                        area. Substantial progress had been made; much more needed to be done.</p>
                    <p>It was emphasized that in our efforts to bring our balance of payments into
                        more reasonable equilibrium, we should try to avoid actions that would
                        lessen or hamper the development of international trade and the continuing
                        progress of the developing countries of the world. This meant that serious
                        choices had to be made. Nothing which affected our balance of payments
                        should be considered sacrosanct; nor should any course of action be
                        permitted to achieve a new attractiveness simply because it is easy.</p>

                    <p>The acceleration in the gold price on the free market in London since October
                        1960 and the movement of gold out of the country during the last half of
                        1960 were carefully reviewed. It was pointed out that this movement began in
                        serious proportions in July 1960 and had continued in varying degrees since
                        that time. Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was told
                        that during a meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in
                        September 1960 the United States Government had expressed to the Chancellor
                        of the Exchequer the strong belief that the price of gold should not be
                        allowed to fluctuate substantially above the parity price of $35 an ounce;
                        that some central banks, notably the Bank of Italy, had been securing their
                        requirements of gold in the London free market, thereby exerting pressure on
                        demand in that market. It was suggested that both the British and the United
                        States should indicate to the Governor of the Bank of Italy that the
                        requirements of the central bank of Italy could be more appropriately met by
                        the Bank of Italy buying directly from the United States in the normal
                        course.</p>
                    <p>After the rise of the gold price in London, there were some statements to the
                        effect that the British had not been certain as to whether or not gold
                        supplied to the free market in London by the Bank of England could be
                        replenished by purchases from the United States. I described to Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> a meeting with the Deputy
                        Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. <persName>Parsons</persName>, which
                        resulted in a statement by the United States authorities that we did not
                        object to the way in which the Bank of England was buying and selling gold
                        in the London free market and that we had told Governor Parsons that we
                        would expect if this practice was followed in the future, that the United
                        Kingdom would be buying some gold from us. We stated that the London free
                        market was their market and should be operated by them, but that we should
                        be in daily communication, or hourly communication if necessary, in order to
                        avoid widespread swings in the price for which gold was sold in London.
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was advised that this
                        arrangement was now working satisfactorily and that we hoped we could avoid
                        situations which would so accelerate demand as to increase the complexity of
                        the problem.</p>
                    <p>It was suggested that a number of plans had been put forward concerning the
                        International Monetary Fund and other efforts of international cooperation.
                        While none of these ideas should be discarded or cast aside, they should be
                        reviewed carefully for both current and future implications. They should be
                        evaluated in the light of whether or not they went to the basic problem of
                        imbalance in our international accounts or whether they simply were
                        temporary expedients to postpone the issue or were aimed primarily at
                        additional international liquidity rather than the settlement of
                        imbalances.</p>
                    <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0183"/>
                    <p>I pointed out that we had carefully reviewed with Mr.
                            <persName>Paul</persName> Nitze our recent trip to Germany and had made
                        clear to him that while not asking the advice of Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> with reference to our proposals,
                        any counsel or advice he wished to give would be most welcome and would be
                        taken into account.</p>
                    <p>On our return from Germany, we reviewed again with Mr.
                            <persName>Nitze</persName> the details of our meetings in Germany,
                        France, and Great Britain, and particularly pointed out those portions of
                        our mission which were not accurately reported in press statements. On this
                        occasion, we made clear that any suggestions from Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> or his associates would be
                        welcome.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said that he
                        understood the difficulty of the tasks involved in our European trip and
                        that it certainly would make his efforts in dealing with our international
                        imbalances “an easier one.” There were reviewed a number of possible
                        measures which might be considered in trying to bring our balance of
                        payments into more reasonable equilibrium with an analysis of both the good
                        points and difficulties involved in each course of procedure.</p>
                    <p>The Senator was informed that long hours of study had gone into all phases of
                        this problem in the Treasury and with other agencies of the Government and
                        that these studies both in the form of memoranda and in oral consultations
                        would be made fully available to him and to his associates. It was suggested
                        that both before and after he assumed the responsibilities of the Presidency
                        those of us who had worked closely with the problem would be available for
                        such consultation as he might require.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> thanked me for the
                        review and stated that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> had already given him a substantial review of his
                        own analysis of the problem. He stated that he recognized that it was one of
                        the important problems with which he would be confronted; that he was
                        appreciative of the efforts which had been made for achieving a correction
                        of the international imbalances thus far and that he was sure that his own
                        efforts would be assisted greatly by the work which already had been
                        done.</p>
                    <p>This memorandum was dictated by Secretary of the Treasury <persName

                    <p>In his State of the Union address, given before a joint session of the
                        Congress on January 9, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> proposed extending the Trade Agreements Act with
                        broadened negotiating authority for 5 years. For text of the address, see
                            <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1958,</hi>
                        pages 1–12. The Trade Agreements Act is Section 350 of the Tariff Act of
                        1930, amended by P.L. 316, June 12, 1934. (48 Stat. 943) For text of the

                    <p>The President elaborated on his suggestion in a January 13 message
                        transmitting his fiscal year 1959 budget recommendations to the Congress. He
                        also proposed that Titles I and II of the Agricultural Trade Development and
                        Assistance Act of 1954 be extended for one year, and that authorization for
                        sales of surplus agricultural commodities for foreign currencies be
                        increased from $4 to $5.5 billion. For text of his statement, see <hi

                    <p>These proposals were discussed at the January 17 Cabinet meeting. Secretary
                        of Agriculture <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Ezra Taft Benson</persName>
                        “noted the emphasis being put on the value of agricultural exports in
                        connection with legislation to extend the Reciprocal Trade Act.” Regarding
                        the reciprocal trade legislation, Secretary of Commerce Sinclair Weeks
                        “reported on the prospects of Congressional action on this, emphasizing the
                        probable difficulty of getting agreement on five years as the term of
                        extension. The Cabinet discussed at considerable length the possibility of
                        increased public support for this program, especially through religious
                        organizations, the League of Women Voters, exporters, etc. Sec. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted the two-fold appeal that
                        probably had to be made as regards the dollars and cents value to the
                        American economy and also the non-militaristic value of international
                        cooperation, etc. He cautioned again about the economic warfare potential of
                        the Soviet Union and the advantage that Russia would have if our Reciprocal
                        Trade legislation should be emasculated.” (Minutes of Cabinet meeting;

                    <p>Eisenhower again stressed the importance of the trade agreements program in
                        the Economic Report of the President, transmitted to the Congress on January
                        20. He reiterated his request for a 5-year extension of the Trade Agreements
                        Act, terming it “the keystone of our foreign trade policy,” and asked for
                        authority to reduce U.S. tariffs up to 25 percent over the next 5 years to
                        conduct trade negotiations. He also suggested that Congress authorize U.S.
                        membership in the Organization for Trade Cooperation, which oversaw and
                        administered the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> agreement between
                        sessions.</p>
                    <p>The President also recommended the following measures relating to other
                        aspects of U.S. foreign trade: extension of the Export Control Act,
                        amendment of certain provisions pertaining to customs administration of the
                        Tariff Act of 1930, and additions to the Antidumping Act of 1921. Excerpts

                    <p>On January 30, Eisenhower sent the Congress a special message formally asking
                        for extension of the reciprocal trade agreements program and outlining the
                        arguments in favor of his request. For text of his statement, see <hi

                    <p>On March 20, the Senate adopted S. 3420, which extended P.L. 480 for 2 years

                    <p>On May 21, in a speech before the Foreign Policy Association at New York,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented again on the

                        Committee reported the legislation, H.R. 12591. Although it did not grant
                        all of the administration’s requests, H.R. 12591 extended the Trade
                        Agreements Act for 5 years and authorized the President to reduce tariffs as
                        much as 25 percent below current levels during this period. For text of H.R.
                        12591, see H. Rept. 1716, Eighty-fifth Congress, Second Session. In a May 22
                        letter to the President, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Mills
                        expressed his pleasure “that the bill as reported has your complete
                        approval.” He also directed Eisenhower’s attention to a provision that
                        empowered the Congress to override the President’s veto of Tariff Commission
                        recommendations on escape clauses and requested the President’s comments on
                        it. For text of the letter, see Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bulletin,</hi> July 21, 1958, pages 133–134.</p>
                    <p>Eisenhower’s May 29 reply stated the Attorney General had advised him the
                        provision in question was unconstitutional. Further, tariff policy could
                        have profound effects on free world security, while escape clause actions
                        could affect national interests. The President wrote: <quote

                            <p>“To withdraw from the President his power to make decisions in escape

                                findings and recommendations would in my opinion be a tragic blunder
                                which could seriously jeopardize the national interest, the foreign

                    </list>
                    <p>Ambassador Asakais said that in his belief perhaps the most important
                        problems in United States-Japanese relations were those related to trade
                        between the two countries and he had requested this opportunity to discuss
                        certain pending trade problems with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that since textiles was one of the most important
                        Japanese exports to the United States this subject has become a political as
                        well as an economic question and one to which the Japanese Government must
                        give continuing attention. Making reference to the Japanese cotton textile
                        export program, the Ambassador said that in 1956 his Government had pressed
                        the Japanese industry to accept restrictions on its exports, especially on
                        ginghams and corduroys (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>). [<hi rend="italic"
                            >Note:</hi> The Ambassador was undoubtedly referring to
                            velveteens.]<note n="1" xml:id="d69fn1">Brackets in the source
                            text.</note> He said that the Japanese had thought that during the
                        review of the program, which began in late 1957, they might negotiate some
                        increase on those items. At the same time, he said, they realized the
                        difficulties on the United States side and held their requests for changes
                        in the program to the minimum, presenting only proposals which they
                        considered to be quite reasonable. However, after exchanges of views by
                        representatives of both sides, an agreement had not yet been reached and the
                        discussions remained in deadlock. The Ambassador said that he had been
                        concerned about the situation and he strongly believed that it would not be
                        good for relations between the two countries to carry on these discussions
                        further without hope of reaching a compromise. Therefore, he had personally
                        recommended to his Government that the review be postponed until some time
                        in the fall when the climate in the United States for possible adjustment
                        might be more favorable. Meanwhile, he suggested that the Japanese program
                        revert to the status quo ante, except for two small items: <pb n="163"
                            xml:id="pg_163" facs="0195"/>1) the technical change in the measurement
                        of the table damask quota from denomination in dollars to denomination in
                        quantity; 2) the exclusion from the program of the Japanese-type items.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that he quite
                        agreed with the Ambassador that if the discussions were indeed in deadlock
                        it would be desirable to postpone them until later in the year. He said that
                        since he was not familiar with the details of the program or of the
                        discussions, he could not respond directly with respect to the two items
                        mentioned by the Ambassador. However, he said that immediate consideration
                        would be given to the Ambassador’s suggestions in an effort to respond as
                        quickly as possible.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador referred to the proposed Payne Amendment to the Mutual
                        Security Act, now pending before the Congress, which is designed
                        specifically to limit the amount of offshore procurement with Mutual
                        Security funds.<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">This amendment was incorporated
                            in the bill reported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May
                            26; see <ref target="#d75">Document 75</ref>.</note> He pointed out that
                        if the proposed limit of 50 percent were applied item by item rather than
                        overall, it would be a serious blow to Japan which depends greatly upon
                        procurement under the Mutual Security Program to close its dollar payments
                        gap.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that he could not
                        respond on this matter at this time since the Amendment is now in debate on
                        the floor of the Senate. He said that the Payne Amendment was originally
                        intended to limit such offshore procurement to 50 percent overall, but that
                        certain elements may be trying to apply the 50 percent limitation item by
                        item. Should the Amendment carry in either form, he pointed out, the bill
                        would go to conference and the Executive Branch would have an opportunity to
                        comment upon it. He could assure the Ambassador, however, that the Executive
                        Branch does not favor the limitation in either form since it believes that
                        offshore procurement does not greatly affect the domestic economy because it
                        is so small, whereas it means a great deal abroad, and in any event the
                        dollars expended come back to the United States in the form of payments for
                        purchases from the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then referred to the general concern in Japan over restrictive
                        movements on the part of certain members of Congress and others against
                        Japanese imports. He said that these movements are widely reported in the
                        Japanese press. He pointed out that the Japanese Government is under
                        constant pressure to increase trade with China and that, although the
                        Japanese realize that the Communist Chinese mix trade with politics, this
                        question was invariably associated in the Japanese press with restrictive
                        movements in the United States against Japanese imports. He referred
                        specifically to the King <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0196"/>Bill, now
                        pending before Congress, regarding tuna imports.<note n="3" xml:id="d69fn3"
                            >Not further identified.</note> He said that it was rumored that the
                        Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act had been “bartered” with the tuna situation
                        and that restrictions on tuna imports would be granted in exchange for
                        support of the Trade Agreement Act. He pointed out that Japanese tuna
                        exports to the United States amounted to $35 million. He said that tuna is
                        typical of Japan’s efforts toward orderly marketing of its exports to the
                        United States. The Japanese had imposed floor prices and quotas on tuna
                        exports. They had tried to contribute money to a common advertising campaign
                        with the United States industry but this had not been successful. He said
                        that the United States tuna market was a growing one and therefore important
                        to Japan, and that it was for this reason that the Japanese had carried out
                        an orderly marketing program in this field in order to “live and let live.”
                        He said that the imposition of such a control program was designed primarily
                        to avoid the necessity for United States trade restrictions but that it
                        would be extremely difficult for the Japanese to understand the imposition
                        of trade restrictions even after they had conducted a strict program of

                            >Dillon</persName>’s inquiry, the Ambassador pointed out that the King
                        Bill would establish United States import quotas on tuna as well as large
                        increases in import duties.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> responded that, as the
                        Ambassador knew, the Executive Branch was opposed to import quotas and to
                        increased duties. He said that he would look into this matter.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador continued that the President’s acceptance of the Tariff
                        Commission’s recommendation for a 100 percent increase in the import duties

                        by the Japanese Government as necessary in the campaign to obtain approval
                        of the Trade Agreements Act. Although the imports amount to only a few
                        hundred thousand dollars, and might be considered, therefore, as
                        insignificant, the increased duty would drastically affect the Japanese
                        industry itself. He referred also to the bill recently passed by both Houses
                        of the Congress changing the definition of rubber-soled shoes<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d69fn5">P.L. 85–454, June 11, 1958; 72 Stat. 185.</note> and
                        pointed out that this, in effect, resulted in a large increase in the tariff
                        on such shoes. He also referred to the concern in Japan over the umbrella
                        frame case now pending before the Tariff Commission.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d69fn6">On March 12, the President asked the Tariff Commission

                        all of these items, the Ambassador stressed that while in each case the
                        imports were small they added up. These were the <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165"
                            facs="0197"/>products of small business in Japan and in each case the
                        industry involved was drastically affected. He pointed out that the owners
                        and workers of small businesses in Japan were among those who strongly
                        supported a conservative Japanese government and who were not Leftists, as
                        was the case of some of the workers in large industries in Japan. He thought
                        that this might not be fully understood in the United States and expressed
                        the belief that indications of continued movements toward restrictions on
                        these small items had a cumulative adverse political effect in Japan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the most
                        important thing for world trade and for Japanese and United States trade
                        agreement was of course the renewal of the Trade Agreements legislation,
                        which is now before the Congress. The Executive Branch is now concentrating
                        its efforts largely on obtaining passage of that legislation. If we are
                        successful, he said, it will be the result of an intensive effort on the
                        part of the President and all of the Departments of the Executive Branch,
                        and it will be much more to our mutual benefit than actions on thermometers
                        and various small items. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        said that he could understand, however, that an accumulation of actions on
                        these small items was of serious concern to the Japanese and he pointed out
                        in its efforts to obtain renewal of the Trade Agreement legislation, the
                        Executive Branch had Japan very much in its mind.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador closed his remarks on this general subject with the
                        observation that trade was the most difficult problem between the United
                        States and Japan. He said that questions such as those related to Okinawa
                        could be discussed between the two governments and he believed that such
                        discussions could result in mutually satisfactory conclusions. However, in
                        the case of tariffs, once a tariff had been increased, there would be no
                        further opportunity for discussion.</p>

                    <p>The House of Representatives began debate on the reciprocal trade legislation

                        Pennsylvania, H.R. 12676. Simpson’s bill extended the Trade Agreements Act
                        for 2 years instead of 5, denied the President the authority he had
                        requested to cut tariffs, empowered the Tariff Commission to establish the

                    <p>The United States has been a member of the 1949, 1953 and 1956 International
                        Wheat Agreements.<note n="1" xml:id="d71fn1">For text of the 1956
                            International Wheat Agreement, signed for the United States at
                            Washington May 18, 1956, and entered into force July 16, 1956 (Parts 1,
                            3–5), and August 1, 1956 (Part 2), see 7 <gloss target="#t_UST1"
                                >UST</gloss> 3275.</note> The current Agreement will expire July 31,
                        1959. At the session of the Wheat Council which convenes on June 25, 1958,
                        it is expected that a recommendation will be proposed calling for
                        arrangements for a conference to consider possibilities of renewal or
                        replacement and for the drafting of a proposed Agreement. If later a
                        conference is held and an Agreement formulated, the United States would be
                        free at that time to decide whether the terms were <pb n="167"
                            xml:id="pg_167" facs="0199"/>satisfactory and whether it wished to
                        adhere. However, a policy decision at this stage on United States
                        participation is necessary in order that any part which may be taken in
                        connection with the Wheat Council’s recommendation or in an international
                        conference may be in consonance with the policy, and in good faith.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Facts Bearing on the Problem</hi></p>
                    <p>It is estimated that the United States carryover of wheat on July 1, 1958,
                        will be around 900 million bushels and that, additionally, the oncoming crop
                        may total 1,200 million bushels. Annual domestic requirements are only 600
                        million bushels. The Wheat Agreement is not specifically a means for the
                        disposal of surpluses such as indicated, but it does function in the area of
                        international trade in wheat and it does have favorable implications in
                        connection with all wheat moving into world markets both inside and outside
                        the Wheat Agreement.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi></p>
                    <p>Since the United States can only compete in the world wheat market by means
                        of export subsidies, the International Wheat Agreement provides a convenient
                        framework within which our export subsidy program can be operated in an
                        atmosphere of international cooperation. In effect the Agreement gives
                        international acceptance and approval of our export subsidy program, for it
                        is operated to implement the provisions of an internationally agreed
                        marketing arrangement. This fact has important political implications, for
                        it removes an important area of our export trade from potential controversy.
                        Unilateral action by the United States would be a constant source of charges
                        that we were impairing the markets of others and depressing world wheat
                        prices. As our current arrangements have international sanction, the export
                        subsidy program is not a source of irritation among friendly competitors.
                        The International Wheat Agreement thus makes a positive contribution to our
                        foreign economic policy and good political relations.</p>
                    <p>Major exporting countries other than the United States market their wheat
                        through Government agencies, and also a few importing countries purchase
                        wheat in this manner. In addition, all countries exercise regulatory powers
                        over the importation and utilization of wheat. In the light of these direct
                        interests of governments in trade in wheat, there is ample opportunity in
                        Wheat Council contacts for fixing in the international consciousness the
                        position of the United States as a leading wheat and flour exporting
                        country, and for the furtherance of good will with customer countries.</p>
                    <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0200"/>
                    <p>Likewise, participation in international discussions on wheat matters on a
                        continuing basis has been very beneficial as related to relationships
                        generally with competing exporting countries. U.S. officials who are
                        concerned with the export marketing of wheat feel that these contacts assist
                        them in accurately appraising the U.S. competitive position in the world
                        market and in pulsing the competitive situation so as to better judge
                        probable reactions to U.S. competitive moves.</p>
                    <p>There is inherent in the Wheat Agreement a multilateral trade principle which
                        is desirable as a counterinfluence to bilateralism. This might prove to be
                        of greater importance now that a common market has been established in
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation</hi></p>
                    <p>It is recommended that the Council give approval in principle to the
                        continued participation of the United States in an International Wheat
                        Agreement, in the expectation that the United States would participate in
                        any negotiating conference which may be held, working toward a revised
                        Agreement which in the judgment of the Executive Departments concerned would
                        be in the best interests of the United States.<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2"

                        When he told the President he was here primarily to discuss the lead and
                        zinc problem<note n="1" xml:id="d72fn1">On April 24, the Tariff Commission
                            reported to the President that lead and zinc imports were damaging U.S.
                            producers. See <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current

                    <p>Curtis highly praised Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Thomas
                            Mann</persName> of the State Department for his “global plan”. He said
                        he thought this would result in much better relations between the United
                        States and foreign countries with whom we trade. He indicated his opposition
                        to the so called Seaton plan<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">A modified version
                            of this proposal by Secretary of the Interior <persName

                            Congress, Second Session.</note> providing subsidies for lead and zinc
                        producers.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated that he had an extremely tough decision to make and
                        that he considered the subsidy proposal only a temporary one until some
                        better and more permanent plan could be developed. Curtis went on then to
                        emphasize the fact that an increase in tariff was the best way to handle the
                        situation. He said he was talking from the premise that the lead and zinc
                        industries have been injured and that the Government wishes to do something
                        about it. He said that the tariff increase is the most liberal way to handle
                        the matter and that he opposes both quotas and licenses.</p>
                    <p>He emphasized the fact that the State Department doesn’t point out to other
                        countries that handling these matters through the tariff is the best and
                        most liberal way to do the job. He said that the use of subsidies might
                        serve to keep in business some of the smaller, more inefficient and high
                        cost producers, and at the same time make the big and efficient companies
                        more money that they are entitled to. The President then stated that the
                        pressures always come from the smaller and more inefficient producers. He
                        said that this was just as true in the lead and zinc industry as it is in
                        farming. He wants to know how many miners are actively engaged in mining
                        lead and zinc. I will get these figures from the Interior Department. The
                        President then pointed out as he has at many other meetings that with our
                        expanding population the prices of raw materials are bound to go up
                        eventually. He also stated that he didn’t believe that we could stockpile
                        too much in the way of minerals as someday our natural resources will be
                        exhausted and what we stockpile will be badly needed.</p>
                    <p>Congressman Curtis then indicated that one of the reasons for the State
                        Department’s opposition to tariff increases is the fact that it will hurt
                        our friendly trade nations. However, he stated that in lots of these
                        countries competitive products were produced through the use of American
                        capital employing native workers at extremely low wages. He said the
                        “capital take” sometimes runs higher than 30% as against 10% or 12% in this
                        country. He suggested the President have this looked into.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Since World War II the free world lead and zinc mining industry has
                        experienced several periods of distress as a result of overproduction and
                        abnormally low prices. The industry has again been in difficulty since May
                        1957 because of excess production and a price decline precipitated by the
                        curtailment in April 1957 of the United States barter program for these
                        metals. Domestic lead prices have declined 28% and domestic zinc prices 26%
                        since that time and prices abroad have declined even more.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Domestic Aspects</hi></p>
                    <p>United States imports of lead and zinc were negligible prior to 1940 but they
                        have exceeded domestic production for the last five years. Increased
                        competition from foreign producers, the gradual depletion of our higher
                        grade ores, rising costs of exploiting lower grade deposits and the
                        accumulation of large commercial stocks have all contributed to cause a
                        situation of genuine distress in the domestic industry.</p>
                    <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0203"/>
                    <p>In 1950, 1953 and again in 1957 the domestic industry sought protection from
                        the Tariff Commission under the Escape Clause. In 1954 and more recently in
                        1958 the Commission unanimously found that the domestic industry was being
                        injured by imports and recommended increased protection. Furthermore,
                        various bills have been introduced in Congress to provide for increased
                        protection against imports. Since lead and zinc are mined in some 20 states
                        and are especially important in 7 of them (Montana, Idaho, Utah, Missouri,
                        New York, Tennessee and Colorado), the possibility of increased tariffs or
                        quotas by act of Congress is already an ever-present possibility. Given the
                        competitive advantage which foreign producers of higher grade ores will
                        increasingly have in the future, it is at best doubtful that increased
                        tariffs or quotas for the domestic industry can be postponed indefinitely,
                        in the absence of alternative measures.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">International Aspects</hi></p>
                    <p>But a protectionist policy in regard to lead and zinc will have serious
                        consequences for our relations with Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Canada and
                        Australia, and to a lesser degree with five others (Belgium, Denmark, Italy,
                        Netherlands and Yugoslavia), all of whom have, in recent months, protested
                        against threatened higher United States tariffs or quotas. In varying
                        degrees additional restrictions on United States imports would create new
                        balance of payments and budgetary problems for them. A decision by the
                        United States Government to limit access to the American market by quotas
                        and/or increased tariffs would be interpreted by many of them as an effort
                        to export our unemployment and to insulate ourselves from the effects of
                        unfavorable world industry conditions, as a design to impede their economic
                        development and increase the disparities in international trade and national
                        productivity which already exist, and as inconsistent with our policy to
                        promote their economic development through United States private investment.
                        In Latin America the issue has emotional overtones to such an extent that
                        the position of American-owned lead and zinc mining companies would be
                        weakened and perhaps made the subject of nationalistic action. Furthermore,
                        the imposition of tariffs or quotas would make it necessary to compensate
                        for the withdrawal of the concession which has been made under <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> or permit retaliatory action to be
                        taken.</p>
                    <p>It was largely for these reasons that the Minerals Stabilization Plan, as an
                        alternative to increased tariffs or quotas, was supported by the Department
                        of State. However, several features of this program, especially the
                        revisions made in Senate Committee increasing the stabilization price levels
                        and consequently the amount of the payments, raise the question of whether
                        the Plan, as finally approved by Congress, will not restrict imports and
                        adversely affect world prices as <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0204"
                        />much as tariff action. In any case, it is certain that the Plan will not
                        be considered by friendly nations as a satisfactory long-term solution of
                        the problem.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the achievement of an approximate balance between supply and demand
                        at a price level fair to both producer and consumer in these two
                        commodities—the avoidance of booms and severe slumps in the industry—will
                        contribute to a steady expansion of world trade and to strengthening of free
                        world economic and political ties. Conversely, we shall be at a serious
                        disadvantage in the cold war if we show no interest and make no effort to
                        mitigate the impact of price swings in key commodities of considerable
                        importance to the economies of others. In speaking of the “Special Problem
                        of Primary Products” the recent “Rockefeller Report” on <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Economic Policy of the Twentieth Century</hi> makes the
                        following statement with which we concur: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“It is not surprising, then, to find an insistent demand on the part

                                Such demands have been increasing, as the recent downturn of the
                                terms of trade for primary products has created balance of payments
                                difficulties which seriously threaten the capacity to preserve
                                economic, and even political, stability.</p>

                                ability to discharge this responsibility.”</p>

                    <p>The Mexican, Peruvian and Australian Governments have already suggested the
                        need for a study of the feasibility of an international commodity
                        arrangement. Similarly, a unit of the United Nations, the Interim

                        and zinc and a meeting has been scheduled for September 1958. On the other
                        hand, the attitude of the Canadian Government, whose cooperation would be
                        essential to an effective international approach to the problem, is
                        uncertain.</p>

                        overcome in obtaining an agreement satisfactory to both producers and
                        consumers. On the other hand, a willingness on our part to explore
                        practicable possibilities would be of considerable psychological importance
                        to us and offers the best prospect of substituting multilateral for

                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> made an informal visit to
                        Canada, July 8–11. On July 9, Eisenhower addressed the Canadian Houses of
                        Parliament, speaking at length about U.S.-Canadian trade relations,
                        discussing U.S. surplus wheat disposal policies, imbalance in U.S.-Canadian
                        trade, and U.S. private investment in Canada. He also reassured his audience
                        that the United States would continue its reciprocal trade program. For text
                        of his statement, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of

                    <p>On July 15, the Senate Finance Committee reported the reciprocal trade
                        legislation, H.R. 12591. As reported by the Committee, H.R. 12591 extended
                        the Trade Agreements Act for 3 years and authorized tariff reductions of no
                        more than 5 percent each year. It also included a provision, added in an
                        amendment proposed by Senators Strom Thurmond and Robert S. Kerr, requiring
                        congressional approval if the President rejected Tariff Commission
                        recommendations to raise tariffs or impose quotas on imports. Should the

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> telephoned Under
                        Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> the
                        afternoon of July 22 to inquire about the bill’s progress on the Senate
                        floor. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said “he has not heard
                        recently but we got a good vote on striking out the Kerr amendment, and the
                        Sec said he saw that in the newspapers. The Sec said Adams stopped him and
                        gave him a confused story re the Payne amendment failing—going to conference
                        and could we get the concurrent vote of a majority. D does not think he has
                        been following it in detail. We always expected it would go to conf and we
                        would work it out there and we have a deal with Mills, LJohnson and
                            <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> to work it out. D does not
                        think anything has gone off the track. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> talked with LJohnson at 4 and said everything was
                        all right.” (Memorandum of telephone conversation; Eisenhower Library,

                    <p>The Payne amendment proposed enabling the Congress to override the
                        President’s veto of Tariff Commission recommendations with a majority vote
                        in both houses. The Senate passed H.R. 12591 with amendments the evening of
                        July 22; the Payne amendment, however, was defeated. Action on the
                        legislation then went into conference. See <ref target="#d77">Document
                            77</ref>.</p>
                    <p>On July 23, the House passed S. 3420 to extend the Agricultural Trade
                        Development and Assistance Act of 1954. Among its provisions, S. 3420
                        extended P.L. 480 for 1 year and increased the authorization for foreign
                        currency sales to $5.5 billion. Action on the bill then went into
                        conference. See <ref target="#d78">Document 78</ref>.</p>

                    <p>Although the session of Congress beginning January 1959 is probably the most

                        of the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> Agreement, there are several

                            <item>It may be difficult to continue to argue convincingly that the

                                symbolic value as an indication of U.S. leadership has greatly

                    <p>It will be necessary to reassess the Administration’s position of support for
                        the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> in the light of these and other
                        factors, including the composition of the new Congress. Meanwhile, however,
                        it is highly desirable for the United States to be able to seek and give
                        active support to other means of achieving the essential objectives of the
                            <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>, i.e., strengthening of the
                        operation of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and placing U.S.
                        acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> on a firm and
                        permanent basis.</p>
                    <p>The major weakness in the present operation of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> is its unwieldiness through lack of a continuing
                        organization and the current practice of conducting its main business
                        through a single annual session of the Contracting Parties. But this
                        weakness could be very substantially overcome by increasing the frequency of
                        meetings: say, quarterly working-level meetings to dispatch current business
                        and a brief (two weeks) annual session with high-level (Ministerial)
                        representation to deal with major problems and policy issues. This plan
                        would undoubtedly involve some strengthening of the permanent representation
                        of Contracting Parties in Geneva, but the additional cost would be small.
                        For example, smaller or poorer countries could use members of their missions
                        at nearby posts for most of this expanded program. The United States should
                        propose or support such a plan and be prepared to strengthen its own <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> representation as may be required.</p>
                    <p>A second major step would be U.S. definitive acceptance and application of
                        the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, which in itself would have a
                        significant strengthening effect in placing U.S. support of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> on a firm and permanent basis. Indeed,
                        such an act of positive U.S. leadership would probably go far to offset any
                        adverse repercussions abroad of a possible change of Administration policy
                        regarding the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>. Maximum impact would be
                        obtained by announcing U.S. definitive acceptance of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> at the 13th Session, preferably in a
                        speech at the meeting of Ministers.</p>
                    <p>The principal effects of definitive application of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> would be the change in formal status of
                        application and the requirement of six months’ written notice of withdrawal,
                        as compared with the sixty days’ written notice in the present situation of
                        provisional application. In addition, definitive acceptance would have to be
                        accompanied by a reservation to the effect that Part II of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> would be applied to the fullest extent
                        not inconsistent with legislation in existence on the date of provisional
                        accession (October 30, 1947). There would also be an annual review by the
                        Contracting Parties of the extent to which such inconsistencies might have
                        been eliminated, although there would be neither obligation nor commitment
                        to eliminate inconsistencies.</p>

                    <p>The White House announced on September 22 that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had decided to restrict lead and
                        zinc imports into the United States. In identical letters to Senate Finance
                        Committee Chairman Byrd and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Mills,
                        the President explained, “I recognize that the imposition of quotas is an
                        unusual step, but it is better suited than a tariff increase to the unique
                        circumstances of the case and more likely to lead to enduring solutions
                        beneficial to the entire lead and zinc industry.”</p>

                    <p>Foreign reaction to the U.S. announcement was generally negative,

                        STUDY GROUP</p>
                    <p>The Delegation should make clear at the beginning of the meeting and as often
                        thereafter as may be necessary to prevent misunderstanding that the United
                        States considers that the discussions are exploratory and that U.S.
                        participation therein does not imply any commitment on its part to support
                        any particular formula or to participate in an international commodity
                        agreement for lead and zinc. In this connection, the Delegation should make
                        clear that any proposals made during the exploratory discussions would in
                        any case, as far as the United States is concerned, have to be submitted to
                        the appropriate policy making officials (Council on Foreign Economic Policy)
                        for consideration on their merits.</p>
                    <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0218"/>
                    <p>The Delegation should suggest that a better balance in world production and
                        consumption of lead and zinc is desirable and might best be achieved during
                        the next year or so by undertaking among exporting countries, in
                        consultation with importing countries, to reduce the level of exports of
                        lead and zinc and the ores of these metals. If this type of arrangement is
                        unacceptable to other countries, the Delegation may, subject to the
                        instructions set out in the preceding paragraph discuss such alternative
                        proposals for correcting the present imbalance between the supply and demand
                        as may be made by others.</p>
                    <p>The United States Delegation should not participate in the drafting of any
                        commodity agreement nor should it present any drafts of its own. If a draft
                        or drafts should be presented by others, the Delegation may discuss it
                        provided it is made clear that discussion is not to be interpreted as United
                        States approval.</p>
                    <p>Should the discussions reveal majority sentiment in favor of the
                        establishment of a study group under the aegis of the United Nations to
                        facilitate international discussion of the problem of international trade in
                        lead and zinc, the United States Delegation may vote in favor of the
                        establishment of such a group, provided it makes clear that the United
                        States Government reserves the right to withdraw from the study group
                        whenever in the judgment of this Government the study group has ceased to
                        serve a useful purpose.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the discussions, other Delegations may inquire as to the
                        interpretation placed by the United States on the references which have been
                        made to an “equitable sharing of the burden of readjustment”. In reply to
                        any such inquiries, the Delegation should state that the concept behind
                        those reference is that the lead and zinc mining industry in this country
                        reduced production by about 25 per cent in early 1958 in an effort to remedy
                        the imbalance. Furthermore, the United States considers that the import
                        quotas already constitute an equitable sharing of the burden.</p>
                    <p>Other Delegations may inquire whether the United States is in principle
                        prepared at this time to increase the level of permissible imports of lead
                        and zinc into this country. The Delegation should respond to any such
                        inquiries in the negative, pointing out that any increased imports into the
                        United States market at this time would result in price declines which would
                        serve neither the interests of the United States industry nor the interests
                        of the foreign suppliers in this market. At the same time, the Delegation
                        should make clear that in the judgment of the United States any multilateral
                        arrangement should have as its objective an appropriate balance between the
                        supply and demand in all markets and therefore any such arrangement should
                        have the flexibility needed to adjust to changed conditions.</p>

                    <p>The Delegation should make clear, if the question arises, that the United
                        States is not prepared to contribute to any buffer stock arrangement.</p>

                        that negotiations beginning in mid-1960 would fit in with the need for the
                        six member countries of the European Economic Community to adjust their
                        existing tariff concessions before taking their first step on January 1,
                        1962 toward establishing a common external tariff. Negotiations at that time
                        would also make possible optimum utilization of the authority granted by the
                        Congress in the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1958.<note n="2"

                        Community was, in fact, one of the principal points advanced by the
                        Executive Branch in support of extension of the trade agreements
                        authority.</p>
                    <p>The new round of tariff negotiations is certain to be extraordinarily
                        technical and difficult in view of the complexities resulting from the
                        development of the common external tariff. Preparations for the negotiations
                        are correspondingly complex and time-consuming, and should be given high
                        priority by all Government agencies concerned. I suggest that you mention
                        this matter at an early meeting of the Cabinet with a view to encouraging
                        members whose departments have responsibilities in this field to issue
                        appropriate instructions to their staffs to proceed with the necessary

                        <p>On signing the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1958, on August 20 of
                            this year, I said, “. . .<note n="6" xml:id="d86fn6">Ellipsis in the
                                source text.</note> the free nations are now assured of a continuity
                            in United States trade policy that will make possible new international
                            negotiations to promote mutually advantageous commercial exchange and
                            increased world productivity.”</p>
                        <p>In such negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade we
                            will be faced with unprecedented complexities arising out of the tariff
                            changes which are an integral part of the newly created European
                            Economic Community. As a consequence, the project of preparing for and
                            conducting the negotiations is an enormous one which presents a
                            challenge to every agency of the executive branch concerned with the
                            trade agreements program. It is vital that this project be promptly and
                            carefully planned, vigorously pushed forward, and successfully
                            concluded. This result can be achieved only with the full cooperation of
                            every agency having responsibilities in the trade agreements field.</p>
                        <p>Under the 1958 Extension Act, authority to enter into trade agreements
                            expires on June 30, 1962. In view of the evident complexities, even to
                            meet this date would require immediate initiation of preparatory steps
                            and diligent attention to every phase of the work. It must be our aim,
                            however, to complete the negotiations and enter into trade agreements
                            well in advance of June 30, 1962 in order that the results of our
                            important negotiations with the European Economic Community can be made
                            effective by January 1, 1962 when the common external tariff of the

                    <p>On January 14, 1959, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        described for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the three basic
                        purposes underlying U.S. foreign policy. Regarding economic progress, he
                        mentioned other industrialized states’ contribution to international
                        economic development, then concluded: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“In the years ahead we must, through our trade and financial
                                policies, continue to promote recognition and positive use of the
                                benefits of interdependence. These benefits and the inevitability of
                                economic interdependence become more clear each year. What is being
                                done in the European Community of Six provides an example and an
                                inspiration for greater economic cooperation elsewhere in the

                        foreign policy, he described trade as “the basic instrument” for countering
                        the Soviet economic offensive. The text of his statement is <hi

                        submitted its report on combating the Soviet economic offensive to President

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Foster</hi>: We have such a multitude of things to
                        deal with that it is very difficult to keep track of them or to deal with
                        them all on a personal basis between us. I think, however, that you should
                        personally know how very much worried Harold and I are about the decision to
                        reject the British bid to supply two turbines for the Greers’ Ferry Dam
                        project in Arkansas. I hope you will forgive me if I put to you quite
                        frankly what is in our minds.</p>
                    <p>Surely it is all wrong to offer a contract to tender when the whole
                        transaction is later made into a farce. While no doubt the decision was made
                        in good faith, the British public really cannot be expected to believe that
                        the whole security of the United States might be imperilled by the purchase
                        of two turbines from an ally like the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>If this were an isolated matter I would not trouble you with a message.
                        Indeed in many ways 1958 has been a good year for economic co-operation
                        between us particularly over world issues such as increasing the resources
                        of the Bank and Fund. Also the United States continues to be a great and
                        growing market for British goods. But there have been a disquieting number
                        of cases involving the interest specifically of the United Kingdom, where
                        United States action can only seem to us to be something of a retreat from
                        interdependence. For instance, the adverse discriminatory effect of the
                        United States wool tariff quota on United Kingdom exports has become
                        increasingly evident. The United States proposal to make available nuclear
                        fuel for United States export reactors on terms likely to prejudice the
                        development of normal trade is bound to hurt us more than anyone else.</p>
                    <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0225"/>
                    <p>There is also the continued indifference of the United States Defense
                        Department to offers of British aircraft engines, despite the world standing
                        of the latter, and even when the available British types have no United
                        States competitor.</p>
                    <p>I would like to think that you would look at this situation in the
                        perspective I have set out. These things may seem small, measured against
                        the United States economy as a whole, but for Britain, which lives by trade,
                        such things as these hit us at our most sensitive point.</p>
                    <p>I do not want to exaggerate the importance of this one decision. I hope very
                        much it is not going to be an unfortunate precedent but we have worked so
                        hard together to get really close and effective co-operation between our two
                        countries in the field of foreign affairs that I feel that I must tell you
                        personally of our great disappointment at this development. The effect upon
                        public opinion of all shades has been deplorable.<note n="1" xml:id="d89fn1"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Friend</hi>: I expect you are as much worried
                            about the Greers Dam turbine contract as I am. Representations have been
                            made in the normal way by Harold Caccia to Foster and also to Jock
                            Whitney by our trade people. I am not going to argue the pros and cons
                            because I know so well how difficult these questions are.</p>
                        <p>What really worries me about this turbine contract is the injury that so
                            small a thing can do to the cause that you and I have so much at heart
                            of Anglo-American co-operation and understanding and the liberalism and
                            interdependence with which your name will always be associated.</p>
                        <p>I do not know whether it is too late or whether your machinery allows
                            some re-opening of the question. If so I can only tell you that it would
                            do a great deal of good if the decision could be reversed.</p>
                        <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0226"/>
                        <p>In any case, I personally will do everything I can to reduce the impact
                            of this upon our folk here rather than exaggerate it. You can rely on me
                            for this. But of course it would be very much more effective if the
                            decision could be reconsidered.</p>

                                surpluses help in similar ways. Yet in some parts of world millions
                                of people are still hungry. This condition due partly to problems
                                that cannot be wholly remedied by larger food supplies from abroad.
                                Even <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0227"/>so, we in America must
                                do more assure food abundance—our own and that of our friends
                                abroad—is used as effectively as possible where it most urgently
                                needed.</p>
                            <p>My earnest hope is our people will put their hearts as well as minds
                                into this effort. It is more than surplus disposal, more than
                                attempt foster ties and sympathies for America. It is effort that I
                                consider in full keeping with American tradition—helping people in
                                dire need who with us are devoted upholding and advancing cause of
                                freedom. It is undertaking that will powerfully strengthen our
                                persistent and patient efforts build enduring, just peace.</p>

                                has long been important concern of United Nations’ Food and

                                proposed another substantial attack upon problem through
                                international food campaign. His proposal concerned with many longer

                    <p>At his February 25 press conference, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> was asked about a Tennessee Valley Authority
                        decision to award a contract for a steam turbine to a British firm, and
                        whether the protests this decision had sparked would cause the United
                        Kingdom “to cut back on its recent liberalization of dollar trade.” The
                        President replied that he felt the United States should continue to support
                        free trade. He also noted that he believed the United States was having
                        trouble competing with other manufacturing countries because its costs were
                        too high. “We cannot,” he stated, “continue to increase these costs and have
                        the kind of foreign trade that will make our own country prosperous.” For

                        what was contemplated here was only an administrative action. The President

                        350,000 pounds of high quality wool over the breaking point are subject to
                        only 30% rather than 45% ad valorem, and if the breaking point is not
                        lowered below the present 14.2 million pounds.</p>

                            <item>In granting a tariff concession on woolen and worsted fabrics in
                                1947, the United States reserved the right to increase the tariff on
                                those imports that, in any year, exceed five percent of average
                                domestic production over the preceding three years. The concession
                                and Reservation were negotiated with the United Kingdom and extended
                                to other <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> countries.</item>

                            <item>This Reservation was first invoked by a proclamation of the
                                President in September 1956<note n="4" xml:id="d92fn4">For text of
                                    Proclamation No. 3160, September 28, 1956, effective October 1,
                                    1956, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                    October 8, 1956, pp. 556–557.</note> for the last quarter of
                                1956. This proclamation provided that after imports during any year
                                reached a certain “breakpoint,” subsequent imports during that year
                                would be subject to a duty of 45% ad valorem instead of the
                                concession rate of 20 or 25% (depending on the fabric). There is, in
                                addition, a duty of 30 cents or 37.5 cents per pound, but that
                                doesn’t change.</item>

                            <item>The President established breakpoints for 1957 and 1958,
                                respectively of 14 and 14.2 million pounds. In each case, the
                                breakpoint approximated 5% of production over the preceding three
                                years. The 5% figure for 1959 is about 13.5 million pounds. The
                                Trade Policy Committee will probably recommend a breakpoint in that
                                amount within a week or two. That recommendation will, of course, be
                                reviewed in the White House.</item>

                            <item>Until last year, the ad valorem part of the duty was 45% for all
                                imports in excess of the breakpoint for the given year. Exceptions
                                were made last year for two kinds of fabrics: certain handwoven
                                woolens less than 30 inches wide (principally, certain Scottish and
                                Irish tweeds) and certain “religious” fabrics (that is, special
                                fabrics used in the manufacture of apparel for members of religious
                                orders, such as nuns’ veiling). Imports of these items—after the
                                breakpoint in any year is passed—are subject to duty of 30% rather
                                than 45%.</item>

                            <item>An additional exception may be proposed by the Trade Policy
                                Committee for 1959. The tentative proposition is that certain
                                “high-cost and high-quality” fabrics will be subject to a duty of
                                30% (rather than 45%) after the overall breakpoint is passed. This
                                special rate may be limited, however, to the first 350 thousand
                                pounds of such imports after the overall breakpoint is passed. If it
                                is possible to frame an administratively feasible definition for
                                such fabrics, the additional exception would be of primary benefit
                                to British exporters.</item>

                                Japan, Italy, France. Some other European countries ship much

                            <item>Nearly everyone affected is unhappy with the tariff quota and the
                                Reservation. To allay some of this concern, the President last year
                                directed the Secretary of Commerce to make a “special review” of
                                “alternatives to the present arrangements.” The Trade Policy
                                Committee proposal may not be thought by the industry to fulfill

                    <p>The Prime Minister expressed the great concern of the United Kingdom over the
                        heavy electrical case now before the <gloss target="#t_OCDM1">OCDM</gloss>.
                        He said that if there was an unfavorable decision in this case the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would be required to take some sort of
                        retaliatory action. The Prime Minister then pointed out the great need of
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> for trade and the difficulty which the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would have if they were not allowed to
                        sell their products in the world market, and particularly in the United
                        States. In reply, I reminded the Prime Minister of the fact that <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> dollar imports to the United States had
                        increased over the past year by about 18% and that in the first two months
                        of 1959 they were running about 20% over the similar months in 1958.
                        Therefore, I did not think the U.S. record in the trade field was at all bad
                        as far as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was concerned. I recognized
                        that an adverse decision in the heavy electrical case would have a larger
                        impact on the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> than previous actions which
                        had caused concern. I also explained to the Prime Minister the procedures
                        which would be followed in coming to a decision on the heavy electrical case
                        and the probable time factor. The Prime Minister asked Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_CH1">Caccia</persName> if there was anything further the
                        British should do in making known their concern and stated that he had
                        spoken to the President about the seriousness of this particular
                            matter.<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">See <ref target="#d19">Document
                                19</ref>.</note> He said this was by far the most important matter
                        in our trade relations at the moment. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CH1"
                            >Caccia</persName> said that he did not think there was anything
                        additional for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to do at this time as
                        he thought we were well aware of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        attitude. I confirmed that we had received a full expression of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> position from the British Embassy and did not
                        think anything else was required.</p>

                    <p>I explained to the Prime Minister that we had examined the British idea of
                        country quotas and had found this to be a very difficult matter. I pointed
                        out that the imposition of a country quota would in effect be directed
                        against Japan. I explained that this would cause direct difficulties for us
                        in the present case but would be even more difficult as setting a very
                        dangerous precedent. I pointed out that there were many private interests in
                        the United States which would like nothing better than the establishment of
                        quotas directed against Japan, and said that the Administration had resisted
                        this type of pressure as a matter of general principle although there had
                        been a few voluntary quota agreements with the Japanese in the most
                        difficult cases. I reminded the Prime Minister that the burden of
                        maintaining an adequate market for Japanese overseas trade fell more heavily
                        on the United States because of the fact that some of the European nations,
                        including the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, had not as yet given the
                        Japanese most-favored-nation treatment under the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>. Because of all these considerations, I said that we had
                        come to the conclusion that a country quota arrangement would not be
                        practicable.</p>
                    <p>I then said that we had examined the situation to see what we could do to
                        alleviate the situation as far as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was
                        concerned. I told the Prime Minister that the Japanese had informed us that
                        this year they were going to limit their exports of lower-priced woolens to
                        the U.S. and that we understood that this limitation would result in some
                        drop in the over-all percentage of the U.S. market held by Japanese imports.
                        Secondly, I said that we were working on a plan for submission to the
                        President which would provide a special quota for certain high-priced
                        specialized woolens with a tariff of 30 percent. I said the cut-off price we
                        had in mind for these woolens was six or <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201"
                            facs="0233"/>seven dollars a pound, depending on the weight of the
                        material and that we would hope that this would cover approximately $2½
                        million worth of materials.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> evinced an
                        understanding of our position regarding country quotas and seemed to feel
                        that the proposed action on higher-priced goods would be of considerable
                        help as this was the type of woolens in which the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> was particularly interested. He hoped that a decision on
                        this could be announced in the relatively near future, and I told him that
                        we were hopeful of getting a decision in the next two or three weeks. The
                        Prime Minister then asked about the over-all size of the quota for the
                        coming year, and I said this was set by law at 5% of a three-year average of
                        our domestic production. As a result of a poor year last year the quota
                        would be somewhat smaller this year than had been the case last year. I then
                        said that the whole operation of this quota had been very unsatisfactory and
                        therefore we felt it would be advisable to consider the renegotiation of
                        this provision in the fall of 1961 when it would come up for renegotiation
                        under the provisions of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. I pointed
                        out that this would take place simultaneously with the expected new round of
                        tariff negotiations under the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and said
                        that although there would be obvious risks involved in a higher tariff, it
                        seemed that the present situation was so unsatisfactory that a renegotiation
                        ought to produce something better. I said, however, that our final decision
                        on this would be influenced considerably by the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> attitude toward such a renegotiation, and asked for the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> views on this matter. It was left that
                        this should be a matter of further study and conversation between us as the
                        decision would not have to be taken for another year or so.</p>

                            corresp="#p_MTD1">True D. Morse</persName> signed for the United States
                        on April 22. The agreement remained open for signature through April 24.
                        Parts I and III-VIII entered into force for the United States on July 15,
                        while Part II entered into force on August 1. For text of the agreement, see

                            >OCDM</gloss> investigation of imports of heavy electrical equipment
                        under the terms of the national security amendment of the Trade Agreements
                            Act.<note n="1" xml:id="d100fn1">See <ref target="#d88">Document

                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> reviewed the history of
                        the industry’s petition, noting that in January 1959 it was limited to four
                        specific types of equipment: (1) hydraulic turbines (2) hydraulic
                        turbine-driven generators (3) transformers, and (4) power circuit breakers.
                        On the basis of voluminous testimony and documentation he found that there
                        was no national security threat from imports of the last three types of
                        equipment but that imports of hydraulic turbines constituted a threat within
                        the meaning of Section 8. The principal basis for this conclusion was the
                        need for elephant tools, such as those used in plants manufacturing
                        hydraulic turbines, particularly to restore power and to make other
                        necessary civilian repairs following a nuclear attack. He requested the
                        official views of each representative with respect to his finding on
                        hydraulic turbines.</p>
                    <p>After hearing each representative Governor <persName corresp="#p_HLA1"
                            >Hoegh</persName> summarized the consensus of the meeting as
                        recommending against any finding that imports of hydraulic turbines are
                        impairing the national security. Although he did not indicate what he
                        proposed to do in the light of the unanimous recommendation against his
                        proposed finding, he thanked those present for their frank expression of
                        views and stated that he planned to report to the President within about a
                        week.</p>
                    <p>Among the principal points made at the meeting were the following:</p>
                    <p>By Assistant Secretary McGuire of Defense: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Repair of hydraulic facilities would probably have a fairly low
                                priority following a nuclear attack.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Although Defense has a need for elephant tools, the need can be
                                adequately met from facilities other than those currently engaged in
                                the manufacture of hydraulic turbines.</item>
                        </list></p>

                    <p>By Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD1">Paarlberg</persName> of the White House: <list>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Only about 10 percent of the U.S. stock of elephant tools are in
                                plants making hydraulic turbines.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>95 percent of U.S. demand for hydraulic turbines is met from
                                domestic sources and only 5 percent from imports.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>It follows from points 3 and 4 above that, if imports were cut off
                                completely, the addition to our total stock of elephant tools would
                                not exceed 5 percent of 10 percent of the total, i.e., about ½ of 1
                                percent.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>By Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>: <list>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>The case for restricting imports of hydraulic turbines is being
                                made more on grounds of injury to the industry than on legitimate
                                national security grounds. It is important to avoid the precedent of
                                using the national security route in what is more properly a case
                                for consideration under the escape clause by application to the
                                Tariff Commission.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>While agreeing with Mr. <persName>McGuire</persName>’s point that
                                hydraulic turbine facilities are not essential for national security
                                reasons, it is necessary to take a broader view of the national
                                security effect of import restrictions in terms of our allies’
                                reaction, since we depend on them for military bases and other types
                                of defense support. In the U.K. view this is the most important
                                economic issue in relations between the two countries since the
                                Smoot–Hawley Tariff<note n="2" xml:id="d100fn2">Reference is to the
                                    Tariff Act of 1930.</note> was enacted. Moreover, following the
                                uproar over the Greer’s Ferry decision we gave the British
                                assurances that the decision was no precedent for future actions,
                                which would be taken only on a case-by-case basis. Any possible
                                damage to U.S. national security from imports of hydraulic turbines
                                would be outweighed by the broader adverse national security effect
                                of taking the restrictive action.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>The U.K. has indicated its readiness substantially to open up its
                                remaining quotas on dollar imports. Restrictive action on electric
                                equipment would probably result in such a sharp political reaction
                                in the U.K. as to prevent the Government from going ahead with its
                                liberalization plans; in fact, it might well have to take
                                retaliatory action. U.K. imports of machinery from the U.S. are
                                considerably greater than their exports of such items to this
                                country.</item>

                            <item>With the availability of the escape clause and the “buy American”
                                advantages already enjoyed by the electrical industry, there is no
                                need for additional protection for the heavy electrical industry at
                                this time.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>If restrictive action were taken, we would have to invoke the
                                national security exception in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                    >GATT</gloss> to square such action with our international
                                obligations. This is a dangerous precedent, however, since the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> contains no objective test
                                of damage to national security, and our action might well open up
                                the use of the exception for widespread restrictive action by other
                                countries.</item>

                        President had recently asked the State Department to prepare for the Council
                        a report on the effects of our trade policy, primarily our import
                        restrictions, on the national security. He then indicated that Mr. <persName

                        that we were actually concerned about a real runaway boom. It therefore
                        seemed a good time for the U.S. to try to develop a better feeling and
                        sentiment about our trade policy insofar as it concerned friendly foreign
                        countries. The President pointed out that no less than eleven foreign
                        countries were affected by our import restrictions on clothespins yet the
                        President believed that all the clothespins in the U.S. were made by six
                        small companies in the State of Maine, employing as the President recalled,
                        only some 260 employees. This kind of situation seemed silly to the
                        President.</p>
                    <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0242"/>
                    <p>The President then observed that meetings have been occurring designed to
                        devise some kind of an adjustment policy which would enable us to find a
                        solution for some of our domestic industries in the face of foreign
                        competition. For example, it might be possible to change from the
                        manufacture of clothespins to the manufacture of baseball bats. Most such
                        suggestions, however, get turned down. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> pointed out certain difficulties which lay in the way
                        of making the kind of adjustments mentioned by the President.</p>
                    <p>The President next observed that in effect what we have to do is to bribe the
                        Congress by agreeing to the restriction of imports in order to induce
                        Congress to agree to extending the Trade Agreement Acts.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> commented on an
                        interdepartmental study of our trade policy.<note n="1" xml:id="d101fn1">Not
                            further identified.</note> He believed that we ought to take a look,
                        industry by industry, to try to calculate the gains and losses in the light
                        of our current trade policy. Once such a painstaking examination had been
                        made, continued Secretary Anderson, there ought to be a broader
                        consideration before the study was made public. Specifically, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> recommended that the
                        findings of the interdepartmental study should be looked at by the National
                        Advisory Council (<gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>) in the light of our
                        balance of payments situation and the outflow of American gold and dollars.
                        There had been a very significant change with respect to our balance of
                        payments situation even since 1956. In most of the highly developed foreign
                        countries at the present time, as well as in a number of less well developed
                        countries, there had ceased to be any such thing as a dollar shortage.
                        Altogether they held some sixteen billions of our dollars at the present
                        time. To these facts must be added commercial balances, the cost to the U.S.
                        of maintaining soldiers and other U.S. Nationals abroad, and payments made
                        abroad by American tourists. The total result was that the U.S. is
                        confronted by a consistent balance of payments running against us. The acid
                        test of a sound economy and of a sound currency as well, was the balance of
                        payments situation. In fact, what we are now tending to do is to have the
                        U.S. finance European exports. These European countries should themselves be
                        urged to take some of the same measures we take to finance our own exports.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that he was
                        not really concerned at all at present about encouraging the export of U.S.
                        capital to the Western European countries. They were doing very well. He
                        was, however, concerned about Asia and Africa.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> went on to say that
                        if the balance of payments disparity continues for any considerable number
                        of years, we in the U.S. would be in for real trouble. We have bitten off
                        rather more obligations than we can chew even in the opinion of some foreign
                            <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0243"/>experts. In conclusion,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> repeated his
                        request that the results of the interdepartmental study be examined in the
                        light of our whole policy.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired whether in effect Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> was advocating higher U.S.
                        tariffs. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> replied
                        in the negative but said he was advocating that we cut down on our U.S.
                        expenditures in certain foreign countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, the Acting Secretary of
                        State, commented that the State Department fully recognized the seriousness
                        of the balance of payments problem. We could not continue running a deficit
                        indefinitely. He also expressed himself as in close agreement with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>’s suggestions as to what
                        to do about the problem. There were, however, still other things that might
                        be done, notably, to increase our own U.S. exports. He added that the State
                        Department was working hard on this objective and had experienced a real
                        measure of success as the published figures would ultimately show. In
                        support of this point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> cited examples of agreements by foreign countries to
                        permit an increase in the quotas of U.S. exports to these countries. Thus we
                        were getting rid of some of the examples of discrimination against the
                        dollar and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> believed
                        that the effort should continue to have priority status.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>,
                        if it was necessary to go still further to solve our problem, we must
                        consider amending our current policy on world-wide procurement, as Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had said. We should
                        perhaps furnish goods rather than dollars because when we furnish dollars to
                        other countries they often use these dollars to purchase goods in Europe
                        rather than to purchase them from the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed to
                        the problem of U.S. investment in Europe. He believed that some sort of
                        action, other than trade restrictions, might have to be taken to cut down
                        U.S. capital investment in industrialized foreign countries, although not in
                        the underdeveloped countries. These several possible remedies all recommend
                        themselves to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> as
                        being better than resort to further restrictions on the U.S. imports from
                        foreign countries.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> commented that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s statements seemed
                        to him to be very fair.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> stated that in the
                        study that is being made, he agreed on the need for an overall policy review
                        and in that respect the Department of Commerce did not hold views at
                        variance with the views of Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>.
                        On the other hand, an overall review could not ignore separate and
                        individual cases, problems, and situations. For example, a certain industry
                        might actually constitute the sole support and living for an entire U.S.
                        community. One could not ignore either the political or the sociological
                        considerations <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0244"/>relating to such
                        communities. They are factors to be weighed in looking at individual
                        instances of appeals for restrictions on the import of specific
                        commodities.</p>
                    <p>The President then referred to the National Security Amendment designations
                        in the Trade Agreements Act. He was sure that in this connection there was
                        one consideration which, while it could not be accurately weighed, was
                        nevertheless of very great importance. This was the consideration of our
                        national defense and the effect of restrictions under the NSA designations
                        on the vitality of our military alliances. In illustration of his point, the
                        President cited what he described as the near hysteria occasioned in the
                        U.K. by our decisions against importing British electrical equipment. The
                        President believed that trade restrictions which tend to drive away an ally
                        as dependable as Great Britain would do much more harm in the long run to
                        our security than would be done by permitting a U.S. industry to suffer from
                        British competition. Thus, while intangible, this factor must always be
                        weighed in NSA cases. Yet another illustration of the point that he was
                        making, said the President, was represented by the various stages in the
                        development of atomic weapons. In the early stages of this development,
                        there had been very real and very complete cooperation between the British
                        and ourselves. This superb cooperation had now been destroyed by a law which
                        greatly restricted exchange of atomic energy information with the
                            British.<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2">The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, P.L.
                            703, August 30, 1954.</note> The effect of this restriction on the
                        British had been very serious indeed and because of their own contributions
                        in the early stages, they had felt severely let down when the U.S. imposed
                        its restrictions in the Atomic Energy Act. Thus, said the President, we have
                        got to take account of these intangibles as well as of the tangibles and he
                        certainly agreed likewise that the U.S. must increase the volume of its own
                        exports and improve its own competitive position. The President added that
                        every time he declared a restriction on the import of a commodity from
                        abroad, he was occasioned considerable mental anguish even though approval
                        of the restrictive action had been unanimously recommended to him.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the National Security Amendment, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that even though Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWTM1">Beale</persName> had reported that our
                        organizational arrangements were adequate, there were some of us who were
                        worried about such matters as TVA purchases of electrical equipment. The
                        President replied that the role of such independent agencies as the TVA had
                        bothered the Administration for quite a while inasmuch as the Government
                        could of course not control such agencies and there was doubt about the
                        nature of their relation to the Presidency. In this connection Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> commented on the <pb
                            n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0245"/>effect of the Buy American Act. The
                        President again expressed himself as puzzled about the relation to the U.S.
                        President of such entities as the TVA and the <gloss target="#t_GAO1"
                            >GAO</gloss> (General Accounting Office) which he added, laughingly, did
                        not seem to have any. Nevertheless, such entities the President thought were
                        rather minor and exceptional causes of friction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> predicted that the problem
                        of foreign competition with American business was a problem that was going
                        to grow rapidly in the future. The costs of production abroad of competitive
                        products were shockingly lower than costs in the U.S., mostly as a result of
                        cheaper labor costs. Our shipbuilding industry for example has totally lost
                        its foreign markets. The President commented that one reason for this
                        situation was that it had become so easy for a Board of Directors to think
                        that it can safely pass on added costs to the consuming public. As a result
                        these Boards of Directors soon price their product right out of the
                        market.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Clarence Randall</persName> whether he wished to make
                        any comments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> replied
                        that he certainly did but that he would try to spare the President and the
                        Council a lengthy recital of his very strong feelings on the subject. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> then expressed himself as
                        very deeply concerned about the erosion of the U.S. trade position. He was
                        convinced that what was really vital above all else was a continuation of
                        the policy of liberalizing trade which the President had proclaimed and
                        stood for since the beginning of his first term. There was another matter
                        which concerned him, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                        >Randall</persName>, and which had not thus far been mentioned in the
                        discussion. This was our obvious and increasing dependence on overseas
                        markets for certain very important raw materials. As for the National
                        Security Amendment, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>
                        believed that it was never intended to apply other than in a very broad
                        sense. We must therefore continue to look upon its application in the
                        broadest possible sense. The President expressed thorough agreement with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>’s position on this
                        point.</p>

                        <p rend="center">TRADE POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY</p>
                        <p>The broad objective of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> foreign economic
                            policy is identical with that of our general foreign policy: to protect
                            and advance the national interest, to improve the security and
                            well-being of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and its people.</p>
                        <p>This broad objective of our foreign economic policy has three major
                            components. First, to promote the economic strength of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, second, to promote the economic strength
                            of the rest of the free world, and third, to build and maintain cohesion
                            in the free world.</p>
                        <p>To achieve these objectives we have followed three basic economic
                            policies: The expansion of trade; the promotion of private investment;
                            and provision of mutual assistance.</p>
                        <p>During the past 6 years, by building on existing programs and, even more
                            important, by developing new programs designed to meet new needs and
                            changing conditions, there has been created a complex pattern of
                            interrelated programs. Some of them we carry out on our own and others
                            in cooperation with friendly nations. These programs are well suited to
                            the promotion of our basic objectives.</p>
                        <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0247"/>
                        <p>At the present time, however, the achievement of these objectives is
                            endangered from within by the growth of protectionist sentiment and from
                            the outside by the Soviet economic offensive. My purpose this morning is
                            to suggest some of the ways in which protectionism adversely affects our
                            domestic economy, our political-economic relations with our allies and
                            therefore our national security.</p>
                        <p>I would like to deal first with the general aspects of the problem and
                            then turn to specific illustrations.</p>
                        <p>Protectionism has certain recognizable benefits. It can assure the
                            survival of a sensitive industry which might otherwise succumb because
                            of its competitive disadvantages. It can provide a blanket for an infant
                            industry during its formative years. It can prevent economic and social
                            disruption in a community dependent on a single industry and without the
                            resources to develop alternative industries.</p>
                        <p>In spite of these recognizable advantages, however, there are relatively
                            few people who would contend that protectionism provides a basis for a
                            dynamic expanding economy. The reasons are obvious. Protection
                            discourages the development of new products, new methods of production
                            and distribution, and cost-saving techniques.</p>
                        <p>Protection reduces our ability to compete with other industrialized
                            economies.</p>
                        <p>Protection contributes to inflation by raising the costs of the products
                            we buy abroad.</p>
                        <p>It imperils our export markets by making it more difficult for other
                            countries to earn the dollars they need in order to buy from us. It also
                            endangers those markets by inviting retaliation on the part of other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Protectionist measures inevitably reduce total <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> output by preventing the shift of domestic resources
                            from less efficient to more efficient industries. By lowering our total
                            national product, such measures slow down our rate of growth and reduce
                            the resources available for our security needs, including aid to the
                            less developed countries.</p>
                        <p>Having indicated the effects of protectionist policy on the domestic
                            economy, I would like to indicate briefly the effects on the economies
                            of other countries.</p>
                        <p>Foreign trade is vitally important to our economy, but even so it
                            constitutes only 4% of our gross national product. In other major
                            industrial countries (such as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                            West Germany and France) the ratio of exports to gross national product
                            is 3 to 4 times greater. It is 5 to 9 times as great for smaller
                            advanced nations such as Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands. For
                            example, approximately one-half of everything the Netherlands produces
                            is shipped abroad.</p>
                        <p>Our trade policy is of tremendous concern to all of these countries,
                            first because exports play such a major role in their economies and
                            secondly because the United States is a major market for their <pb
                                n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0248"/>goods. Both of these reasons
                            explain why any action by the United States which adversely affects
                            sales of their key products, or threatens those sales, is front page
                            news abroad and has a serious effect on our international relations with
                            those countries. This is true even when the action itself does not seem
                            important to us.</p>
                        <p>I can cite five specific examples of restrictive measures which have
                            adversely affected four important allies. Lead and zinc affecting
                            Canada, cheese affecting the Netherlands, electrical equipment and
                            woolen fabrics affecting the United Kingdom and cotton textiles
                            affecting Japan.</p>
                        <p>In the case of many less developed countries, one, or a few commodities,
                            comprise the bulk of their exports. For many of these countries the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> market is especially important. To
                            illustrate this point, the United States imports <list>
                                <item>⅔ of Chile’s copper</item>
                                <item>½ of Cuba’s sugar</item>
                                <item>¼ of Indonesia’s rubber</item>

                                <item>over ½ of Brazil’s coffee</item>
                                <item>2/5 of Venezuela’s oil</item>
                                <item>⅔ of Peru’s lead and zinc.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The ability of the less developed countries to sell their products in the
                            United States affects their ability to import capital goods and other
                            necessary manufactured products.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it determines in large measure the basis of their economic
                            growth and their ability to raise standards of living.</p>
                        <p>The promotion of economic growth in the less developed countries is of
                            course a prime objective of our foreign policy. By this means we hope to
                            help those countries to achieve peace and stability. Unfortunately their
                            economic health can be seriously damaged by <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> import restrictions. Our import quotas on petroleum,
                            lead and zinc, and cotton, for example, have had that effect on Mexico,
                            Venezuela, Peru, Indonesia, Egypt, the Sudan and other less developed
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union, of course, recognizes clearly the major role that trade
                            can play in furthering its objectives. The evidence clearly shows that
                            friendly countries, when denied access to our market, are forced to
                            increase their economic dependence on the Soviet Bloc. As a specific
                            example, after the imposition of restrictions against Uruguayan wool
                            tops in 1953, the Soviet Bloc steadily increased its purchases, and as a
                            result it is now the most important outlet for Uruguayan wool tops.
                            Recently our countervailing duty on wool tops was removed. As you know,
                            our action to impose quotas on lead and zinc was followed by violent
                            anti-American reactions in Peru and there have been sharp reactions in
                            Venezuela to our oil import policy.</p>
                        <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0249"/>
                        <p>In assessing where we stand today it is important, of course, to keep the
                            picture in balance. On the one hand, since 1953 we have pursued an
                            active policy for the promotion of international trade. We have taken
                            part in two successful trade conferences in 1955 and 1956.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d101fn5">Presumably the 10th and 11th sessions of the
                                Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
                                held at Geneva October 27–December 3, 1955, and October 11–November
                                17, 1956, respectively.</note> It is true that many of the tariff
                            concessions we gave at those conferences were small, amounting to no
                            more than a 15% reduction in the existing duty. Nevertheless imports of
                            the products affected by the concessions were valued at approximately $1
                            billion. A great deal of attention has been given to escape clause
                            actions that we have found it necessary to take in recent years.
                            Unfortunately little account is taken of the applications that were
                            turned down. Other countries often fail to acknowledge that out of 27
                            cases in which escape clause action was recommended by the Tariff
                            Commission no action was taken in 19 cases.</p>
                        <p>On the other side of the balance, there are the various restrictive
                            measures that have been taken. You will note from the chart that since
                            1953 we have taken restrictive action on 29 commodity groups exported
                            from 45 free world countries.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a table outlining “Action Taken To Restrict Imports, Since
                            January 1, 1953, and Commodities Affected.”]</p>
                        <p>It is statistically impossible to determine precisely how much trade is
                            affected by these restrictions. However, it has been calculated on the
                            basis of the latest figures available, that is for 1957, the trade
                            affected by these restrictions represented about $2.1 billion or 28% of
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> imports of competitive items. Out
                            of this total oil products account for approximately $1.5 billion and
                            the remaining items account for about $600 million. These figures are
                            subject to a number of qualifications. For one thing the more effective
                            the action in restricting imports the smaller the trade.</p>
                        <p>You will note from the map<note n="6" xml:id="d101fn6">Not found.</note>
                            that some countries are affected by only one restriction, whereas others
                            are affected by as many as twelve. Venezuela for example, has been
                            affected only by our restrictions of oil imports, but oil directly
                            involves more than 80% of that country’s exports to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>I would like to comment briefly on several of the more important cases
                            shown on the chart.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi rend="italic">Heavy electrical equipment</hi>—Our decision on
                            the Greer’s Ferry case created an uproar in the United Kingdom. One
                            extreme sector of British opinion called for immediate discrimination
                            against purchases in the United States. The British consider the pending
                                <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0250"/><gloss target="#t_OCDM1"

                            our position in a country which is the southern anchor of our Pacific
                            defense perimeter.</p>
                        <p>In Canada our lead and zinc action was viewed in the context of a number
                            of other United States policies and actions which have been the source
                            of increasing resentment, such as our restrictions on agricultural
                            imports and our surplus agricultural disposal operations.</p>
                        <p>Mexican press, labor and management officials were also very critical.
                            Intensely emotional demonstrations and condemnation of the United States
                            occurred in Peru.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Petroleum</hi>—The Venezuelans have asked for equal
                            treatment on the grounds that their oil, like Canada’s, is vital to the
                            defense and security of the Western Hemisphere. We are worried that the
                            Venezuelans will institute oil pro-rationing and export controls to the
                            disadvantage of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> companies. We have to
                            recognize that they may want to change our bilateral trade agreement
                            drastically and possibly abrogate it. Either course of action would
                            seriously hurt our large export sales to Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>The second chart shows that there are now outstanding 13 requests for
                            restrictions on imports. These represent trade valued at approximately
                            $300 million in 1957. They would affect six new countries, in addition
                            to those already affected by previous measures.</p>
                        <p>This second chart also reflects a trend which is giving other countries
                            great concern. You will note that seven out of the thirteen requests now
                            pending have been made under the national security amendment. There is a
                            strong feeling abroad that domestic industries are seeking to use the
                            national security amendment to achieve protection which they do not
                            think they can obtain by applying under the escape clause.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a table outlining “Pending Proposals for Restrictive
                            Action.”]</p>
                        <p>No discussion of restrictive measures would be complete, of course,
                            without some mention of so-called “voluntary export controls.” These are
                            the measures which other countries, such as Japan and Italy, have taken
                            to restrict their exports to us. They represent a new kind of
                            protectionism—protection in reverse—under which the exporting country
                            limits its exports rather than the importing country its imports. At
                            present, it is estimated, one-half of Japan’s exports to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> are subject to some form of
                            restriction.</p>
                        <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0251"/>
                        <p>Viewed independently, and in perspective, the specific restrictions
                            imposed in recent years may seem relatively unimportant. Nevertheless,
                            it has been made abundantly clear to us that these restrictions are
                            having an increasingly serious effect upon our ability to achieve our
                            foreign policy objectives. And it is apparent that the <hi rend="italic"
                                >potential</hi> for harm <hi rend="italic">greatly</hi> exceeds the
                            harm done thus far. It is possible to identify, as I have done, the
                            cases where individual countries have been adversely affected by
                            restrictions we have imposed. The impact has varied in each case. The
                            cumulative impact has also varied.</p>
                        <p>We believe that we have reached a point, however, where any action has a
                            disproportionate impact because of the preceding actions, and where the
                            element of fear of the future can be expected to play an increasingly
                            important part in determining foreign reactions to any further
                            restrictive measures we may impose.</p>
                        <p>At the present time most of the important industrialized countries of the
                            world have overcome, or are about to overcome, the balance of payments
                            difficulties which justified their retention of protective measures
                            following the war. Therefore we can expect to see an expansion of world
                            trade and consequently, of our own export sales. At the same time the
                            less developed countries of the world are seeking to expand their
                            economies. It is clear, however, that at this juncture the course of
                            future events will be determined almost entirely by what the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> does. If we provide the leadership in
                            liberalizing trade, the rest of the free world can be expected to follow
                            our example.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of critical choices to be made in the immediate
                            future. Regional trading arrangements are proliferating around the
                            world. In Europe the six-country common market is already a going
                            concern. Negotiations are seriously under way toward establishment of a
                            free-trade area of seven other countries in Western Europe—the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, the Scandinavian countries, Austria,
                            Switzerland and Portugal. South America is determined to organize one or
                            more common markets; and Central America is already committed to
                            establishing a customs union.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy in the trade field will
                            determine to a very large extent the evolving course of these
                            arrangements—whether they will look <hi rend="italic">outward</hi>
                            toward the development of a multilateral world trading system, or
                            whether they will look inward in the pursuit of self-sufficiency.</p>
                        <p>A major test of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy is pending in
                            the tariff negotiations scheduled to start in September 1960. These
                            negotiations are the result of our initiative. A principal element will
                            be the effort of many countries to negotiate reductions in the common
                            tariff of the European common market. However, some of our European
                            allies have already expressed doubt about the extent to which we will be
                            willing to offer <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0252"/>real and
                            meaningful concessions in our own tariff in order to give impetus to the
                            successful conclusion of the world-wide negotiations. The success of
                            these negotiations, therefore, will depend upon us.</p>
                        <p>Our basic national security interests require that we continue to
                            exercise positive and dynamic leadership not only in political and
                            military fields but also in the economic fields.</p>
                        <p>That is why the Department of State is convinced that every action we
                            take that adversely affects our ability to maintain a dynamic expanding
                            domestic economy and weakens the ability of our allies to maintain their
                            political and economic stability, has serious implications for our
                            national security.</p>
                        <p>Let me conclude by saying that, in our judgment, the organizational means
                            are already available through which national security considerations can
                            be brought to bear in the most important cases involving proposals for
                            restrictive measures. This is true in escape clause cases, where the
                            Trade Policy Committee is responsible for advising the President. It is
                            also true in cases arising under the national security amendment to the
                            Trade Agreements Act, which provides that the advice of all interested
                            agencies shall be sought in arriving at a recommended course of action.
                            Measures taken under Section 22 are the most outstanding exception to
                            this generalization. Furthermore, considerations of national security
                            cannot be brought to bear in determining whether restrictive action
                            should be taken in other cases, such as antidumping cases. However,
                            these exceptions do not affect the general conclusion that the existing
                            machinery is generally satisfactory and is working well. It is the
                            Department’s view that it would not be desirable, if indeed politically
                            feasible, to attempt to revise existing legislation to insure the
                            inclusion of appropriate provisions permitting national security
                            considerations to be taken into account in all cases involving
                            restrictive action.</p>
                        <p>I do not mean to suggest that there is no need for action in this field.
                            We are much aware of the need for more information as a basis for policy
                            determinations. As you know, a number of studies are currently underway
                            which will provide an analysis of the causes of recent changes in our
                            foreign trade position. An interdepartmental committee, under the
                            chairmanship of the Department of Commerce, will search for the answers
                            to a number of pertinent questions. Have advances in productivity in the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> lagged behind those occurring
                            elsewhere? Have our major costs increased too rapidly? Have we, through
                            price supports and import restrictions, artificially raised the costs of
                            raw materials to our own manufacturers? Does our domestic tax system
                            militate against investment and technological improvement?</p>
                        <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0253"/>
                        <p>At the initiative of the Department of State the Committee for a National
                            Trade Policy is also devoting special attention to the problem of our
                            foreign trade position.</p>
                        <p>Increasing protectionism is not the answer to the problem of stimulating
                            advances in productivity. It would insulate domestic industries from
                            pressures to reduce costs and thereby make them less competitive.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, at the present time when an industry is faced with serious
                            injury as a result of imports, there is no alternative but to consider
                            raising duties or imposing quotas. Therefore, the Department of State
                            believes that renewed consideration should be given to sponsoring
                            another avenue of relief through adjustment assistance. This alternative
                            might provide for low-cost loans for modernization and technological
                            improvement, facilities for retraining workers, or conversion to other
                            kinds of manufacture, or even encouragement to relocate factories.</p>
                        <p>Adjustment assistance is the approach being taken in the European Common
                            Market to deal with the problem of internal adjustments to competition.
                            The British have also embarked on a similar program with respect to
                            their domestic textile industry.</p>
                        <p>In short, we have to search constantly for new ways to improve the
                            competitive position of our industry through affirmative actions rather
                            than by building a wall against entry of goods from abroad.</p>
                        <p>Our conclusion is relatively simple. What we do to restrict trade and
                            what other countries fear we may do, will determine to an important
                            extent whether our foreign economic policy measures are successful, and
                            whether we are successful in the economic contest with the Soviet
                            Union.</p>

                    <p>On July 14, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Clarence L. Miller testified
                        before the House Agriculture Committee on the administration’s proposals for
                        P.L. 480. Miller suggested that the law be extended one year and that a
                        provision be added making surplus agricultural commodities available to
                        underdeveloped countries for the establishment of national food reserves.

                        on Tariffs and Trade (<gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>), invoked by the
                        United States since October 1, 1956, the United States has maintained a

                    <p>The Interdepartmental Committee on Trade Agreements (<gloss target="#t_TAC1"
                            >TAC</gloss>), after full consideration of the operation of this quota
                        and the increasingly difficult trading conditions, both for domestic and
                        foreign interests, arising from its operation, recommends that the United
                        States indicate to the United Kingdom and other interested countries that,
                        as requested by the United Kingdom, it will enter into renegotiation of the
                        concessions on tariff paragraphs 1108 and 1109(a).</p>
                    <p>The reservation under which the tariff quota is established is one which was
                        first negotiated under the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> in 1947 but
                        not invoked until 1956. It permits, but does not require, the United States
                        to increase from 20 or 25 percent (depending on the fabric) to 45 percent
                        the ad valorem part of the compound rate of duty on any imports of woolen
                        and worsted fabrics dutiable under the concessions on tariff paragraphs 1108
                        and 1109(a) which are in excess of 5 percent of average annual domestic
                        production of similar fabrics during the preceding three calendar years. The
                        tariff quota may be larger than 5 percent of domestic production on the
                        basis described above, but under our international commitments it may not be
                        less than 5 percent. For imports in excess of the tariff quota the rate of
                        duty may be less than 45 percent but it may not be more than 45 percent.</p>
                    <p>Since the reservation was first invoked in 1956, and particularly during the
                        past year, the agencies represented on the responsible interdepartmental
                        committees have repeatedly reviewed the operation of the wool-fabrics tariff
                        quota. As a result of these considerations the <gloss target="#t_TAC1"
                            >TAC</gloss> has from time to time recommended, and you have approved,
                        interim modifications designed to alleviate immediate problems arising from
                        the operation of the quota. Such modifications have not, however, solved the
                        over-all problem of disruption of the trade of American importers, clothing
                        manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers and of foreign producers and
                        exporters caused by the operation of the quota.</p>
                    <p>Consequently, the <gloss target="#t_TAC1">TAC</gloss> has considered the
                        question of renegotiation, and there have been informal discussions between
                        the United States and other interested governments of possible solutions to
                        the difficulties arising from the operation of the quota. On August 2
                        British Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>
                        informed the Secretary of State<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">Not printed.
                            (Department of State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204)</note>
                        that the United Kingdom Government had concluded that the only solution
                        would be the earliest possible renegotiation and expressed the hope that the
                        United States would initiate action under Article XXVIII:4 of the <gloss

                        renegotiate the concessions in advance of the 1960/61 tariff conference.
                        Therefore, the <gloss target="#t_TAC1">TAC</gloss> recommends that the
                        United States should inform the United Kingdom and other interested

                    <p>316. Following is suggested text draft note dollar discrimination:</p>
                    <p>For many years BLANK and many other countries have enforced quantitative
                        controls over imports to safeguard monetary reserves and the balance of
                        payments. In many cases these controls have been applied with varying
                        degrees of severity with respect to different countries or currency areas.
                        Where such discrimination continues to exist, it usually is most adverse to
                        the trade interests of the United States and of the other countries of the
                        dollar currency area.</p>
                    <p>Last December the main trading currencies previously inconvertible were made
                        externally convertible with the dollar in international trade. In
                        consequence the bulk of world trade is now conducted in currencies readily
                        convertible into dollars. On various occasions in recent months the United
                        States has pointed out that the establishment of external convertibility
                        generally removed the financial justification for discrimination against
                        imports from the dollar area. The United States has welcomed the steps which
                        a number of governments have taken since the advent of external
                        convertibility in further removing non-tariff trade barriers. Added to
                        earlier advances, the progress that has been made is substantial. Clearly,
                        however, more needs to be done; the United States is of the view that the
                        remaining discriminations should be rapidly eliminated.</p>
                    <p>The ease of access to the United States market which foreign countries have
                        enjoyed has contributed to the growth of foreign exchange reserves outside
                        the United States and, in turn, to the move to external convertibility. The
                        trade policies of the United States have been an important contribution in
                        this regard. During a period when duty reductions granted on products
                        exported by the United States <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0261"/>have
                        been impaired by quantitative import restrictions, the United States has
                        given effect to the negotiated reductions in its customs duties, and has
                        resisted pressures to resort to non-tariff restrictions on imports.
                        Considering the favorable economic conditions which prevail in the
                        industrialized countries and general convertibility of world currencies,
                        continued discrimination against United States goods would affect the U.S.
                        attitude toward the 1960–1961 tariff negotiations, and weaken the support of
                        the American public, the business community, and the Congress on which the
                        ability of the United States to carry forward a liberal trade policy
                        depends. Moreover, the use of nondiscriminatory quantitative restrictions
                        that unjustifiably deny United States exporters competitive access to
                        foreign markets would have a similar effect. The consequences of such a
                        development for the world trading community would be grave.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons, which accord with the commitments embodied in the General
                        Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in the Articles of Agreement of the
                        International Monetary Fund, the United States believes that the time is at
                        hand for a new general advance toward the objective of expanding
                        nondiscriminatory multilateral trade among the free world countries. To this
                        end it is approaching the governments of the principal trading nations which
                        impose quantitative import restrictions. Accordingly, the United States
                        Government urges, as a matter of great importance, that the Government of
                        BLANK take the following measures: <list>

                                that such restrictions have been removed with respect to imports of
                                the same products from other countries.</item>

                    <p>On September 11, the House of Representatives and the Senate adopted a
                        compromise version of H.R. 8609 to extend P.L. 480, as amended. H.R. 8609
                        thus became P.L. 86–341 and extended P.L. 480 through December 31, 1961. The
                        law provided for the distribution of agricultural surpluses to needy
                        individuals in the United States and authorized the President to negotiate
                        contracts to sell surpluses to foreign countries for up to 10 years. For

                    <p>The Council was briefed by the Chairman on the impressions he received
                        regarding our foreign economic policy during his recent trip to Europe from
                        U.S. officials in Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, Paris, and London.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said there was great interest in the forthcoming <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations and that most of our
                        officials believed that these negotiations would be a test of U.S.
                        leadership in the liberal trade field. He said there is concern about our
                        balance of payments, and that our embassies are pressing the countries to
                        which they are accredited to eliminate dollar discrimination. On the other
                        hand, he said it was his opinion that there was not a similar urgency to
                        stimulate our export program. He said the embassies have been doing little
                        or nothing to get foreign governments to eliminate their restrictions on
                        travel, which he thought would be one way by which we could materially help
                        our balance of payments. He also said that the “Six” have made good progress
                        in getting the Common Market established and that, as <pb n="231"
                            xml:id="pg_231" facs="0263"/>a result, the transition period will be
                        greatly shortened. He added that the burning question presented to him by
                        our officials is whether the U.S. should publicly support the “Seven”.</p>

                                interest of the United States and other free countries, the United
                                States Delegation to the Thirteenth Session of the Contracting
                                Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (<gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>) proposed last October that the
                                Contracting Parties sponsor a new round of multilateral tariff
                                negotiations. The United States proposal was approved by the
                                Contracting Parties at their Fourteenth Session in May 1959. In
                                proposing the new round of negotiations, the United States was
                                motivated in part by the need to bring about a lowering of the
                                common external tariff of the European Economic Community in order
                                to assure that United States exports will have continuing access to
                                this increasingly vital market and to help ease trade adjustments

                                was the desirability of influencing the development along liberal
                                lines of European trade policies, including those of the new
                                Community. Our aims with respect to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"

                            <item>Just as the initiative of this Government was a determining factor
                                in obtaining the agreement of the Contracting Parties to sponsor the
                                new round of negotiations, so our leadership will be the prime
                                factor in determining their success or failure. It is accordingly
                                important that the United States make a practical demonstration of
                                its intention to negotiate for an exchange of tariff concessions on
                                a scale sufficiently broad to call forth extensive offers from the
                                countries which are <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0265"
                                />preparing to negotiate with the United States. These countries
                                will be greatly influenced by the scope of our public list of import
                                items on which we are prepared to consider offering tariff

                            <item>It is thus in the national interest that the public list submitted
                                to the President by the Trade Agreements Committee through the Trade
                                Policy Committee should be as broad as is consistent with the
                                principle of selectivity on which the operation of the trade
                                agreements program is based. Consistent with past procedures, in
                                applying this principle items should be listed unless there are
                                strong reasons for not doing so. It is understood of course that the
                                listing of an item for consideration in the negotiations does not
                                mean that a decision has been made to offer a tariff concession. In

                                during the rest of the session is the relationship between
                                commercial policy and the new financial situation created early this
                                year when, reflecting improved balance-of-payments and reserve
                                positions, all of the European currencies important in international
                                trade were made externally convertible. U.S. representatives will
                                emphasize that, given the new currency situation, discriminatory
                                import restrictions can no longer be justified on financial grounds.
                                A number of countries have accelerated their progress this year in
                                removing quantitative restrictions against exports from the dollar
                                area, but further progress is necessary to complete the job. A major

                    <p>On October 28, he met with the Japanese Minister of Finance and other
                        Japanese officials to discuss economic issues, including a U.S. desire that
                        Japan liberalize its trade policies. A memorandum of this conversation is
                        scheduled for publication in volume XVII.</p>
                    <p>The following day, the Ministerial Representatives attending the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> session issued a communiqué on their
                        discussions. It acknowledged that “there was no longer any justification on
                        balance-of-payments grounds, for discriminatory restrictions by countries
                        whose export earnings were largely in convertible currencies.” The
                        communiqué stated further that “the present favorable climate of
                        international trade made it important to press on with the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> programme for trade expansion,”
                        specifically, arrangements for the 1960–1961 tariff conference, examination
                        of ways to expand agricultural trade, and efforts to help developing
                        countries increase their export earnings. For text, see <hi rend="italic"

                    </list>
                    <p>Joint State/Commerce Message. Measures to promote U.S. export and tourist
                        earnings were inhibited in the post-war period by the weak financial
                        position of most foreign countries. They spent all of the dollars available
                        to them. Promotional efforts by United States businessmen and commercial
                        officials could not have greatly increased the total sales of American goods
                        and services.</p>
                    <p>For some time now, however, the situation has been markedly altered. Economic
                        recovery and growth in most of the countries of the world has been
                        phenomenal. The major currencies have been made convertible into dollars.
                        Since 1950, foreign countries have gained reserves through transactions with
                        the United States. Over the past year their gain in reserves from the United
                        States has reached the extremely high rate of $3.8 billion.</p>
                    <p>Clearly, the current world economic situation requires the dropping of many
                        of the emergency measures used by foreign nations to protect their balance
                        of payments during the period of the so-called “dollar shortage”. Clearly,
                        the United States cannot sustain for long a continued loss of gold and
                        dollars at the current rate.</p>
                    <p>As recognition of the changed situation, the United States has led in the
                        current drive against discrimination (see Circular Airgram 120)<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d113fn1">Dated August 10. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.,

                        restrictions on world trade.</p>
                    <p>This instruction is in line with these efforts and is designed to improve the
                        ability of the United States to increase its earnings through an expansion
                        of exports and tourism.</p>
                    <p>We must assign a higher priority to specific services which our posts abroad
                        perform to promote U.S. export trade and to eliminate restrictions on travel
                        to the United States. These steps will be taken without reducing the
                        activities of the Foreign Service which aid in the promotion of imports and
                        foreign private investment. Business needs for information on foreign
                        markets are extremely varied and, in today’s <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238"
                            facs="0270"/>day’s competitive market, the active support of the Foreign
                        Service assumes real importance in the furthering of American export
                        interests. Where American exports are meeting the competition in world
                        markets, they are doing it in large part by greater emphasis on product
                        design, distribution efficiency, marketing programs, and quality. This kind
                        of selling places a premium on prompt, factual data on foreign markets,
                        including commercial intelligence.</p>
                    <p>At the suggestion of Commerce, American businessmen are calling on our
                        Embassies and Consulates in greater numbers than ever before, as they go out
                        into the market to meet the customer and to find out what he wants. A new
                        agency index service, designed to inform each Foreign Service post of the
                        name and address of each local representative of an American firm, has just
                        been initiated.</p>
                    <p>The establishment and maintenance of mutually satisfactory relations between
                        international traders in the United States and those abroad have, for many
                        years, constituted major objectives of the U.S. Government (3 FSM 611.1).
                        The Manual spells out the various services provided to business, either
                        directly or indirectly, for the purpose of trade promotion and protection,
                        including: Maintenance of Commercial Reading Room (614.3); Personal
                        Assistance to visiting American Businessmen (617); Trade Contact Surveys
                        (619); Trade Opportunities (640); and Travel and Tourism (680).</p>
                    <p>Commercial reading rooms at each post deserve a high priority in any program
                        for trade development. This is the first point of contact with American
                        business interest for many potential customers. These reading rooms should
                        be properly located for convenient business use, and directories and other
                        publications—needed to give practical assistance and encouragement to
                        potential customers—should be kept current. The reporting of trade
                        opportunities, the issuance of commercial invitations, and the preparation
                        of World Trade Directory Reports and information about travel to the United
                        States are among the practical services that can be developed for qualified
                        business prospects and potential travelers to the United States who call at
                        the reading rooms. Each post is reminded that the commercial reading room is
                        probably the most direct expression that can be made of the interest of the
                        United States Government in positive export trade as well as travel
                        promotion. The establishment of such facilities in locations that help to
                        meet the local business population at least halfway is strongly urged.</p>
                    <p>But it is not enough merely to have such facilities. They must be
                        aggressively promoted. The U.S. Trade Missions which have visited so many
                        countries in the past four years have proved, without a doubt, that there
                        are many thousands of business people—even in the most highly developed
                        countries—who do not have a good knowledge of business activities and trade
                        opportunities in the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0271"/>
                    <p>The use of the extensive libraries of private business publications of the
                        Trade Missions has created thousands of trade opportunities for American
                        business that would not have been developed without the positive approach
                        which the Trade Mission has used. In keeping with the current market
                        situation, the Trade Mission program will emphasize as one of its principal
                        objectives that of increasing the sale of American products.</p>
                    <p>A number of posts which have not had an opportunity to make use of the Trade
                        Mission device to reach out into the commercial consciousness of their area,
                        have nevertheless, taken steps to tell their own business community of the
                        practical assists that they can provide to anyone desiring to do business in
                        the United States. This has been done by means of newsletters (in Iraq and
                        Kuwait); by speaking before chambers of commerce and trade associations (in
                        Australia and England); and by organizing exhibits of American products at
                        trade fairs (in Australia and Italy) to mention a few.</p>
                    <p>The Office of International Travel, Department of Commerce, is greatly
                        impressed with the cooperation it is already receiving from Foreign Service
                        posts in connection with the “VISIT U.S.A. 1960” program. This is the
                        beginning of a long-range program to encourage foreign nationals to visit
                        the U.S.A., in connection with which our own impedimenta have been
                        minimized. It is hoped, therefore, that the posts will make every effort to
                        encourage the removal of outmoded regulations, as well as any other
                        obstacles that restrict travel to the United States. Press releases on
                        “VISIT U.S.A. 1960” will be forwarded to the posts periodically by <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> for use as speech material, as well as
                        for translation and dissemination to the local press.</p>
                    <p>This positive approach to promotion of American export interests through
                        trade and tourism is essential if we are to demonstrate that the United
                        States is seriously interested in doing business abroad. Greater initiative
                        on the part of the Foreign Service in seizing on opportunities to make
                        contact with members of the business community is needed. This effort should
                        not be restricted to the immediate vicinity of each post, but should
                        encompass the entire area of jurisdiction. Descriptive material on American
                        products, as well as tourist literature, should be on hand in each
                        commercial office. Commerce has recently invited industry to contribute such
                        descriptive material in the way of wall mountings, photographs, and other
                        examples of the commercial production available in the United States for use
                        in the commercial reading rooms of the Foreign Service. On July 16 a letter
                        to all state governors by the Secretary of State,<note n="2"

                        make an appropriate display of these materials.</p>
                    <p>Each post is urged to review the status of its services to business, both
                        local nationals and American travelers, to determine whether it is achieving
                        the most effective results in terms of promoting the export of American
                        goods and travel to the U.S.A. In this analysis, attention should be given
                        to the extent to which the commercial functions of the post are identified
                        in the minds of local business and government agencies having an interest in
                        procurement, and the frequency with which the trade promotion interest of
                        the United States is presented to them through speeches and other means; the
                        existence of a local American chamber of commerce (or other group) which
                        might serve to focus attention on American products and travel with as much
                        intensity as may be the case for products of other nations; the use of local
                        trade fairs or exhibitions, including spot displays of American products in
                        department stores or other facilities, the ready availability of information
                        on travel to the U.S.A., and, of course, the existence of legislation or
                        regulations discriminating against products from the United States.</p>
                    <p>Each post is requested to comment on how we can increase U.S. exports to its
                        area and also increase travel to the U.S.A. In arriving at any suggestions
                        for new or expanded services, it would be useful to have the reactions of
                        local business groups or responsible local businessmen.</p>
                    <p>In view of the special emphasis now being placed throughout the United States
                        Government on expanding our earnings through increased American exports and
                        foreign travel to the U.S.A., the personal attention of Chiefs of Mission to
                        these two related fields of activity is requested. It is anticipated that
                        this will generate maximum results.</p>

                            <p>The Commodity Credit Corporation is required by law to export cotton
                                in such quantities as to obtain our “fair share” of the world
                                market.</p>
                            <p>To get the cotton into the market takes, currently, a subsidy of
                                eight cents a pound. (The domestic support price is thirty cents a
                                pound.)</p>
                            <p>Foreign textile operators buy this cotton at eight cents a pound less
                                than our own textile trade is required to pay. Foreign mills make
                                this subsidized cotton into cloth and ship it into the United
                                States. Here it competes with cotton textiles from our own mills,
                                which paid the full support price.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary of Agriculture indicates that there is reason to
                                believe that this situation interferes with the cotton programs
                                which Section 22 is intended to protect. He therefore asks you to
                                request the Tariff Commission to determine whether a fee should be
                                assessed against incoming cotton textiles, equal to the subsidy
                                rate. This would, in effect, equalize the raw material cost for
                                United States and foreign textile mills.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The action recommended by the Secretary of Agriculture has in it much equity
                        and logic. To avert Tariff Commission consideration of this problem would be
                        interpreted as harsh and a failure to understand an industry problem.</p>
                    <p>The domestic textile people have strongly urged this action. In fact, they
                        want to go much further and have proposed that the remedy to be considered
                        be quotas instead of a fee. The Secretary, however, indicates that the
                        limited protection of a fee is all that should be considered by the Tariff
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>There is some hazard in that the Japanese might use any action of ours as an
                        excuse for abandoning their voluntary quotas. Such does not seem, however,
                        to be a strong possibility.</p>
                    <p>The State Department interposes no objection to a Tariff Commission
                        investigation, having been given assurance that they will have a chance to
                        express their views before final action is taken by the President on
                        whatever recommendation comes from the Commission. Other Departments favor
                        the step.</p>

                    <p>The Tariff Commission finding would not, of course, be binding upon the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you institute the Tariff Commission proceedings recommended

                    <p>On December 21, the French, German, U.K., and U.S. Heads of State and
                        Government, who had been meeting at Paris and Rambouillet since December 19,
                        issued a special communiqué on the world economic situation. It asserted
                        that Western Europe’s economic progress enabled nearly all of the
                        industrialized nations of the free world to increase their efforts to
                        further international economic development and to pursue trade policies
                        promoting sound use of economic resources and international harmony. The
                        Heads of State and Government, it continued, believed that “these
                        cooperative principles should also govern the discussions on commercial
                        problems arising from the existence of European economic regional
                        organizations, which are or will be constituted within the framework of the
                        General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, such as the European Economic
                        Community and the European Free Trade Association. Their relations both with
                        other countries and with each other should be discussed in this spirit.”</p>
                    <p>They agreed to meet informally in Paris to discuss the means of implementing
                        these ideas, and suggested that members of the Executive Committee of the

                        prepared for the committee by the Corporation for Economic and Industrial
                        Research, Inc. Martin endorsed the report’s conclusions, including its
                        statement on “the value of a continued liberal approach to our policies on
                        trade with our friends in the free world.” For text of his statement, see

                    <p>On February 17, the U.S.-Canadian Committee on Trade and Economic Affairs
                        issued a communiqué on the results of its fifth meeting, held in Washington
                        February 16–17. The committee “agreed on the desirability of policies
                        designed to bring about even greater expansion of trade on a multilateral
                        basis” and “welcomed the considerable progress since the last meeting in the
                        removal of restrictions and the elimination of discrimination against
                        exports from the dollar area.” Among the other topics it discussed were
                        agricultural problems, the effects on Canadian producers of U.S. quota
                        restrictions on lead and zinc imports and of U.S. cotton supports, and
                        problems arising in both countries from increased imports of low-cost
                        manufactured goods. Finally, the committee considered economic developments
                        in Europe and the roles the United States and Canada might play as a result
                        of them. For text of the communiqué, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign

                    <p>On March 8, the White House reported to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> that the Department of State had “advised the

                        functions, particularly in the scientific and energy fields. State has not

                    <p>On March 17, the President announced that the administration had developed a
                        program to promote the growth of U.S. export trade. Expanding exports in the
                        now highly competitive world markets, he observed, required “a more vigorous
                        effort by both Government and business to improve our capacity for
                        international competition.” Eisenhower outlined a number of steps toward
                        this end, concluding: “With the support of the Congress, this Government can
                        both facilitate and give continued impetus to the expansion of our exports
                        as free world economic progress continues to enlarge the potential for
                        international trade. The rising tide of productivity and prosperity in many
                        nations creates a timely opportunity for mutual benefits from expanding
                        world trade.” (<hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,

                    <p>There are some five types of problems which relate to the question of whether
                        we should now seek to modify the arrangements under which the Buy American
                        Act is now being administered or, indeed, seek to modify or terminate the

                        <label>1)</label>
                        <item>There is, for example, the continuing realization that the Act is
                            inconsistent with the basic philosophy of our foreign economic policy.
                            For over a quarter of a century the United States Government has been in
                            the embarrassing and inconsistent position of discriminating against
                            foreign goods in its own purchasing activities, while at the same time
                            urging an expansion and liberalization of international trade on a
                            nondiscriminatory basis.</item>
                        <label>2)</label>
                        <item>There is the question of whether the Government should continue to
                            penalize itself by paying a premium of 6 to 12 percent more for its
                            purchases of materials of foreign origin than would a private purchaser.

                        <item>A third area of some concern relates to the question of whether
                            inflationary pressures at home are accentuated to the extent that we
                            fail to take advantage of the leveling influence of lower cost foreign
                            goods.</item>
                        <label>4)</label>
                        <item>A fourth area of concern at the moment is, of course, the question of
                            whether the administrative arrangements might be further tightened to
                            reduce foreign imports and thus possibly to ameliorate our balance of

                        <item>A fifth problem—which would call for further tightening of the
                            arrangements—is the argument that present procedures do not fully
                            recognize problems of U.S. industry and the need for maintaining our
                            mobilization base. The following are typical examples: <list>

                                    <p>The National Machine Tool Builders Association recently

                                        threatening the national security. An interagency group
                                        headed by <gloss target="#t_OCDM1">OCDM</gloss> was set up
                                        to study the complaint. The conclusion of this group was
                                        that it is the continued and growing utilization of obsolete
                                        tools in the U.S. which appears to be the threat to the
                                        national security, and that improvement in the welfare of
                                        the metal-working industries must come from the industries’
                                        own efforts to “progress, excel and conquer competition.”
                                        The group further suggested, however, the desirability of
                                        review of the present differentials under E. O. 10582 in the

                    <p>At the request of the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>,
                        the Bureau of the Budget is conducting a review of recent agency experience
                        under the Buy American Act and Executive Order 10582. In order to assist us
                        in evaluating the Order, a comprehensive questionnaire has been developed
                        and sent to all major procuring agencies requesting detailed data by May 16
                        on their procurement under Buy American provisions.</p>
                    <p>We are hopeful that the collected information will provide us with an
                        up-to-date and detailed picture as to the actual quantities and dollar
                        volume of Federal procurement of foreign materials for domestic use, as well
                        as current agency views on how Executive Order 10582 is working.</p>

                    <p>One of the most important obstacles to U.S. exports since 1945 has been the
                        quantitative import restrictions (<gloss target="#t_QRS1">QRs</gloss>) which
                        most of the advanced countries and many of the less developed countries have
                        applied to safeguard their balance-of-payments. <gloss target="#t_QRS1"
                            >QRs</gloss> for this purpose have the sanction of <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Article XII, and in <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Article XIV there is sanction for
                        discrimination in the application of <gloss target="#t_QRS1">QRs</gloss> as
                        necessary to facilitate trade under conditions of currency inconvertibility.
                        In addition, under Article XIV of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                        Articles of Agreement countries restricted payments and transfers for
                        current international transactions. These payments restrictions usually were
                        applied in conjunction with <gloss target="#t_QRS1">QRs</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>During the period of post-war economic rehabilitation and recovery, U.S.
                        policy in respect of QRs was directed at limiting the scope and severity of
                            <gloss target="#t_QRS1">QRs</gloss> applied by foreign countries against
                        U.S. products to a level commensurate with each country’s ability to finance

                        though a prominent feature of that program was the removal of <gloss

                        the end of 1958, U.S. policies regarding aid and trade played an important
                        part in the general improvement in the financial position of the advanced

                    <p>At the close of 1958, the major European trading nations made their
                        currencies convertible with the dollar in international trade. This action
                        signified the end of the era of the shortage of convertible foreign exchange
                        reserves (sometimes called the “dollar gap”) and set the stage for an
                        intensified U.S. campaign for the rapid elimination of trade discrimination
                        against dollar goods, and for the removal of <gloss target="#t_QRS1"
                            >QRs</gloss> in general.</p>
                    <p>This campaign had five landmarks in 1959. On May 11, the Chairman of the U.S.

                            xml:id="pg_251" facs="0283"/>trade discrimination.” Beginning in
                        September, the United States informed Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
                        the Federal Republic of Germany, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Japan,
                        Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, in terms
                        that took into account varying local conditions that (a) discriminations
                        should be promptly removed, (b) further liberalizations should be made
                        rapidly and in a nondiscriminatory fashion and (c) where quantitative
                        restrictions remained, foreign suppliers should have increased access to the
                        market. On September 29 [30],<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">Brackets in the

                    <p>During the closing months of 1959 and continuing in 1960 there were many
                        significant liberalization moves. Major moves were made by Australia,

                                significant progress in eliminating discrimination against U.S.
                                exports and in reducing the general level of their restrictions. As
                                a result the problem today is of much narrower dimensions than at
                                any time in the postwar period. With some exceptions, the principal
                                remaining restrictions in the advanced countries relate to
                                agricultural products and, less generally, to textiles and
                                ceramics—the so-called low-wage imports. The general subject of
                                agricultural protection, in which in most countries domestic
                                politics is a crucial factor, is under consideration in the <gloss

                    <p>Countries which have virtually eliminated discriminations and <gloss

                        process of doing so, are Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Ghana, Malaya, the
                        Netherlands, Norway, Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Sweden, South Africa, and the
                        United Kingdom. New Zealand has eliminated discrimination but still
                        maintains extensive <gloss target="#t_QRS1">QRs</gloss>. Though France still

                        substantial progress toward liberalization in 1960. Germany, which has a
                        temporary waiver of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> provisions
                        against <gloss target="#t_QRS1">QRs</gloss>, is to liberalize additional
                        imports in 1960. Japan maintains an elaborate import control regime, but has
                        taken significant steps to remove discriminations and has promised further
                        action to liberalize imports. Finland has gone far toward eliminating
                        discrimination against U.S. goods, but continues to apply <gloss
                            target="#t_QRS1">QRs</gloss> on many products. Greece, which had

                        improvement in Austria’s foreign exchange position, which for 2 years has
                        been satisfactory. Italy, which has been found by the <gloss

                    <p>Four countries—Italy, Austria, Japan, and France—still present a serious
                        problem of general removal of restrictions.</p>
                    <p>Italy, with reserves enough to pay for more than one year’s imports (putting
                        it in a class with the United States and Switzerland) still restricts a wide
                        range of products. Many of the Italian restrictions are discriminatory. On
                        April 1 Ambassador Zellerbach delivered a strongly-worded note urging prompt
                        and substantial liberalization action by Italy. The subject of Italian
                        import restrictions also will be considered at the 16th <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Session.</p>
                    <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0285"/>
                    <p>Austria, less important than Italy as a market for U.S. exports, also still
                        restricts a wide range of imports, most restrictions being
                        nondiscriminatory. Austria in the past has argued that it could not
                        liberalize further, because its reserves (worth about 7 months’ imports)
                        were too small, and because it had to control trade with the Soviet Bloc.
                        More recently the Austrians have argued that their industry requires the
                        protection from <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> competition which <gloss
                            target="#t_QRS1">QRs</gloss> can afford. Austrian Trade Minister Bock on
                        April 5, 1960 told Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> that discriminatory restrictions on imports of
                        various textiles would be removed this summer.</p>
                    <p>Japan, whose reserves are worth about 4 months’ imports, is not relatively as
                        well off financially as Italy and Austria. Japan’s import restrictions are
                        far reaching—the “liberalization percentage” at April 1 was estimated at 42
                        percent. Japan has announced a program to achieve 70 percent liberalization
                        by April 1961 and to remove restrictions on all imports, except some
                        agricultural products, by 1963. Trade liberalization is under continuing
                        discussion between the U.S. and Japan.</p>
                    <p>Though France still restricts a fairly wide range of imports, it has made a
                        series of liberalization moves and promises more. Remaining French
                        restrictions are mainly on agricultural products.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the other advanced countries, which have gone far in removing
                            <gloss target="#t_QRS1">QRs</gloss>, the remaining restrictions relate
                        to agricultural products and, less generally, to textiles and

                        protection, in which in most countries domestic politics figures

                    <p>During the course of a meeting with Don Paarlberg on May 23, to discuss the
                        uses of PL 480 foreign currencies, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD1"
                            >Paarlberg</persName> indicated that he may discuss with you directly
                        some of the problems which were raised at that meeting. The two broad
                        questions discussed at that meeting were: (1) uses of PL 480 loan
                        repayments; and (2) the new policy recently inaugurated by the Budget Bureau
                        to require dollar appropriations for all <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        uses of foreign currencies acquired under PL 480 sales agreements. The
                        questions which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD1">Paarlberg</persName> may
                        discuss with you are briefly outlined below:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">(1) Use of PL 480 Loan Repayments</hi></p>
                    <p>Up to this point, repayments under 104(g) loans to foreign governments have
                        been small, and there have been no repayments under 104(e) Cooley loans to
                        private enterprise. Those repayments which have been made are held by the
                        Treasury and are made available for sale to <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> Government agencies.</p>
                    <p>Congress has been promised an Administration proposal which would establish
                        general policies for dealing with loan repayments, but because of the
                        failure within the Administration to agree on a proposal it was decided to
                        postpone a submission until the next session of the Congress. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_PD1">Paarlberg</persName> believes that we should agree on a
                        proposal which could be turned over to the next Administration. He will
                        probably suggest that this task should be assigned to the Francis Committee
                        which has been handling this matter.</p>
                    <p>At the time this question was last considered by the Francis Committee, in
                        January of this year, there were several points of difference between the
                        Treasury Department and other Departments. Treasury and Agriculture proposed
                        a revolving fund for Cooley loan repayments, after provisions are made for
                        Treasury sales, the educational exchange program, and the agricultural
                        market development program. The Budget Bureau, the State Department, and the
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> opposed this proposal.</p>

                    <p>The Budget Bureau, with our support, recently inaugurated a new procedure
                        under which <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government agencies will have
                        access to foreign currencies acquired under PL 480 only pursuant to the
                        appropriations procedure. Under this policy there will be two kinds of
                        dollar appropriations: <list>

                    <p>Agriculture is disturbed about the way this new policy has worked out in
                        practice. They contend that the PL 480 statute requires that they be given
                        access to foreign currencies acquired under that statute, and that if they
                        are restricted to the currencies declared to be in excess supply, this
                        purpose of the statute is likely to be negated.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> proposal to be made to the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and, if negotiable, later to Italy and Japan,
                        continues to evolve into an increasingly protectionist device.</p>
                    <p>The first stage, a month ago, was a State-supported position to propose
                        replacing the 24–25 tariff quota by a flat rate of 36% for the bulk of the
                        fabrics, i.e., the peril-point finding rate. Commerce then sought 40%,
                        arguing that our industry needed more than minimum protection afforded by
                        the peril-point rate. Commerce won support from Treasury and Interior.
                        State, at the direction of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                        >Dillon</persName>, next proposed a 36% rate coupled with a minimum specific
                        duty of 72¢ a pound. Under this proposal, the cheaper fabrics, almost all
                        from Italy, would bear the heaviest impact. Italian fabrics valued at $1.00
                        per pound would pay the same duty as <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                        Japanese fabrics valued at $2.00 per pound.</p>
                    <p>On June 6, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> met with White House
                        Staff officials, and reached agreement on a more protectionist rate, i.e.
                        38% coupled with a minimum specific duty of 76¢ per pound.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d125fn1">No further record of this meeting has been

                    <p>In my opinion, there is about a 50–50 chance that the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>, and subsequently Japan, will be willing to negotiate on
                        this. If the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> agrees to negotiate on such a
                        proposal, our approach to Italy may draw a strong reaction. Because of this,
                            <gloss target="#t_WE1">WE</gloss> drafted a brief memo to E on this
                        point, in place of clearing the <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> memo on the
                        proposal for <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Copies of the <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EUR1"
                            >EUR</gloss> memos are attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">Not found

                        endorsed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and delivered
                        to the White House. There was a last-minute minor change, again in the
                        protectionist direction: at the request of the White House Staff a proposed
                        rate for hand-woven fabrics for religious use was raised from 24% to the
                        rate now in effect, <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0293"/>25%. The White
                        House Staff thought there was little if any bargaining power on this item,
                        and that the reduction would only irritate the domestic industry.</p>

                            constitutes a more constructive approach to the problem. Mr. <persName

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have been giving a great deal
                        of thought to your suggested program of Food for Peace and the way in which
                        it might best be developed during the coming months. As you are fully aware,
                        the greatest obstacle to effecting an orderly distribution of surplus
                        foodstuffs arises from fears of those nations which themselves have
                        surpluses which their own economies require them to sell in world markets.
                        In connection with our own PL 480 program, this has been a constant
                        preoccupation with us.</p>
                    <p>In order that the fears of these nations could be allayed and that other
                        nations might become beneficiaries of a portion of the distributions made
                        under a concerted program, I feel it would be very wise to get a sound
                        groundwork laid. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> is
                        at the present time taking a trip to some of the European and Middle Eastern
                        countries. I would recommend strongly that, on his return which is
                        anticipated somewhere around the middle of August, he be requested to
                        undertake some more extended trips which would include such nations as
                        Uruguay, Argentina and Peru in South America, Australia and New Zealand <pb
                            n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0296"/>in the Far East, and, at the same
                        time, while in the latter area, he visit such countries as Indonesia, the
                        Philippines, Formosa and Japan. It would also be helpful if he could examine
                        the sugar situation in the surplus sugar-producing countries like Brazil
                        since sugar will undoubtedly be a subject of considerable controversy in the
                        next few years.</p>
                    <p>I have not tried to be all-inclusive in the suggestions contained herein,
                        but, if you think well of the idea, I would be very glad to work out a
                        specific itinerary which, while it might be large, would at the same time be
                        most useful toward achieving the specific objectives which you have had in
                        mind in connection with your program.</p>
                    <p>I suggest Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> for this
                        particular assignment because of his extensive experience, because of the
                        fact that he has made a great number of contacts in previous travels in
                        these various countries, and is, of course, devoted to the idea of maximum
                        utilization for peace of the surpluses which we may produce.</p>
                    <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                    <p>On August 8, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> sent
                        a special message to the Congress outlining legislation that needed to be
                        enacted before the current session ended. Among the items the President
                        mentioned was “a proposal to be presented in September before the General
                        Assembly of the United Nations, whereby we and other fortunate nations can,
                        together, make greater use of our combined agricultural abundance to help
                        feed the hungry of the world. The United Nations provides a multilateral
                        forum admirably suited to initiate consideration of this effort.</p>
                    <p>“I consider it important that Congress approve a resolution endorsing such a
                        program before the United Nations Assembly convenes.” (<hi rend="italic"

                                reduced as a result of channelling surpluses through the United

                        commented that Food for Peace Coordinator <persName corresp="#p_PD1"
                            >Paarlberg</persName> was considering several alternatives for
                        implementing the proposal, ranging “from using the United Nations as a
                        clearing house for <hi rend="italic">information</hi> to using the United
                        Nations as the distributor of surplus commodities.” Between these lay the
                        option “of turning certain present United States programs over to the United
                        Nations for administration.” The Department of State, he noted, favored
                        using the United Nations as a source of information and continuing to
                        administer programs bilaterally. (Memorandum from <persName

                        pages 449–451. On August 26, the Committee reported S. Con. Res. 116
                        endorsing the President’s plan; for text, see S. Rept. 1922, Eighty-sixth
                        Congress, Second Session. The Senate approved the resolution in a voice vote
                        on August 27, but the House of Representatives took no action on it before
                        Congress adjourned. On October 27, however, the U.N. General Assembly
                        unanimously adopted a revised version of the proposal in Resolution

                    <p>Last November you requested the Tariff Commission to investigate the need for
                        imposing a cotton textile import fee equivalent to our export subsidy on raw
                            cotton.<note n="1" xml:id="d129fn1">See <ref target="#d114">Document

                    <p>That inquiry was prompted by the strong equitable claim of American textile
                        producers who pay the domestic supported price for raw cotton while imported
                        textiles use raw cotton purchased at the lower world market price.</p>
                    <p>The Tariff Commission, with two dissents, found that textile imports do not
                        interfere with the Department of Agriculture’s cotton programs. Accordingly,
                        the Commission recommended no import restrictions.</p>

                            referred to Japanese notice of intention under Article XXVIII of <gloss

                            as “healthy” development in that Japan, seeking to liberalize trade, was
                            moving from exchange controls toward “more normal” method of regulation

                            indicating possible future protectionist trend in Japanese trade policy
                            outlined in following paragraph. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            anxious that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> a) fully appreciate
                            extent of political problems faced by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            Government in trade field and b) carefully consider possible effects on
                            future of Japan’s trade relations generally of the actions it takes in
                            determining future course of Japan’s trade policy.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Because of its adverse balance of payments position Japan, along with
                            certain other countries, has been permitted over the past several years
                            within the framework of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> to
                            impose exchange controls to protect its exchange reserves (not to
                            protect domestic industry). Because of the vast improvement in Japan’s
                            payments position its highly restrictive system of exchange controls is
                            no longer justified, and Japan has therefore embarked on a program of
                            trade liberalization. It is not valid, therefore, for the Japanese to
                            maintain that the substitution of increased tariffs (a protectionist
                            measure) for exchange controls is a “healthy” measure. On the contrary,
                            such a move lends credence to allegations that Japan has, in fact, been
                            using its exchange controls for protectionist, rather than balance of
                            payments, purposes.</item>

                        <item>Throughout the life of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, in
                            the face of extensive withdrawals by other countries, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has managed with considerable difficulty
                            to avoid the use of Article XXVIII except for a few withdrawals for
                            technical reasons. Furthermore, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            has resorted to the escape clause (Article XIX) on only 12 items over
                            the past 25 years. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government is
                            presently subject to great pressure to make withdrawals under Article
                            XXVIII, and its ability to resist this pressure is weakened by every
                            notification of withdrawal received from other countries.</item>

                        <item>These increased domestic pressures have resulted from growing foreign
                            competition and from intense feeling in the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> with respect to import and exchange restrictions imposed
                            by foreign countries on imports from the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>. For example, a vast majority of the 800 briefs
                            submitted, in connection with the forthcoming 1960–61 round of <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> tariff negotiations, to the Committee
                            for Reciprocity Information and the Tariff Commission by representatives

                            lack of reciprocity on the part of other countries. They cite the
                            extensive network of trade restrictions and high tariffs imposed by
                            other countries on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> exports.

                            Japan (the majority of items affected would undoubtedly be Japanese

                        <item>For some time the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has believed in
                            reducing trade barriers of all kinds—whether in the form of tariffs or
                            direct restrictions. We believe that Japan should be even more
                            interested in a worldwide liberal trading system than the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            has reduced its tariffs since 1934 from a 1931–35 average of 50 percent
                            ad valorem to an average of less than 12 percent and is now a moderate
                            tariff country. We are informed that Japan’s tariffs average about 17
                            percent ad valorem. Since this average is calculated on the basis of
                            actual imports, the liberalization of Japan’s import and exchange
                            restrictions would significantly raise this average.</item>

                        <item>For many years the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> made reductions
                            in customs duties with the full realization that it would receive no
                            immediate benefit therefrom because of the exchange controls imposed by
                            Japan and other countries. If these controls are replaced with tariffs
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government will be hard put to
                            avoid withdrawing concessions which are subject to attack by American

                        <item>In the case of Japan the situation is particularly bad because Japan
                            has been much slower than other major trading countries to remove its
                            trade restrictions. Moreover, the American Congress and public are well
                            aware that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is practically the only
                            country that has been willing to accept rapidly increasing imports from
                            Japan. The Ambassador will recall that in 1955 Japan had a multilateral
                            negotiation, which resulted in its adherence to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> by virtue of an arrangement under
                            which the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> gave concessions to third
                            countries to compensate them for concessions which they made to

                        <item>It seems clearly in Japan’s interest to have a reduction of its
                            tariffs in the context of a liberal free world trading policy rather
                            than to face a situation where the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and
                            other countries are reverting to the protectionist policies which

                        <item>In conclusion you may wish to state that the reason for bringing these
                            facts to the Ministry’s attention at this time is to allow the Japanese
                            Government ample opportunity to give them full consideration in
                            determining the future course of its trade policy. Although we
                            understand the domestic political problem which the Japanese Government
                            faces in its effort to accelerate trade liberalization, the Japanese
                            must realize that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government also
                            faces serious domestic political problems in the trade area. Actions on
                            the part of the Japanese Government which give evidence not only of a
                            reluctance to liberalize its present import restrictions but also of a
                            tendency to follow a more protectionist trade policy can only compound
                            the problems which the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government
                            already faces in its efforts to maintain a liberal trade policy. Any
                            serious deterioration of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Japan trade
                            relations would undoubtedly have serious adverse effects upon the

                            <p>“In accordance with the policy expressed in the enabling legislation
                                for the purpose of evaluating the cases submitted to <gloss

                                borne in mind the danger of allowing the national security clause to
                                become a substitute for the ‘escape clause’ of the same Act. Some
                                indication that industries have, in fact, tried to use the national
                                security clause in this way is given by the fact that many of the

                                strategic concepts have greatly reduced or altered current and
                                foreseeable mobilization requirements for the commodities in

                                availability even with reduced domestic production capability are
                                sufficient to meet emergency requirements; and that in view of the
                                above conclusions as to supply and requirements, the possible costs

                        across the board by the Six. The latter think we will be hard pressed to
                        meet their 20% offer.</p>
                    <p>The agricultural policy and programs of the Six will be particularly
                        difficult from the standpoint of the United States and other agriculturally
                        exporting countries. Thus far there appears to be little to give hope that
                        the Six will go far in opening up its market to outside agriculture. This
                        can be the greatest stumbling block to successful tariff negotiations. In
                        this connection <persName corresp="#p_WWE1">Eric Wyndham-White</persName>
                        suggests that it would be helpful if the United States would abandon its
                        blanket waiver for United States agriculture and fall back upon waivers for
                        individual items. Our people privately say they do not need the general
                        waiver for agriculture and that <persName>Eric</persName>’s suggestion has a
                        great deal of merit. As long as the United States has a general waiver for
                        agriculture, the Six can always point to it as a precedent for meeting their
                        agricultural problem. This question might be a suitable one for interagency
                        policy discussion in the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I gather that the underdeveloped countries which are members of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> do not see much for them in the tariff
                        negotiations. While they will be there observing, it is doubtful that they
                        will participate in many negotiations. Their prime interest seems to be
                        finding a way to ease their products into Western Europe, and the
                        agricultural policies pursued by the Six will have an important bearing on
                        the interest of the underdeveloped countries. In a sense, the problem of the
                        underdeveloped <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0306"/>countries is
                        separate from the tariff negotiations as two committees of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> are studying ways and means for
                        increasing trade in agricultural products and other items of interest to
                        those countries.</p>
                    <p>There continues to be considerable uncertainty on the part of a large number
                        of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> countries as to the role which the
                        new <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> will have in trade matters. I
                        believe there is less apprehension about this now than there was during the
                        summer months.</p>
                    <p>Carl Corse, who heads our delegation in Geneva for the tariff negotiations,
                        is well equipped for this job. He is personally acquainted with the key
                        people of most of the delegations and knows how to deal with them. I am not
                        so certain about the makeup of his team for the first phase of the
                        negotiations. It is in a sense largely a new and inexperienced team,
                        somewhat junior to our representation at previous <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> sessions.</p>
                    <p>Carl will need all the help he can get, both from members of his team in
                        Geneva and from Washington. I know he will have stronger support for the
                        second phase of the negotiations as the <gloss target="#t_TAC1">TAC</gloss>
                        plans to move to Geneva to be there on the spot. It remains to be seen
                        whether he will need the assistance of more senior people during the first
                        phase.</p>
                    <p>The most competent all-around person Carl has is Parker Montgomery,<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">Special Assistant to Secretary of State <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName>.</note> who is likely to return
                        to the United States in a few weeks. The loss of Parker would be a serious
                        blow to our Geneva team, and Carl has said to me privately that he hopes a
                        way can be found to keep Parker in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>Some concern may be expressed in Washington over the selection of <persName

                        Tariff Negotiations Conference. I think that we need to defend this choice
                        on the basis that once McKinnon of the Canadian delegation removed himself
                        from consideration, there was no one else of sufficient stature and
                        sufficiently knowledgeable in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        procedure and tariff negotiations to fill the spot.</p>

                    <p>In response to your request of yesterday, I hereby submit the following
                        observations.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the economic relations between the United States and
                        Western Europe it is obvious that in the coming years we will be in great
                        straits to keep our balance of payments in such shape that we can maintain
                        the free convertibility of a hard dollar and stick to a liberal trade
                        policy. We have spent some $80 billion to get the Europeans on the road
                        toward rising productivity, expansion, and hard freely convertible
                        currencies. We have given them since 1948 the last word in our technology
                        free of charge and our industries are investing over there to get more of it
                        to them.</p>
                    <p>The Europeans, particularly the French and the Germans, but also the
                        Belgians, the Swiss, and the Italians, do not fully understand yet that we
                        are in a tough spot and need their cooperation for their own sake and
                        security at least as much as for our own. They do not realize that unless
                        they revise their policies they will drive the U.S. sooner or later to the
                        same tragic situation which led to the collapse of the World Economic
                        Conference in 1933 in London which blew up because the U.S. unilaterally did
                        what Britain had done previously, namely, it devalued the currency. If this
                        should arise again, it would do its part to blow up <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and start the march on the slippery downgrade in the cold
                        war.</p>
                    <p>If this situation shall be corrected and our burden be lightened, it calls
                        for action on both sides, in Europe as well as the U.S.</p>

                            and the combination of French and German agrarian protectionism and
                            “parity policy” for small farmers will proceed very fast unless we stop

                            foreign trade. It must energetically promote its exports, boost the

                            the Europeans increase it, and stop borrowing from the future by holding
                            the line on wages and costs in general.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>If the latest turn in <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> policies cannot be
                        averted by very massive action on our side, we have the best chance that the
                        drive of all U.S. protectionists and all U.S. industries which are on the
                        defensive against tough price competition from all sides (Asia, including
                        Japan and Hong Kong, Great Britain, Continental Europe, Czechoslovakia,
                        etc.) will lead us to a retreat into deliberalization of our foreign trade
                        policy. Shutting the door to U.S. agricultural exports will have a
                        tremendous echo in our industries, particularly all light industries.</p>
                    <p>It seems high time that we open the eyes of the European leaders who can do
                        something about it by speaking much more bluntly and with less delicacy
                        about these hard facts of life and security for the West. Perhaps one ought
                        to say to Messrs. Erhard and Blessing when they come the next days to attend
                        the International Monetary Fund meeting, that if the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                            >EEC</gloss> countries want to do their part to shut their industrial
                        goods out of the U.S. market (as the result of the U.S. internal politics
                        and Congressional developments), all they have to do is to go ahead with
                        their emancipation of their common market for agricultural products and the
                        discrimination against all non-member nations, which include the U.S.</p>
                    <p>I consider this situation as extremely dangerous because it is politically
                        most difficult to unlodge the agricultural interests from their new
                        protectionist position in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> once they
                        have entrenched themselves in it. This is just as much a fact in Continental
                        Europe as it is in the U.S. The European farm organizations, particularly in
                        France and Germany, are past masters in the riot techniques and all sorts of
                        revolutionary pressure group tactics.</p>
                    <p>This is perhaps the last moment for averting the drift into new belligerent
                        agricultural protectionism in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                        countries. It should be utilized. To utilize it requires the abandonment of
                        kid-glove tactfulness and fear of resentment of “dollar diplomacy”, etc. In
                        the best interest of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries
                        themselves, the U.S. should use maximum <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277"

                    <p>659. Following for your information is text press release on wool fabrics
                        tariff to be issued Washington noon November 9. Washington representatives
                        of countries to which you are accredited (except Switzerland) will be
                        informed November 7, but will be strongly urged to guard against public
                        disclosure until November 9.</p>
                    <p>“The Department of State today announced that new tariff rates on certain
                        woolen and worsted woven fabrics will go into effect on January 1, 1961, and
                        replace the present tariff quota system. These rates, described in the
                        attached table, were approved by the President upon recommendation of the
                        interdepartmental Committee on Trade Agreements and the Trade Policy
                        Committee. They have been the subject of negotiations and consultations with
                        the interested supplier countries in accordance with the provisions of
                        Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>
                    <p>At the present time, these fabrics are subject to a compound tariff duty,
                        consisting of a specific duty and ad valorem rates, both of which vary
                        according to the nature of the fabric. The specific duty, which is
                        compensatory for the duty on raw wool, is 37½ cents per pound for most
                        fabrics. This part of the compound duty will remain unchanged. The ad
                        valorem rates presently in effect have since 1956 been subject to a tariff
                        quota under which the rates for most fabrics were 25 percent ad valorem for
                        imports within the quota limits, and 45 percent for imports after the quota
                        was filled. Exceptions were made for certain specialty fabrics which entered
                        at lower rates even after exhaustion of the quota. With the exception of
                        these specialty fabrics, the new ad valorem portion of the duty will be 38
                        percent for fabrics valued over $2.00 per pound, and 76 cents per pound for
                        lower priced fabrics, with a maximum ad valorem limit of 60 percent.</p>
                    <p>The total duty, including the specific rate, resulted in an average incidence
                        in 1959 of 45 percent on all imports. The incidence of the new rates,
                        computed on the basis of 1959 trade data, would be 48 percent for fabrics
                        valued over $2.00 and upwards of 57 percent for lower-priced fabrics.</p>
                    <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0311"/>
                    <p>The operation of the tariff quota system has disrupted normal marketing
                        practices in the woolen goods trade. United States importers, clothing
                        manufacturers, and retailers were faced with many difficulties resulting
                        from the need to place orders far in advance of delivery and from the
                        uncertainty over the applicable tariff rates at the time of importation of
                        the fabric. To correct these difficulties and to provide a solution better
                        suited to the needs of all the parties concerned, the United States agreed
                        in 1959 to enter into negotiations with the interested supplier countries
                        for renegotiation of the so-called ‘Geneva reservation’ under which the
                        tariff quota arrangement was established. These renegotiations have now
                        resulted in the new arrangements described above.</p>
                    <p>A Presidential Proclamation will be issued in due course to give legal effect
                        to the new rates as of January 1, 1961.”</p>

                        strength in the forthcoming tariff conference in Geneva has been seriously
                        impaired by the Tariff Commission’s peril point findings on the products
                        under consideration for possible tariff concessions.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d140fn1">Not found.</note> These findings were sent to you by
                        the Commission on November 27, 1960, as required by law, and have also been
                        made available to the Interdepartmental Committee on Trade Agreements.</p>
                    <p>Because of the careful selectivity exercised in determining the list of
                        products which was published last May, with your approval, for consideration
                        of possible tariff concessions,<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">Regarding this
                            list, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June 13,
                            1960, pp. 968–973.</note> the list represented only 26.3 percent of our
                        total imports in 1959 from the countries with which we contemplate
                        negotiations. The Tariff Commission’s peril point findings are adverse to
                        tariff concessions on products representing one-third of the trade coverage
                        of the list, thus reducing the possible scope of our negotiating ability to
                        only 17.5 percent of our imports from those countries. In the case of some
                        countries, we will be able to offer concessions on less than one percent of
                        our imports from them.</p>
                    <p>Under the circumstances, it will be exceedingly difficult, if at all
                        possible, for us to conclude meaningful agreements with most of the
                        countries with which we expect to negotiate, and with some of them we may
                        not be able to conclude any agreements at all. The reduced bargaining
                        potential with the European Economic Community (<gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                            >EEC</gloss>), where the attrition caused by peril points is nearly 38
                        percent, is particularly serious. Unless the United States is able to induce
                        the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to accept a one-sided agreement—and
                        this is not a possibility to be relied upon—the United States will be unable
                        to take full advantage of the offer already made by the <gloss
                            target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to reduce its common external tariff by 20
                        percent provided adequate reciprocity is offered by other countries in
                        return. There is accordingly a serious risk that we will be unable to
                        accomplish our objective of furthering the interests of the United States by
                        securing the lowest possible level in the new common external tariff of the
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> as well as substantial tariff
                        reductions by other countries.</p>

                    <p>In your memorandum of December fifth concerning the forthcoming tariff
                        conference in Geneva,<note n="1" xml:id="d141fn1"><ref target="#d140"
                                >Document 140</ref>.</note> I was struck by your statement that
                        “Unless the United States is able to induce the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                            >EEC</gloss> to accept a one-sided agreement—and this is not a
                        possibility to be relied upon—the United States will be unable to take full
                        advantage of the offer already made by the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                            >EEC</gloss> to reduce its common external tariff by 20 percent provided
                        adequate reciprocity is offered by other countries in return.”</p>
                    <p>While the phrase “this is not a possibility to be relied upon” is possibly
                        technically correct, it seems to me we ought to put our own current balance
                        of payments situation very strongly before the conferees and make
                        unmistakably clear that we have gotten into this situation through generous
                        and liberal assistance and trading policies. Now it is time for them to do
                        their share, and a failure on their part to do so would bring into question
                        our basic relationships and attitudes toward these problems.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, I wonder whether reduction by the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                            >EEC</gloss> of its common external tariff by 20% is going to amount to
                        anything like a 20% reduction in the individual tariffs its members now
                        maintain toward us.</p>

                        be a strong and effective organization. We regard it as a major mechanism

                                proposed common tariff closely to assure that it is not, on the
                                whole, higher than the national tariffs it is to replace. He also
                                reiterated that U.S. recent and present trading policies should give
                                strong reason to press for a liberal trade policy on the part of the

                    <p>I wish to refer to your memorandum of December 7, 1960<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d143fn1"><ref target="#d141">Document 141</ref>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> was in Paris to attend the 36th
                            Ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Council.</note> which was
                        brought to my attention immediately upon my return from Paris.</p>
                    <p>I am in agreement with the point expressed in your memorandum that it is now
                        desirable for the Europeans to give continuing evidence that they too
                        subscribe to the liberal trading policies which we have followed with mutual
                        benefit to all of us over the past decade. In large measure, this is the
                        basis on which we are about to enter the forthcoming negotiations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> in Geneva. The <gloss
                            target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, in proposing a 20 percent reduction in its
                        common external tariff, has been fully aware of the difficulties we would
                        have in offering adequate reciprocity. With this in mind, the member
                        countries of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> have, on several
                        occasions, indicated that they were prepared to construe a smaller overall
                        tariff reduction on our part as adequate reciprocity for a larger reduction
                        on their part. It is my concern with our inability to make even this
                        essential smaller tariff reduction in the forthcoming negotiations to which
                        my letter of December 5<note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2"><ref target="#d140"
                                >Document 140</ref>.</note> was addressed, for we risk the loss of a
                        larger and significant tariff reduction on the part of the <gloss
                            target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, a reduction which in itself would be of
                        great importance in solving our balance of payments problem by affording
                        better competitive conditions in European markets to American exporters.</p>
                    <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0319"/>
                    <p>You asked whether a 20 percent reduction by the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                            >EEC</gloss> of its common external tariff is going to amount to
                        anything like a 20 percent reduction in the individual tariffs its members
                        now apply to imports from the United States. As you know, the formation of a
                        customs union involves the merging of the national tariffs of individual
                        participants into the single external tariff of the union. This process
                        means that the tariffs of individual members will move both up and down
                        toward the common external tariff.</p>
                    <p>The proposed common tariff is now under negotiation at Geneva to test its
                        conformity with <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> standards, including
                        the requirement that the incidence of the common tariff must not, on the
                        whole, be higher than the national tariffs which it is to replace. In this
                        process, the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> may have to use some part
                        of its offered 20 percent reduction in order to satisfy the United States
                        and other contracting parties that the common tariff is just and equitable
                        in terms of the pre-existing national tariffs. Beyond that point, the extent
                        to which the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> will go toward the full 20
                        percent reduction will depend on the adequacy of the concessions offered to
                        it in the reciprocal negotiations which are to begin early next year. In
                        answer to your specific question, the reduction of the common external
                        tariff by 20 percent could mean that certain high national rates will come
                        down much more in their movement toward the common external tariff than
                        would otherwise be possible. Conversely, certain low national rates will not
                        rise as much as they would if the offered reduction were less.</p>
                    <p>It was for these reasons that I desired to bring directly to your attention
                        the serious impairment of this Government’s bargaining strength resulting
                        from the Tariff Commission’s peril point findings. However, we shall use to
                        the utmost what bargaining strength we have, including appeal to the Common
                        Market nations on the basis of the good-will our assistance to them in the
                        last ten years should have engendered.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> spoke in Philadelphia
                        about foreign investment and economic development as a means to counter the

                        Fund proposal rather than an agreed Staff Committee recommendation to the

                    <p>The Development Loan Fund proposal established a basic distinction between
                        two types of loans, the economic overhead type and the profit-earning
                        type.</p>
                    <p>On the economic overhead type it was proposed to charge interest at a rate
                        that would cover the cost of money to the Treasury, initially 3½ percent,
                        and to review the rate as the cost of money to the Treasury changed. The
                        maximum maturity of these loans would be 40 years, but it was intended to
                        relate the actual maturities to the life of the projects. Repayments could
                        be in either dollars or local currencies, with emphasis on payments in local
                        currency for the earlier maturities, and with a maintenance-of-value clause
                        for loans repayable in local currency.</p>
                    <p>The profit-earning type of loan would in general follow the pattern of
                        Export-Import Bank loans as to interest rates and maturities, and would be
                        repayable either in dollars or local currencies, with a maintenance-of-value
                        clause on loans repayable in local currency. The Development Loan Fund
                        intended to use its authority for various types of participation in
                        earnings, especially with respect to loans repayable in dollars.</p>
                    <p>The Staff Committee discussion had touched on the relationship between the
                        two types of loans, but no definite agency positions had been taken. One
                        point which had been made clear was that the distinction between the two
                        types of loans did not correspond to a distinction between public enterprise
                        and private enterprise in the foreign countries, since in some foreign
                        countries projects regarded in the United States as the profit-earning type
                        may be carried on by public bodies.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> if he
                        cared to comment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said
                        that the objective of the Development Loan Fund on the economic overhead
                        type of loan was to keep interest rates as low as possible while covering
                        the cost of money to the Treasury, in order to be competitive with loan
                        terms offered by Soviet Russia, particularly in loan operations in
                        underdeveloped areas. Moreover it was important to make the loan terms
                        attractive so as to be responsive to the <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291"
                            facs="0323"/>Congressional desire that as high a proportion of the aid
                        program as possible be in the form of loans. He recommended an insertion in
                        the draft action to express the basis for the interest rate for economic
                        overhead loans, namely, that the interest rate cover the cost of money to
                        the Treasury. He added that frequent changes in the interest rate were not
                        contemplated unless the cost of money to the Treasury Department changed
                        markedly, as it had in recent weeks.</p>
                    <p>On loans for the profit-earning type of project, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that there were many complex
                        factors that would need to be considered. For example, some of those loans
                        would be made to private United State enterprises, and therefore care would
                        have to be taken that there was no suggestion of subsidy or preferential
                        treatment. The Development Loan Fund was developing a policy on this type of
                        loan that would lead to the closest possible coordination with the
                        Export-Import Bank. As the Secretary of the Council had already pointed out,
                        the second category of loans was not confined to private enterprise, since
                        in many cases foreign governments engage in enterprises of this type that
                        would be privately undertaken in the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MID1">McIntosh</persName> inquired whether the
                        action should provide for exceptionally low interest rates on economic
                        overhead type loans under unusual circumstances. He thought that in some
                        cases it might be desirable to make such loans at rates as low as 1 or 2
                        percent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that if
                        such exceptional cases arose the Council would consider them; he felt that
                        at the present time it was desirable to get a general policy rule for
                        guidance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMS1">Szymczak</persName> felt that the action
                        should make it clear that United States borrowers under the profit-earning
                        type of projects should either repay in dollars or undertake profit-sharing
                        arrangements. He felt also that the action should specify that the terms and
                        conditions of loans to local development banks should be considered
                        separately by the Council. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        replied that the Development Loan Fund had discussed the question of
                        requiring dollar repayment by U.S. borrowers and in general favored it, and
                        that the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> would probably take convertible
                        debentures in many of these loans. He doubted that it was necessary to
                        specify these points in the action. He continued that the terms of loans to
                        local development banks had not yet been considered by the Development Loan
                        Fund, and that when such terms were formulated they would be referred to the
                        National Advisory Council. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MID1"
                            >McIntosh</persName> commented that the Development Loan Fund did not
                        contemplate lending to wholly-owned United States companies, but would lend
                        to foreign companies in which United States investors had an interest. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> noted that the <gloss
                            target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> might operate in areas where the
                        Export-Import Bank was not interested in lending. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> expressed a preference for avoiding
                        categorical positions on details of the loan operations since the situations
                        would be complex <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0324"/>and could not be
                        fully foreseen. He said that the Council would be kept fully advised of
                        developments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CTB1">Coughran</persName> expressed
                        a preference for keeping the terms of reference broad, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMS1">Szymczak</persName> expressed his agreement on the
                        understanding that his position was fully understood. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that these views would be
                        borne in mind and action inconsistent with them would not be taken without
                        discussion in the Council.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed briefly the question of the use of the guarantee powers
                        of the Development Loan Fund. It was noted that guarantees were not covered
                        in the proposed action, and would need to be considered at a later date.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kearns</persName> said that the Department of
                        Commerce understood the Congressional intent as requiring that the <gloss
                            target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> aid private investment where possible. He
                        felt that the lower interest rate proposed on economic overhead loans would
                        give them a priority over loans to private enterprises. He had in mind
                        primarily native private enterprises in foreign countries, and said it was
                        important to guard against appearing to favor government investment over
                        private investment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MID1">McIntosh</persName>
                        pointed out that if the Development Loan Fund makes loans to private
                        enterprises at 3½ percent it would create problems for commercial banks and
                        for the Export-Import Bank. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said that the Development Loan Fund was not
                        attempting to discriminate against private investment but rather was trying
                        to stimulate it. The <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> would be glad to
                        receive practical suggestions from the Department of Commerce and other
                        agencies on measures to stimulate private enterprise.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFAJ1">Southard</persName> commented that he
                        assumed the economic overhead type of loan would be particularly appropriate
                        for the Development Loan Fund, in view of the fact that Eximbank facilities
                        were available for loans for the profit-earning type of project in most
                        areas. It was noted, however, that the Export-Import Bank does not lend in
                        some areas of the world, and that the Development Loan Fund would not lend
                        for projects for which Export-Import Bank financing would be available.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> referred to recent
                        discussions of the Administration bill which would require that interest
                        paid and charged by Government lending agencies cover both the cost of money
                        and of administration. He said that the view of the Bureau of the Budget was
                        that interest rates on loans repayable in dollars should cover the cost of
                        administration as well as the cost of money to the Treasury. The Bureau
                        therefore would prefer 4 percent to 3½ percent. The Bureau was also
                        concerned that repayment in local currencies would in time lead to a
                        Development Loan Fund consisting entirely of local currencies, and therefore
                        would favor an interest rate of 5 percent on loans repayable in local
                        currencies, to provide an incentive for repayment in dollars.</p>
                    <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0325"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJB1">Baird</persName> said that the Treasury
                        Department felt that the one percent differential provided no real incentive
                        for repayment in dollars. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        agreed that the one percent differential was not effective. He thought the
                        Development Loan Fund would collect some dollars on loans undertaken in
                        countries where other lending agencies would not operate, for example,
                        Taiwan. The <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> might collect interest in
                        dollars and principal in local currency, or the other way around. In
                        countries in which the Export-Import Bank and the International Bank made
                        loans, to require Development Loan Fund loans to be repaid in dollars would
                        reduce the dollar debt service capacity of the borrowing country. Therefore,
                        in those cases the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> would take local
                        currency in repayment in order to keep its position junior to the positions
                        of the Export-Import Bank and the International Bank. Referring to the
                        interest rate bill,<note n="3" xml:id="d146fn3">Not further
                            identified.</note> he noted that the State Department had raised strong
                        objections on foreign policy grounds to making foreign loans subject to the
                        bill. This remained the position of the Department of State. This view had
                        been discussed with legislative leaders, who felt that the Development Loan
                        Fund and other foreign lending institutions should be excepted from the
                        bill, on the ground that the Congress should not tie the hands of the
                        Executive Branch in economic competition with Soviet Russia. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BJB1">Baird</persName> suggested that the President might
                        make exceptions to the bill on foreign policy grounds, perhaps through the
                        National Advisory Council, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> indicated that this might be appropriate, provided
                        the exceptions were broad.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion the Council took the following action
                        (Action No. 1106): <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The National Advisory Council offers no objection to the general
                                terms and conditions proposed for Development Loan Fund loans, as
                                follows: <list>
                                    <item>“(1) On loans for economic overhead-type projects the
                                        interest rate would cover the cost of money to the U.S.
                                        Treasury and would be initially 3½ percent. The rate will be
                                        reviewed from time to time with changes in the cost of money
                                        to the U.S. Treasury. The maximum maturity of the loans
                                        would be 40 years, and the loans would be repayable either

                                        agreements. A maintenance-of-value provision would be
                                        required for loans repayable in local currencies.</item>
                                    <item>“(2) On loans for profit-earning types of projects the
                                        interest rates would be not less than the interest rates on
                                        Export-Import Bank loans for similar projects, and the
                                        maturities would be similar. Loans would be repayable either
                                        in dollars or in local currency as specified in the loan
                                        agreements, with a maintenance-of-value clause required for
                                        loans repayable in local currencies. It is understood that
                                        the Development Loan Fund would use various types of
                                        participating arrangements in some of these loans.”</item>

                        <item>Senator Mike Monroney (D. Okla.)</item>
                        <item>Mrs. Beth Short</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MASM1">Monroney</persName> led off the
                        conversation by saying that the Congress and the country were getting tired
                        of the Mutual Security Program and that the Administration was going to have
                        to use imagination to develop a substitute. He thought the Mutual Security
                        Program was outmoded much the same way that the statue of liberty play was
                        in football. If Bud Wilkinson, the Oklahoma football coach, used today the
                        same play his team was using ten years ago, his team would not be as
                        successful as it is. While the Mutual Security Program had been a good play
                        in its day, it was time to get a new play.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, the Senator suggested that the Department should take a
                        long look at the accumulations of counterpart funds around the world and see
                        if a new project could be developed based on these funds. The Senator was
                        thinking in terms of both counterpart funds left over from the Marshall Plan
                        in Europe and the PL 480<note n="1" xml:id="d147fn1">The Agricultural Trade
                            Development and Assistance Act, July 10, 1954, as amended. (68 Stat.
                            454)</note> funds. He was under the impression that there were
                        substantial amounts of Marshall Plan counterpart funds still lying unused in
                        European banks. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName>
                        questioned this and said it was his impression that the Marshall Plan
                        counterpart funds were substantially used up.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MASM1">Monroney</persName> explained that what
                        he had in mind was the United States taking the lead of calling a “Bretton
                        Woods type” conference to set up a new international organization patterned
                        after the World Bank which would be capitalized by these counterpart funds.
                        These funds would be released by the United States and the various recipient
                        countries to this new organization for this purpose. The organization would
                        then arrange loans on low interest rates (or perhaps no interest for a
                        period of years) to countries which could not qualify for such loans with
                        the World Bank or other public or private lending organizations.</p>

                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MASM1">Monroney</persName> referred to a
                        memorandum which had been sent to him by Assistant Secretary Hill on January
                        16, 1957 (copy of memo and covering letter attached).<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d147fn2">Not found.</note> This memorandum addressed itself to
                        the Senator’s proposal and, in the Senator’s view, dismissed it on the basis
                        of alleged facts which the Senator did not think were correct. He was
                        particularly exercised about the figures shown in this memorandum which he
                        believed to be erroneous and misleading.</p>
                    <p>After rather a lengthy discussion of the Senator’s proposal, Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> concluded the conversation
                        by promising to give it serious study. The Governor thought as a first step
                        the facts and figures in the memorandum referred to should be checked for
                        accuracy and an attempt be made to determine exactly what counterpart funds
                        were presently lying unused in various countries throughout the world.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> reported that the Bureau of
                        the Budget has formal control over keeping track of these funds and should
                        have completed by next week a study which will clear up what funds exist in
                        all the different sources abroad and where they are. Doubt on this point has
                        caused Congressional confusion and uneasiness.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Henderson</persName> stated that he will ask <persName

                        Monday morning and will tell Mann that the <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>
                        area is charged with pulling together all the data on the subject of these
                        funds as it unfolds. In particular, it was the consensus of the meeting that
                        it was essential that <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> provide whatever
                        historical data it has from its own records or from the records of its
                        predecessors which it inherited showing exactly what funds have been
                        released in the past and, where possible, for what purposes.</p>
                    <p>It was further the consensus of the meeting that everyone agreed that serious
                        thought should be given to the setting up of a Free World Economic
                        Development Fund. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> stated
                        that, even if PL 480 funds were not included, there would be enough other
                        funds available to start such a Fund. He suggested that even $100,000,000
                        would get the Fund off to a good start, and doubted the wisdom of making it
                        too big. The Under Secretary felt the impact would be much greater if the
                        Fund were not kept small.</p>
                    <p>There was discussion about putting into this Fund both current funds which
                        exist abroad and future repayments to the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MWB1">Macomber</persName> suggested that if such a
                        Fund is cleared as a matter of policy, the Secretary might publicly launch
                        the idea with a major speech. <persName corresp="#p_MWB1"
                            >Macomber</persName> added that such an idea would do a great deal to
                        convince Congress that we are looking ahead in the foreign aid picture and
                        that perhaps there was an end in sight to large annual appropriations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> emphasized the importance
                        of having long-range credit available such as this would provide.</p>

                        introduced S. Res. 264 proposing the establishment of an International

                        International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. S. Res. 264 also
                        suggested the United States contribute to the Association in conjunction

                    <p>In anticipation of the meeting of the Preparatory Commission established by
                        the United Nations General Assembly to define the organization of the
                        substantive activities of the Special Fund which was voted at the last
                        session to provide technical assistance “in depth”, an interdepartmental
                        working party (State, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, Treasury,
                        Commerce, Agriculture, Labor, HEW, Bu. of Budget) has been developing the
                        U.S. position. The following is a summary of the negotiations that have
                        evolved from the discussion of this group.<note n="1" xml:id="d151fn1"

                        subsequently be incorporated into formal instructions to the U.S.

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I. Fund Organization</hi></p>
                    <p>The Fund would be headed by a Manager with overall responsibility for
                        operations and with sole power to recommend projects for financing to the
                        appropriate <hi rend="italic">intergovernmental body</hi> mentioned below.
                        He would be appointed by the Secretary General and subject to confirmation,
                        perhaps by the Economic and Social Council (the question to be decided is
                        whether he should be an American and, if so, what names to suggest to the
                        Secretary General); the Manager to be assigned by an Advisory Committee
                        composed of the United Nations Secretary General, the President of <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the Executive Chairman of the
                        Technical Assistance Board (which is concerned with operating the present
                        United Nations Technical Assistance Program). Specialized Agencies directly
                        concerned with projects under discussion by the Advisory Committee would
                        participate in such discussions on an ad hoc basis. While the Manager would
                        have a small professional staff, he would utilize existing facilities of the
                        United Nations to the greatest feasible extent, such as those of the
                        Specialized Agencies for making technical appraisals on proposed projects
                        and carrying them out.</p>
                    <p>Both the present United Nations Technical Assistance Program and the Special
                        Fund would be subject to the supervision of a single <hi rend="italic"
                            >intergovernmental body.</hi> (Precisely what the composition and the
                        total <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0332"/>membership of such a body
                        might be, what voting arrangements might apply and whether subcommittees of
                        the intergovernmental body might be established to be concerned with
                        programming activities of the Special Fund of the existing Technical
                        Assistance Program will have to be worked out during the negotiations in the
                        Preparatory Commission.) In any case, as regards the Special Fund, this
                        intergovernmental body would (a) provide general policy guidance on
                        administration and operations (b) be the final authority for the approval of
                        projects recommended for financing by the Manager (c) be responsible for the
                        coordination of the activities of the Special Fund with those of the present
                        technical assistance program. All decisions of this body would require a ⅔
                        vote. (Various compromises will probably by necessary with respect to such
                        points as total membership of the intergovernmental group and the general
                        composition of the membership.)</p>

                            Fund</hi></p>
                    <p>The Fund would undertake projects falling largely in the fields of <hi
                            rend="italic">assessment</hi> of resources and <hi rend="italic"
                            >training</hi> and <hi rend="italic">research</hi>. It might also be
                        authorized to undertake projects designed to provide on a broad regional
                        basis selected fundamental benefits of existing technology that would
                        contribute directly and immediately to the well-being and productivity of
                        individuals in less developed countries, such as the project for world-wide
                        malaria eradication which is currently under way.</p>
                    <p>Within these fields, the Special Fund would undertake projects which cannot
                        now be adequately covered by existing United Nations technical assistance
                        programs which lack the resources to undertake projects requiring
                        substantial amounts of supplies and equipment or which must be sustained for
                        long periods of time. Also, priority would be given to projects that would
                        have the widest possible impact, preferably regional, so that the Fund would
                        concentrate on a relatively few projects at any given time rather than
                        scattering its resources among many small projects as in the case with the
                        existing United Nations technical assistance program. Project approval would
                        be on an ad hoc basis with no <hi rend="italic">prior</hi> allocation of
                        funds to countries or specialized agencies.</p>

                                that the latter at least be maintained at present levels, i.e.,
                                about $30 million.</item>

                            <item>The question of what amount of resources should be available for
                                the Special Fund before it comes into existence. The sum of $5 or

                            <item>The question of the form of contributions to the Special Fund. The
                                view is that a strong effort should be made by the U.S. to get some
                                partial convertibility requirement attached to contributions which
                                otherwise would be made entirely in inconvertible currency.</item>

                            <item>Agriculture is in basic disagreement with the idea of a central
                                fund operated by a strong Manager. For example, they prefer annual
                                allocation of resources by the Special Fund among the various
                                functional fields represented by the Specialized
                                Agencies-Agriculture, Labor, etc, thus assuring each Specialized
                                Agency its “share” of the projects undertaken, rather than having
                                projects selected without regard to this consideration. This
                                reflects a view long held by Agriculture that governmental
                                contributions for United Nations technical assistance activities
                                should be made directly to each of the Specialized Agencies for work
                                in their respective fields.</item>

                            <item>Treasury feels a real push should be made to assure a substantial

                                agencies, including officers sitting for the Department, are dubious
                                as to the political wisdom of precipitating a fight on this issue
                                should informal soundings indicate that such a move would be

                        economic development and the need to pursue it multilaterally. The President

                            <p>The Management of the Bank feels that an increase of 100 per cent in
                                the Bank’s capital is necessary to provide an adequate guarantee
                                fund for Bank operations as projected. The total present capital of
                                the Bank is $10 billion and a 100 per cent increase would amount to
                                $3,175 million in the case of the United States. The tentative plan

                                required to pay up any portion of the increased capital, except in
                                the exceedingly remote contingency of large-scale defaults on <gloss

                                billion would involve 25 per cent payment in gold and, in the case
                                of the United States, Germany, and possibly several other countries,
                                would involve encashment of non-interest-bearing notes during the
                                next few years. The U.S. quota is $2,750 million, which would mean a
                                gold payment of $687 million. It does not seem advisable to seek an
                                increase of this size.</p>

                                proving adequate to convince influential urban middle class groups
                                that their governments are making a success of independence. The
                                results are seen in various adverse trends-which reflect the
                                increasing dissatisfaction of these groups—in pressures for
                                extremist policies, as in Indonesia; in rising resentment against

                                        multi-year <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> financing,
                                        which would (i) capture the imagination of the public and
                                        the Congress (ii) provide a standard around which the Fund’s
                                        friends—in and out of Congress—could rally vigorously, and
                                        (iii) justify unusual steps to focus public and
                                        Congressional attention on the Fund. Such a multi-year
                                        request is also needed to secure the assurance of future
                                        resources required for effective operation of the Fund, and
                                        to make more clear the central role of the <gloss

                                        some public and Congressional confusion has arisen. A
                                        request for multi-year financing would not project higher
                                        expenditure levels than would another annual request; it
                                        would not, therefore, affect the prospect of a budgetary

                            <item>Therefore we should begin to think in terms of a two part package
                                consisting of proposals for the promotion of private investment and
                                long-term <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> financing, which could
                                be submitted to the Congress reasonably early in the session. It
                                would be separate from the Mutual Security presentation, so as not
                                to be overshadowed by that presentation; the DLF, however, would not
                                need to be removed from the Mutual Security Act. The present draft
                                of the President’s Colombo Plan speech<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2"

                                foreshadows such an approach by singling out the promotion of
                                private investment and <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> financing

                                we should, after the Colombo Plan speech has unveiled our intended
                                program in general terms, proceed to Congressional consultation. As
                                a first step, members of the White House and the Department’s staffs
                                could talk with key Congressional leaders to (i) advise them that
                                the <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> discussion at the December
                                budget meeting would place major emphasis on these proposals; (ii)
                                indicate that the President would wish to secure their views as to
                                the best means of securing such multi-year <pb n="310"

                                financing at that meeting. (The possible means of multi-year
                                financing include: borrowing authority, contract authority,
                                multi-year appropriation, and permanent annual appropriation. Our
                                choice among them should be based in considerable part on the views

                        on two questions in particular.</p>
                    <p>The first question was the appropriate repurchase schedule for special
                        drawings which members might seek to obtain relief from the gold payments
                        made in connection with quota increases. The sentiment of the Council was in
                        favor of endeavoring to hold the repayment period to three years, with a
                        possible compromise, if necessary, of a maximum of two one-year
                        extensions.</p>

                        attached particular importance to a quota increase beyond 50 percent for
                        Germany and possibly some other countries. The consensus was that it was
                        important to have a large increase in the German quota, but that it should
                        be linked to reasonable increases in the quotas of a few other countries
                        having special situations.</p>

                    <p>The Council gave preliminary discussion to four related questions concerning
                        guarantee programs. The first was whether in connection with the proposed
                        increase of $500 million in the authority of the International Cooperation
                        Administration to issue investment guarantees it would be desirable to
                        preserve the present 25 percent reserve against new guarantees by seeking
                        new obligational authority of $125 million. Mr.
                            <persName>Schaefer</persName> said that in view of the assets that would
                        accrue to <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> in the event of payment of
                        claims, and in view of the expectation that no large claims would be
                        presented for payment, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was prepared to
                        see the reserve reduced as low as 15 percent. The Treasury expressed concern
                        about diluting the reserves behind outstanding guarantees and about giving
                        Congress the impression that the guarantee program would always be costless.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> indicated that Commerce
                        favored expansion of the investment guarantee program. Mr.
                            <persName>Furth</persName> noted that Chairman Martin was disturbed by
                        any action that would give the impression that the program could be expanded
                        without any cost to the Government. Mr. <persName>Harvey</persName>
                        indicated that the Bureau of the Budget might be opposed to an increase in
                        new obligational authority for guarantees because of its possible effect on
                        the funds requested for the Mutual Security Program.</p>
                    <p>The second question was the continuation of the Development Loan Fund policy
                        of maintaining a reserve of 100 percent against guarantees. Treasury and
                        Export-Import Bank favored continuation of the 100 percent reserve policy.
                        Representatives of other agencies did not express firm views on the matter,
                        but the Department of State did indicate some consideration was being given
                        to a fractional reserve system.</p>
                    <p>The third question was the limitation of interest to be charged by private
                        United States lenders to foreign borrowers on loans covered by full U.S.
                        Government guarantees—e.g., the case of the Development Loan Fund guarantee
                        of a loan by commercial banks to the In-galls-Taiwan Shipbuilding Company

                            1290 was taken at the 272d meeting.</note> Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CTB1">Coughran</persName> said that the Treasury was
                        currently thinking in terms of a maximum one percent spread above the
                        comparable Treasury rate for loans of up to 3 years maturity, with a greater
                        spread to be negotiated in each case for loans above 3 years maturity. The
                            <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> representative feared that a rigid
                        one percent formula would interfere with the <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                            >DLF</gloss> program. It was agreed that the agencies would consult
                        further on this problem.</p>
                    <p>The fourth point concerned a proposed expansion of the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> investment guarantee program by expanding
                        war risk coverage to include risks arising from insurrection and revolution.
                        The consensus was that such extension of the war risk coverage was
                        reasonable, but opposition was expressed by several agencies to any credit
                        guarantees under the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> investment
                        guarantee program.</p>

                    <p>In his State of the Union message, given before a joint session of the

                            >Eisenhower</persName> referred to the Draper Committee’s establishment
                        and to the need to continue international economic development. Regarding
                        the latter, the President requested an increase in the U.S. contribution to
                        the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for
                        Reconstruction and Development, noted U.S. participation in efforts to
                        create an inter-American financial institution, announced he would send the
                        Congress a program to encourage private industry’s participation in foreign
                        economic development, and discussed the Mutual Security Program’s
                        contribution to world health. For text, see <hi rend="italic">American

                    <p>On January 14, Secretary of State <persName>Dulles</persName> testified
                        before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the basic purposes
                        underlying U.S. foreign policy, one of which was “that free nations shall
                        attain a more rapid rate of economic growth, so that their independence will
                        be more secure and vigorous and so that there will be greater opportunities
                        for cultural and spiritual development.” For text, see <hi rend="italic"

                            >Dillon</persName> defined the imperatives of international development
                        in an address before the Foundation for Religious Action in the Social and
                        Civil Order. For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bulletin,</hi> February 2, 1959, pages 165–168.</p>
                    <p>The President sent his budget request for fiscal year 1960 to the Congress on
                        January 19, highlighting several of its features in his transmittal letter.
                        He listed economic development assistance second, noting that the success of
                        newly independent nations to improve their economic and social status was
                        “vital not only to the freedom and <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0347"
                        />well-being of the millions of people within their boundaries but also to
                        the population of the entire world.” Eisenhower therefore recommended the
                        United States increase its <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> subscriptions, enact a supplemental

                        the Mutual Security Program’s emphasis on economic development, and enact
                        legislation to expand the mutual security investment guaranty program. For

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> reiterated the President’s
                        comments in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
                        January 21, when he also emphasized the need to stimulate economic
                        development through private investment in order to counter the Soviet
                        economic offensive. Text of his statement is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.,

                    <p>In a discussion with the Secretary re the World Bank and International
                        Monetary Fund on January 23, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said that they would be ready to send the proposed
                        increases on this to the Congress early in February. He said he had sent to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD1">Paarlberg</persName>, with the request that
                        it also be sent here, the legislation and accompanying draft letter for the
                        President to send. He said the idea would be to play up this legislation to
                        keep the initiative we had shown at New Delhi. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he understood that there was
                        a feeling by some in the Bureau of the Budget and on the White House staff
                        that this should be handled as a supplemental appropriation with the
                        President sending up “one line” on it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said he did not have strong feelings on it, but
                        noted that he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> would
                        have to testify <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0348"/>on it and it seemed
                        that we would lose if we treated it as an ordinary supplemental. Before
                        taking a stand, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he
                        wanted to be governed by the Secretary’s views.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he felt this was an opportunity that should not be missed
                        to put forward something constructive. There were complaints that our
                        leadership was not sufficiently constructive and imaginative and here was an
                        important opportunity to do something. He pointed out that from a foreign
                        policy point of view this would clearly be to our good. The Secretary said
                        he would reinforce what he had just said and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said he might call on him to do that.</p>

                        Treasury endeavor to reach agreed positions on the various proposals for the

                            <persName>Buffington</persName> of the Treasury tax staff, the
                        conclusions of the meeting can be summarized informally as follows:</p>
                    <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0350"/>

                            Corporation (<gloss target="#t_FBC1">FBC</gloss>) Device</hi></p>
                    <p>It was agreed that this proposal had merit and deserved further
                        consideration. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        expressed concern at the potential revenue loss, particularly if income from
                        exports is eligible for deferral treatment, in whole or in part.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d165fn1">There was little opportunity to discuss the effect of
                            the exclusion in both the <persName corresp="#p_SRI1">Straus</persName>

                            of companies deriving more than half of their income from exports—i.e.
                            in eliminating export companies and reducing the revenue impact.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> He felt that the tax deferral
                        proposal would have some impact on the budget, perhaps enough to unbalance
                        it, and asked his staff to prepare an estimate of the revenue impact.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> suggested that few
                        companies would be able to organize <gloss target="#t_FBC1">FBC</gloss>’s
                        immediately, so that the revenue impact on the present year’s budget would
                        probably be slight. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SFCJ1"
                            >Scribner</persName> remarked that, even so, one should have an estimate
                        of the possible budgetary impact in later years.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> asked whether the
                        tax benefit could be limited to new investment only, to which Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> replied that such
                        discrimination would be unconstitutional in his opinion.</p>
                    <p>The Treasury representatives expressed a preference for taxing the <gloss

                    <p>The Treasury representatives agreed that the tax-free transfer of assets to

                        presumably not to foreign corporations as proposed by the Boechenstein
                        Committee.</p>
                    <p>The Treasury representatives agreed that the <gloss target="#t_FBC1"
                            >FBC</gloss> should have the option of the over-all limitation on

                            Losses</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Lindsay</persName> said that the recommendation for treating
                        foreign capital losses as ordinary losses for tax purposes could involve
                        significant revenue losses, particularly because the domestic tax base of
                        the taxpayer would be affected. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> felt that this recommendation had merit if it could
                        be limited so as to avoid abuse by providing, for example, that it was
                        restricted to capital loss incurred during the first five years of an
                        investment. He felt that this proposal should be thoroughly considered as it
                        gave promise of providing an effective incentive.</p>

                            Banks</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Lindsay</persName> referred to the complexity of legislation
                        designed to defer the tax on foreign branches, and felt that its inclusion
                        in a tax bill might jeopardize the bill as a whole. He was skeptical,
                        therefore, of a special arrangement for branch banks abroad and wondered how
                        much effect such a special arrangement would have on the willingness of
                        American banks to extend their foreign operations. I pointed out that
                        several banks had attached some importance to this matter, although I could
                        not confirm that their expansion abroad would be greatly enhanced by the
                        treatment suggested. It was agreed that the Treasury would consult
                        representatives of banks operating abroad and banks which were becoming more
                        interested in foreign operations, and that this matter would be considered
                        further on the basis of such conversations.</p>

                        interpretation of such taxes had raised difficult problems in some cases. He
                        agreed that it probably could not be dealt with by legislation but hoped
                        that it could be handled more effectively in treaty negotiations. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> asked his staff to take
                        another look at this problem to see what further might be done.</p>

                        sparing provisions in tax treaties, and doubted the efficacy of handling tax

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Lindsay</persName> reported that he had talked again with
                        representatives of some of the investment companies about passing through
                        foreign tax credits to their shareholders. They felt the administrative
                        problems were difficult and that, in most cases, the amount of credit was
                        too small to be meaningful. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said this was not one of the most important
                        recommendations, and it was clear that an investment company established
                        primarily to invest abroad could pass through its foreign tax credit under
                        existing law.</p>

                        be treated as ordinary losses under present law, so he saw no need for

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Lindsay</persName> felt that tax deferral for technical
                        services invested in return for stock in a foreign company, particularly
                        where those services might be rendered in the United States, would
                        constitute a difficult precedent and does affect the domestic tax base.
                        Little was said about the similar investment of property although it seemed
                        to present a less difficult problem for the Treasury which would give it
                        further study.</p>

                        seemed to offer opportunities for abuse. The release of the guaranty and the
                        return of the reserve to taxable income could be timed, for example, to
                        occur when most advantageous to the taxpayer. Mr. <persName

                        March, and thus would not be in a position to take up the Boggs Bill or any
                        Administration proposals regarding taxation of foreign investment until
                        after that date. He suggested that, tactically, it would be advisable for
                        the Administration’s proposals to be prepared in the form of a report upon
                        the Boggs Bill. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said this

                        recommended the Congress adopt the bill, noting: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“For many years the Committee on Foreign Relations has urged the
                                administration to do its utmost to utilize private capital for
                                promoting economic development abroad. It has also urged that
                                independent nations endeavor to stabilize their currencies so that
                                world trade may thereby be encouraged.</p>
                            <p>“The International Bank and Monetary Fund are international
                                institutions which have encouraged the flow of private capital into
                                developmental projects and promoted monetary stability. As
                                international institutions they not only have served the financial
                                needs of the international community, but have acted as educational
                                institutions, often capable of promoting sound financial practices

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> outlined the U.S.
                        position stating that he saw in the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> the
                        only really effective counter to the movement toward some sort of <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> activity in this field such as <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, and also a useful means of providing
                        some check on the appetite of the underdeveloped countries for soft loans.
                        This check would operate through the requirement that the underdeveloped
                        countries put up a certain amount of capital in convertible currencies.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then said he had
                        in mind that each country would put up maybe 10% to 15% of the capital in
                        gold and the rest in convertible currency of one <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323"
                            facs="0355"/>sort or another, and that the stock holdings of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> should be roughly in accord with those of
                        the World Bank. He said the U.S. might want to put in some of our own local
                        currency in addition in the form of non-voting stock.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister indicated sympathy for the basic idea of <gloss
                            target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> and inquired as to our views regarding the
                        size of the institution and the length of time it would take to expend its
                        funds. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that
                        as a very preliminary guess he was thinking of something on the order of
                        about $1 billion capital and said that it would probably take some time to
                        utilize its funds. He did say, however, that it would probably be necessary
                        to have a replenishment of <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>’s convertible
                        funds from time to time.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that what the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was
                        really interested in was not so much the size of their subscription as the
                        amount of funds that were drawn down from year to year and the effect of
                        this on their balance of payments. Both the Prime Minister and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> were in full accord that
                        the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> should be operated as an adjunct or
                        subsidiary of the World Bank, with the same officers and staff as the World
                        Bank. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> expressed a
                        desire to talk in further detail about the IDA with the Chancellor of the
                        Exchequer. He said there was some problem in finding a way of their getting
                        together without too much publicity. It was agreed by all concerned that
                        such a meeting would be desirable. The British suggested that it might take
                        place if Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> found it
                        convenient sometime late in May when there was an important meeting
                        scheduled in England of American business people.</p>
                    <p>After the meeting broke up, Selwyn Lloyd told me that he was a great backer
                        of this idea within the British Cabinet. He said that the one chief concern
                        that he had was that this was somehow tied in with our program for disposal
                        of agricultural surpluses and would be in effect a means by which we would
                        hope to dispose of larger amounts of agricultural surpluses. This, he said,
                        was the problem with the Commonwealth countries. I reassured him that this
                        was not the case at all, and that our idea of contributing local currencies
                        to this institution was merely to make use of them wherever the World Bank
                        might find them useful, and there would be no attempt to force these
                        currencies on the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>, or to use the <gloss

                        program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he was
                        reassured to hear this as it had given the British cause for concern.</p>

                    <p>The question of a supplemental appropriation for the Development Loan Fund
                        rose at a legislative leadership meeting held at the White House the morning
                        of March 24. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had
                        asked the Congress for an additional $225 million for the Fund in his
                        January 19 budget request for fiscal year 1960 (see <ref target="#d162"
                            >Document 162</ref>), and again in his March 13 Mutual Security request
                        (see <ref target="#d234">Document 234</ref>). At the leadership meeting,
                        Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        “stated the urgent need for a supplemental appropriation since the presently
                        available funds are, in effect, obligated although the technical definition
                        of ‘obligated’ will not be fulfilled until detailed agreements are signed in
                        subsequent months. However, he said, the full faith of the United States is
                        already at stake as a result of preliminary commitments. Messrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HBN1">Harlow</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                            >Taber</persName> stressed the need for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> to make available current information adequate to
                        refute Mr. <persName corresp="#p_POE1">Passman</persName>’s allegations
                        about the vast sums available. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                            >Taber</persName> believed the House could not be induced to approve
                        more than $100 million for the supplemental ($225 million requested) but
                        that the Senate might accomplish an increase.” (Notes on Legislative

                    <p>The Council considered the question of appropriate policy toward more active
                        use of repayment guaranties by the U.S. Government (<gloss target="#t_NAC1"

                        The Chairman said that it was important to exercise the guaranty authority
                        in the soundest possible manner. He noted that the Export-Import Bank
                        already had authority to make repayment guaranties and that this authority
                        had not been used extensively in recent years, largely because of the need
                        of coordination with Treasury financing operations. The Chairman added that
                        the Bank had had remarkable success in developing the export of capital with
                        private participation. He referred to the studies and reports which had been
                        prepared under the direction of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                            >Boeschenstein</persName> and Mr. <hi rend="italic">Straus</hi>, and
                        felt that the U.S. Government would enlarge its activities in this area. He
                        believed that such enlarged use of repayment guaranties should be
                        accomplished through the Export-Import Bank, which already had the necessary
                        experience and the available funds. He saw an advantage from the point of
                        view of the State Department in having this done by the Export-Import Bank,
                        since the seeking of new funds or new authority for repayment guaranties
                        might operate to reduce the availability of other foreign aid funds.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> noted that in the years 1952
                        to 1958 private participation without the guaranty of the Export-Import Bank
                        in projects partially financed by the Bank totaled about $884,000,000. In
                        addition he noted that all Cooley Amendment loans made thus far had carried
                        with them private U.S. capital. Private capital participated in projects
                        financed by the Bank both by direct investment and by purchase of the Bank’s
                        loan paper without recourse on the Bank. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1"
                            >Waugh</persName> said that the Bank was anxious to assist in
                        facilitating the movement of private capital abroad, and was not holding
                        back on guaranties, but had been cooperating with the Treasury
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SMS1">Szymczak</persName> said that the
                        Federal Reserve Bank favored expanding the guaranty program through the
                        Export-Import Bank, especially in view of the United States
                        balance-of-payments position and in view of the Treasury financing and
                        public debt problem. He <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0358"/>referred
                        also to the wide contacts and experience of the Bank, and its considerable
                        success in facilitating the movement of private capital abroad, with or
                        without the guaranty of the Bank.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Fisk</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2">Bradley Fisk,
                            Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for International Affairs.</note>
                        said that the Department of Commerce felt that the existing authority of the
                        Export-Import Bank and the Development Loan Fund were sufficient for an
                        expanded guaranty program, and that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> thought it would not be wise to seek new legislative
                        action at this time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented that there was a
                        considerable amount of Congressional pressure for a program of increasing
                        private investment abroad, and that the key question appeared to be that of
                        providing a new stimulus. He noted that the Export-Import Bank guaranty
                        authority had been relatively unused, and expressed doubt that the Bank’s
                        efforts to obtain private capital participation had been of much effect in
                        certain underdeveloped areas, such as South Asia. There was a general
                        feeling that the United States should do more in such areas than it had been
                        doing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> added that he had
                        no strong views on which agency of the Government should undertake the task,
                        and that he was not opposed to increased use of the guaranty authority of
                        the Export-Import Bank. He noted, however, that Export-Import Bank
                        guaranties would be tied, and that there was a possibility that increased
                        use of the Export-Import Bank guaranty authority would reduce the amount of
                        private participation in Export-Import Bank loans without guaranty by the
                        Bank.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> suggested, as a possible
                        alternative to using the Export-Import Bank’s authority, the broadening of
                        the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> investment guaranty authority to
                        encompass repayment guaranties. No additional funds would be needed beyond
                        the previously contemplated increase of $500 million in the authority to
                        issue guaranties, and a limit could be placed on the amount of repayment
                        guaranties, possibly as low as $100 million. If this were approved, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> would contemplate
                        administrative action to require the Development Loan Fund to approve any
                        repayment guaranties, since the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                        investment guaranty staff were not trained in appraising loans. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> concluded, however, that
                        he would support more active use of the Export-Import Bank’s guaranty
                        authority if this approach would be likely to work.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> commented that from the
                        management standpoint it appeared preferable to utilize existing authority
                        and staff in the Export-Import Bank and the Development Loan Fund rather
                        than to seek new legislation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> commented he was not sure
                        that the Congressional advocates of increased private investment were aware
                        of the amount of private investment going abroad in association with
                        Export-Import <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0359"/>Bank loans. He felt
                        that the balance-of-payments aspect was a serious matter which should be
                        taken into account, and he noted that the existing policy of the Bank on
                        guaranties had not been decided by the Bank alone but had been developed in
                        response to the needs of Treasury financing policy. Mr.
                            <persName>Arey</persName> also noted the close tie between Export-Import
                        Bank dollar loans and loans of Cooley Amendment funds, and said that in many
                        cases it was possible to work out financing which would use both types of
                        funds.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that if the Bank would
                        be able to do an effective job it would be appropriate to try this avenue.
                        He suggested that the Bank might differentiate as between areas in which it
                        would be willing to give guaranties, and noted that the use of the Bank’s
                        authority would be more likely to be successful if it became generally known
                        that the Bank was ready to operate in new areas of the world.</p>
                    <p>(At this point the Chairman left the meeting, and the chair was assumed by
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJB1">Baird</persName> as Acting Chairman.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJB1">Baird</persName> (Acting Chairman) expressed
                        the consensus as being that it was appropriate for the U.S. Government to
                        try some increased use of guaranties; and that the Export-Import Bank was
                        the appropriate channel for this effort. It was also agreed that the
                        interest rate aspects of guaranteed loans should be explored further by the
                        Staff Committee; also that the Staff Committee would prepare an action which
                        would record the decision of the Council that as a matter of principle the
                        use of guaranties by the Export-Import Bank should be expanded. (The text of
                        the Council action is as follows (<gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Action
                        59–101)): <quote rend="blockquote">

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> informed the Council that
                        the Export-Import Bank was considering the issuance of transfer guaranties,
                        and was thinking in this connection of charging a rate of ½ percent per
                        year. He expressed the hope that information on the performance of the Bank

                            >Eisenhower</persName> commented favorably on a proposal by Senator

                        billion a year for 5 years for the Development Loan Fund. Eisenhower also
                        noted that he accepted the principle of long-range commitment and believed

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> next referred to proposals
                        and questions regarding the Development Loan Fund, and specifically to
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>’s suggestion for a
                        five-year commitment of $1.5 billion per year, with the Fund to be financed
                        like the Export-Import Bank. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said that he had told the Congress the Administration
                        had planned to raise the matter next year, with another year’s experience to
                        draw upon. When pressed he had said that State favored the proposal,
                        although he could not say what the Administration position would be. Now,
                        however, he has reached agreement with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                            >Stans</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> on taking a position generally as follows: The
                        President does not take a position on proposals not in his program until the
                        specific legislation comes before him; however, on the basic idea of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> suggestion the
                        Administration favors the long-range basis for the Development Loan Fund,
                        and would have no objection to the appropriation of $1.5 billion for it, it
                        being clearly understood that there is no commitment that that amount would
                        be expended each year.</p>
                    <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0361"/>
                    <p>The President said his idea on the Development Loan Fund would be for an
                        amount of approximately $5 billion in “no year” money constituting a
                        revolving fund. The Executive Branch would advise Congress each year how
                        much it planned to spend, and also what their projection would be for the
                        following year.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he viewed foreign development not primarily as
                        competition for the United States, but as the building up of markets,
                        standards of living and foreign wage levels, all of which would increase the
                        demand for U.S. products and reduce the wage differentials as between the
                        U.S. and foreign labor. He thought the Development Loan Fund should be made
                        a regular banking program. He recognized that there is one difficult point,
                        in that we now prefer not to finance it by selling bonds to the Treasury,
                        although this was our proposal two years ago. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said we can simply report that we
                        have changed our minds on this. He added that he thought a proposal along
                        these lines should be made next year if the <persName corresp="#p_FJW1"
                            >Fulbright</persName> proposals do not go through during this Congress
                        and the President indicated agreement.</p>

                        his proposals for financing the Development Loan Fund. “I see little
                        likelihood of acceptance by the Congress of these amendments,” <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> wrote, “unless you and your
                        Administration give them your full, unqualified support.” For text, see

                    <p>Eisenhower was asked at a June 3 press conference about <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>’s suggestion that the Development
                        Loan Fund be authorized to borrow from the Department of the Treasury to
                        ensure its long-term funding. He replied that he opposed the Federal
                        government’s borrowing funds except in a great emergency, but did support
                        giving the Development Loan Fund the authority to make long-term
                        commitments. The means for making such commitments, however, would <pb
                            n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0362"/>have to be approved by the
                        Appropriations Committee. For text of his comments, see <hi rend="italic"

                        430.</p>
                    <p>The following day, the President stated in a letter to <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> that he hesitated to increase the
                        Development Loan Fund’s appropriation, since he hoped that other nations
                        would increase their financing for the less-developed areas as their own
                        economies improved. Eisenhower also reiterated his opposition to empowering
                        the Fund to borrow from the Treasury, asserting that “our common objective
                        can best be accomplished through a long-term authorization of appropriations
                        in reasonable amounts, together with the concurrent enactment in one
                        appropriation bill of appropriations for each of the years for which the
                        program is authorized—a specified appropriation for each year, each
                        appropriation to remain available until expended.”</p>
                    <p>This would not give the Fund the flexibility of the Export-Import Bank and
                        the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, but should enable
                        it “to put its operations on a satisfactory long-term basis.” (<hi

                    <p>On June 10, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee adopted an amendment to
                        the fiscal year 1960 Mutual Security legislation authorizing the Development
                        Loan Fund to borrow $1 billion a year from the Treasury for 5 years. The
                        Committee reported the bill, S. 1451, with this amendment on June 22.

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that in its
                        essentials the problem was simple. It was a matter of finding the means of
                        financing aid to these nations without doing violence to our financial
                        traditions and principles. He feared that the Treasury Department was
                        strongly opposed to providing aid on a multi-year basis.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> inquired whether
                        the Soviet economic assistance to India took the form of loans or of grant
                        aid? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that
                        most of the assistance provided by the Soviet Union to India was in the form
                        of loans but he warned that the Soviet Government could be flexible if need
                        be, as had been demonstrated by its grant aid to Nepal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> inquired whether it would be
                        possible for the U.S. to undertake to provide aid to India on a multi-year
                        basis without being obliged to use similar methods in other areas of the
                        world and most particularly in Latin America. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that such a course of action
                        was possible and seemed to imply a preference for the provision of aid on a
                        multi-year basis as opposed to providing aid on a year by year basis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then suggested that it was
                        perhaps unwise for the Council to pursue this issue in the absence of the
                        President and said he would try to undertake to have the Planning Board
                        frame the issue in clearer form.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> warned that we needed
                        a decision in the matter of legislative authority for provision of aid on a
                        multi-year basis in order to respond to Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1"
                            >Fulbright</persName>’s position on the Hill. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName>, however, insisted that there was
                        more to the problem than a simple decision as to whether the U.S. was going
                        to provide assistance to other nations on a year by year basis or over a
                        longer range of time. The fundamental problem in Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName>’ view was whether we would resort to
                        “backdoor financing.” This, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                            >Stans</persName>, is what Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1"
                            >Fulbright</persName> was advocating. He would authorize extension of
                        aid on a multi-year basis but Congress would appropriate money only on a
                        year by year basis with the results, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                            >Stans</persName>, that we would have to go to the Treasury to get the
                        money needed to carry out our commitments. In short, how do we commit
                        ourselves to a long-range aid program without at the same time getting from
                        Congress long-range appropriations? This was the major problem that had to
                        be resolved.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> also said that there was yet
                        another problem in connection with the extension of long-range aid. Were we
                        to deal with multi-year programs through the medium of existing institutions
                        or were we to create other institutions for this purpose? He felt that a
                        discussion of these problems in the NSC Planning Board or elsewhere should
                        be used to develop these points before they are brought back to the <gloss

                    <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0364"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> expressed the opinion that the
                        kind of questions posed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName>
                        were not appropriate for solution in the Planning Board or in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> itself. These questions involved techniques
                        rather than policy. The real problem, as it appeared to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, was what policy differences existed

                            <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> would bring these matters up
                        at a later meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> replied
                        that he intended to do so but not in the form of further consideration of
                        the Discussion Paper but as part of a revised statement of policy on South
                        Asia which would presumably contain split views.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFCJ1">Scribner</persName> said he had a question
                        to put to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>. Was it
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s thought that we
                        should now depart from our policy, with respect to foreign aid, of trying to
                        find aid projects which seemed promising, and instead shift to some kind of
                        general assistance project which really amounted to nothing more than
                        pumping a certain amount of money into a country like India regardless of
                        how it was to be spent? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> denied any intention to move in this latter direction
                        and said he fully agreed with the Treasury on the need to come to an
                        agreement with India with respect to the projects for which the U.S. would
                        provide financial assistance.</p>

                            Gaulle</persName> made a speech in which he called for a large joint
                        East-West program of multilateral assistance to underdeveloped countries. He
                        also indicated that he intended to discuss this question at a future summit
                        conference should the foreign ministers meeting produce sufficient accord to
                        result in a summit meeting. Although <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de

                        aroused considerable interest throughout the world. It is still not exactly
                        clear what he had in mind, but apparently he was motivated by two
                        objectives. He feels keenly the obligation of economically mature countries
                        to assist the underdeveloped areas and he believed such a move would provide
                        initiative for the free world and place the Soviet Union on the defensive,
                        as he is convinced the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not
                        accept this challenge to peaceful cooperation.</p>

                            Western-Soviet Aid</hi> After carefully considering the matter, the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> reached the conclusion that it would
                        be contrary to Western interests for the West to take the initiative in
                        proposing joint Soviet-Western participation in aid to the less-developed
                        countries. This would contribute to the successful pursuit of the Soviet
                        economic offensive, which is an essential element of Soviet strategy for
                        undermining the West. That this economic offensive plays a key <pb n="334"
                            xml:id="pg_334" facs="0366"/>role in furthering Soviet political
                        objectives in the less-developed areas has been confirmed to us from many
                        sources, and it is clear that the offensive is being pressed with increasing
                        vigor.</p>
                    <p>Western endorsement of Soviet participation in economic development of the
                        less-developed countries would immediately give the Soviet Union an
                        important propaganda opportunity. It would be used to demonstrate that the
                        West regards the Soviets as a worthy and important contributor to the future
                        of underdeveloped areas and would destroy the effect of the warnings which
                        have been given by several Western powers to these countries as to the
                        dangers of becoming too heavily involved with Soviet assistance.</p>
                    <p>We have considered the possible argument that the Soviet economic offensive
                        would be less dangerous if it were channeled through a multilateral program
                        with Western participation rather than through the present Soviet bilateral
                        programs. We believe it certain, however, that the Soviets would refuse to
                        participate in any possibility of Western control over Soviet activities.
                        Furthermore, even if the Soviets participated in limited arrangements or in
                        selected areas to which they have not secured access previously, this
                        participation would not mean the abandonment or lessening of their bilateral
                        programs. We are also sure, from past experience in <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> and elsewhere, that in any
                        multilateral program involving Soviet participation the Soviets would make
                        every effort to penetrate or otherwise influence the operations of the
                        organization to further Soviet political objectives. Among other things,
                        they would insist on full membership for the satellites, use the forum for
                        creating propaganda against Western Europe and the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>, and advance unsound economic policies having great appeal
                        in underdeveloped areas. They would also seek prominent representation on
                        the technical staff and secretariat and in the field of technical
                        assistance, where they are capable of delivering competent technicians on a
                        larger scale and with greater despatch than many Western governments.
                        Through these channels they would certainly seek to influence the
                        governments of less-developed areas in the direction of communist economic
                        methods. In short, competition between the Soviets and the West for the
                        favor of the less-developed areas would be intensified and East-West
                        frictions would be increased.</p>
                    <p>We have also considered and agree with the argument it is unlikely that the
                        Soviets would agree to a multilateral assistance program or organization
                        with provisions and safeguards acceptable to the West. However, this fact
                        would not deny them the opportunity to obtain great propaganda advantage
                        from a Western proposal. The most likely course of events would be that the
                        Soviets, while not rejecting a Western proposal in principle would introduce
                        modifications highly appealing to the less-developed countries but
                        unacceptable to the <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0367"/>West. Failure
                        of the project would thus be blamed on the West, with the Soviets appearing
                        as the champions of the less-developed countries.</p>
                    <p>Even graver is the possibility of the damage that might be done to practical
                        efforts which the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and other Western
                        governments are now making to obtain sufficient capital for helping the
                        less-developed countries. Soviet attempts to undermine the economic
                        structure of the free world and to subvert the governments of the weaker
                        nations have been an important factor in motivating Western legislatures to
                        support development assistance programs in the underdeveloped areas. A
                        proposal now to collaborate with the Soviets on such aid could well weaken
                        public support in the West for development funds to help the less-developed
                        areas. Such a result would be a major victory for the Soviet Union.</p>

                        issues in the struggle for freedom. We are convinced, however, that the
                        interests of the West can be advanced on this front only through a greater
                        concerted effort among the free world countries themselves.</p>
                    <p>It is for this reason that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is proposing
                        that consideration should be given to the establishment of a new
                        International Development Association (<gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>)
                        whose purpose would be to provide additional capital for the development of
                        the less-developed areas, on flexible terms, and in a manner which would
                        supplement the newly increased resources of the World Bank and of bilateral
                        and regional programs of the Western governments.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> paper as made available to <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> member countries, and which is now the
                        basis of discussion with some other countries, envisages <gloss

                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, therefore benefiting from the same
                        effective management the latter has enjoyed. Membership in <gloss
                            target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> would be open to all members of the World
                        Bank, and voting in the organization would be on a weighted basis, assuring
                        adequate influence by contributing members. <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> thinking is that the initial capital should be $1 billion,
                        with provision for considering increases in the capital at five-year
                        intervals. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> subscription would be
                        proportional to its subscription in the International Bank, taking into
                        account the proposed increases in the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>.
                        If the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> is set up with the capitalization
                        we envisage, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> share would amount to
                        about $320 million. <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> should also have the

                        which should, we believe, be convertible on demand unless <gloss

                        which would, as a minimum, be usable for procurement of nationally produced

                            >US</gloss> would do the same with this portion of its subscription.
                        Also, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> believes arrangements should be
                        made to permit the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> to accept special
                        contributions from one member in the currency of another member. Transfers
                        by members of portions of existing accumulations of local currencies should
                        not be on terms which impose greater restrictions on the use of the currency
                        by <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> than previously applied to its use by
                        the donor country. We believe that efforts should be made to secure
                        agreement of member countries, in accepting the <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss> charter, to cooperate in facilitating reasonable transfers
                        to <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> of its currency which another country
                        wished to contribute.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> believes that Western
                        interests can be advanced effectively in the field of multilateral aid to
                        underdeveloped countries through cooperative Western arrangements such as
                        the proposed International Development Association, but that a Western
                        proposal for joint Soviet-Western participation in such aid, implying
                        endorsement by the West of Soviet aid, would be dangerous to the interests
                        of the West.</p>

                    <p>During floor action on fiscal year 1960 Mutual Security legislation, the
                        Senate rejected Senator <hi rend="italic">Fulbright</hi>’s proposals,
                        contained in S. 1451, to provide the Development Loan Fund with multiyear
                        financing by empowering it to borrow from the Department of the Treasury.
                        The Senate instead voted on July 2 to authorize $750 million for the Fund in
                        fiscal year 1960 and $1.25 billion in fiscal year 1961, to be available only
                        in an appropriation bill. These provisions remained in the final version of
                        the bill which the Senate passed July 8, H.R. 7500. See <ref target="#d245"

                            >ICA</gloss> policy has been that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        should not in general directly assist foreign countries to increase
                        production of surplus agriculture commodities so as to result over a
                        reasonable period of time in increased exports or decreased imports of such
                        commodities. While exceptions in this policy were made, the presumption was
                        against such aid and the burden of proof of the necessity for an exception
                        was on the initiator of such a project to increase the production of a
                        surplus commodity. USOM’s were instructed to give the most careful
                        consideration to this policy decision in framing their yearly projects. Any
                        decision to support or to continue to support such an activity had to be
                        based on a written justification, and exceptions were <pb n="338"
                            xml:id="pg_338" facs="0370"/>allowed only when it appeared that it was
                        in the over-all best interests of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.
                        Furthermore, no such decision would be supported by the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> until it was proved that the production of
                        the surplus commodity would be increased on a sound economic basis for the
                        purpose of increasing domestic consumption or maintaining domestic
                        consumption at least at subsistence levels and that no practical means
                        existed of increasing imports of surplus commodities from the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or other friendly exporting countries. This
                        policy was an attempt to carry out <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                        programs of assistance to agricultural development in accordance with
                        certain principles, the purpose of which, insofar as possible, was to
                        reconcile a conflict between <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> surpluses and
                        foreign agricultural programs.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">New Policy</hi> One of the basic foreign policies of the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is to support the progress of free
                        peoples in their efforts to further their economic development and thus to
                        strengthen their freedom. The Department believes that this policy can be
                        implemented by a vigorous program of agricultural development to increase
                        production capacities in underdeveloped areas and hence suggested the policy
                        revision.</p>
                    <p>Under the revised policy, subject to normal programming procedures, <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid of any kind may be provided to a country
                        for the purpose of increasing the production of food and feeds for domestic
                        consumption. Such aid, however, may not be given to increase the production
                        of surplus foods and feeds so as to result in substantially increasing
                        exports or increasing production of surplus agricultural commodities other
                        than food and feeds. It is the responsibility of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> proposing such a project to assure that
                        the assistance to be rendered the producing country will in fact be used for
                        production of food for domestic consumption. If it should appear, however,
                        that such assistance will also have the direct effect of substantially
                        increasing the production of a commodity for a purpose for which aid is not
                        permitted under this policy, such assistance would not be extended. If, in
                        the judgment of the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, it is important
                        to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> objectives in the area to support a
                        project of a kind not permitted under this policy, a full written
                        justification should be referred to Washington for consideration by the
                        Director of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> in the light of total <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests.</p>
                    <p>Included under the term “surplus agricultural commodity” are all commodities
                        determined by the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> to be surplus for the
                        purpose of the new policy. Until changed, this term will include the
                        following commodities which have been continuously in world or <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> surplus: rice, sugar, wheat, vegetable oils,
                        citrus fruits, cotton, coffee and tobacco. The term “production of
                        commodities” means the growing, harvesting or processing of the commodity.
                        Thus, for the purpose of the new policy, the term wheat production would
                        include growing <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0371"/>wheat and milling
                        it into flour but not baking it into bread; and cotton production would
                        include growing, harvesting and ginning cotton but not spinning it into
                        textiles.</p>
                    <p>This modest liberalization of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy
                        constitutes an affirmative statement of the importance of assistance to
                        foreign agriculture. It now permits aid, both technical and economic, for
                        the production of food and feeds for domestic consumption even though food
                        imports from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> might so be reduced. It
                        also permits aid for the production of food and feeds even though, as a
                        result, exports of food and feeds might be increased provided that such an
                        increase is not substantial. It invites the <gloss target="#t_USOM1"
                            >USOM</gloss>’s to ask for exceptions where, in their judgment, the
                        restrictions laid down in the policy interfere with the accomplishments of
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> objectives in the area. The practical
                        effect of the new policy in the absence of an exception will be: a) no aid
                        for the production of cotton and tobacco whether for domestic consumption or
                        for export (affected countries include Pakistan, Sudan, <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Brazil and some African countries); b) aid
                        for wheat, rice, sugar, oils, coffee, citrus fruits for domestic consumption
                        or for modest increases in exports; and c) no aid for coffee production in
                        Africa or citrus production in Spain if the result would be substantially to
                        increase exports; and d) no aid to Burmese, Viet-Namese, Korean, Thai,
                        Cambodian, or Formosan rice production if the result would be substantially
                        to increase rice exports.</p>
                    <p>This revised policy will govern all <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> aid
                        to foreign agriculture, whether it is through the use of appropriated funds
                        or local currency receipts from PL–480 sales. It will not, however, govern
                        aid furnished by either the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> or the
                        Eximbank.</p>

                            Actions.</note> The Staff Committee had proposed two alternative
                        amendments to the earlier actions. Alternative A would advise the
                        Export-Import Bank that the appropriate rate for loans of 2 or more years
                        maturity should be at least 5-¾ percent until further review by the Council.
                        Alternative B would in effect suspend for the present the principle of a 2
                        percent differential by providing that rates need not exceed 5-¾ percent
                        until further review by the Council. Under both formulations it was proposed
                        to delete from the earlier actions language relating to loans to governments
                        and to private borrowers. With respect to the Development Loan Fund, the
                        Staff Committee had submitted a draft action<note n="3" xml:id="d179fn3"

                            >185</ref>.</note> which would call for the continuation of the 3-½
                        percent rate on economic overhead loans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UTG1">Upton</persName> said that some weeks earlier
                        the situation had been reached where if rates on Export-Import Bank loans
                        were raised to 6 or 6-¼ percent according to the formula U.S. exports would
                        be made still more costly at a time when we were particularly aware of the
                        need for keeping the U.S. competitive. Similarly, raising the rate on <gloss
                            target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> economic overhead loans to 4 percent would
                        create psychological warfare problems. There was the choice of dropping the
                        formula and establishing an ad hoc rate (Alternative A) or of keeping the
                        formula and agreeing to deviate temporarily from it (Alternative B).</p>
                    <p>However, it was important to continue to work toward a new set of rates that
                        would eliminate some of the present anomalies. At present the <gloss
                            target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> was financing foreign goods at 3-½ percent
                        while the Export-Import Bank was financing American goods at 5-¾ percent. On
                        the other hand, any decrease in rates on Export-Import Bank loans to bring
                        them closer to the rates on <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans would
                        make it more difficult for the Export-Import Bank to obtain private
                        participation in its loans. Treasury had looked forward to the Export-Import
                        Bank’s selling some of its paper this year to help balance the budget. Any
                        increase in the rate on <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> economic
                        overhead loans would raise the <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0373"
                        />question of the U.S. rate versus the Soviet rate, but there was a question
                        as to the significance of a 3-½ percent rate payable in local currency that
                        remained in the foreign country as against a Soviet rate of 2 percent that
                        was taken out of the borrowing country in real goods. Alternative B was
                        preferable but there was a very difficult rate problem and it was necessary
                        to go further towards solving it than we have in this ad hoc measure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said that he thought the
                        proposal that had been made in the paper and the discussion that had been
                        presented by the Staff and by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UTG1"
                            >Upton</persName> covered the matter very well.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said he would emphasize what
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UTG1">Upton</persName> had said as to this being
                        an ad hoc solution to the immediate problems with which we are faced. He
                        thought the State Department would prefer Alternative A to Alternative B
                        since the decision was ad hoc, but if Treasury preferred Alternative B State
                        would agree.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMS1">Szymczak</persName> said he agreed with
                        everything Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UTG1">Upton</persName> had said. It was
                        necessary to emphasize the temporary nature of the solution and the need for
                        continuing study of the problem of interest rates so that another look could
                        be taken at it in the fall. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kearns</persName>
                        also agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UTG1">Upton</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLK1">Macy</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4"
                            >Robert M. Macy, Chief of the International Division, Bureau of the
                            Budget.</note> observed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UTG1"
                            >Upton</persName> had indicated that if the rate fell below 5-¾ percent
                        it would interfere with selling loans from the Export-Import Bank’s
                        portfolio. He inquired whether there would be any difficulty if the rate
                        remained at 5-¾ percent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName>
                        thought the 5-¾ percent rate was satisfactory. He added that he was finding
                        more interest on the part of the private capital market and referred to the
                        participation of the commercial banks in the program of financial assistance
                        to Spain.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLK1">Macy</persName> said the Bureau of the Budget
                        wanted some assurance that this decision would not unduly affect the
                        understanding with the Export-Import Bank with respect to the budget. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said that the understanding
                        was that the Export-Import Bank should use every effort to avoid drawing on
                        the Treasury during the current fiscal year. Whether or not the Bank could
                        do that would depend on the regulations laid down by Treasury on the
                        differential on guaranties over and above what Treasury is paying. The Bank
                        was still trying to sell paper on a non-recourse basis. The difference
                        between 5-¾ and 6-½ percent was not going to affect the problem the Bureau
                        of the Budget was raising. The Chairman agreed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> observed that coordination
                        by the Council was particularly appropriate in the field of interest rates
                        and although the Bank was willing to accept either Alternative A or B
                        thought that from the standpoint of the Council Alternative B was
                        preferable.</p>
                    <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0374"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> moved the adoption of
                        Alternative B and the Chairman stated it was the sense of the meeting to
                        adopt B.</p>
                    <p>The interest rate on loans by the Development Loan Fund was then discussed.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said he did not like the
                        idea of referring to an Export-Import rate and a <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                            >DLF</gloss> rate. He would like to have a ruling by the <gloss
                            target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> that certain rates be charged by the two
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UTG1">Upton</persName> repeated that he was
                        concerned about the anomaly of using U.S. funds at low interest rates to
                        finance the purchase of goods abroad, and asked how important the 3-½
                        percent was, particularly since it was charged in local currency.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said the State Department
                        felt that the 3-½ percent rate was about the right level for economic
                        overhead projects. The <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> charged 5-¾
                        percent on the profit-earning types of projects, and the average interest
                        rate on <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans was about 4.4 percent last
                        year. The State Department thought some regard should be paid to the fact
                        that the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> was created as a substitute for
                        grants, that it is a prime instrument of U.S. foreign policy, and that even
                        less than the Export-Import Bank and the International Bank is it a
                        profit-making institution. The Soviets make a great deal of the fact that we
                        charge higher rates than they do. The State Department did not think the
                        traffic would bear more than 3-½ percent. You could not go much above that
                        figure without endangering our psychological objectives. There was also the
                        argument of status quo—any increase would be a shock to the borrowing
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGH1">Willis</persName> pointed out that when the
                        3-½ percent rate was set it was related to the then cost of money to the
                        U.S. Government of about 3-¼ percent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1"
                            >Mann</persName> said we were talking about loans most of which are
                        repayable in local currency, and questioned whether anything would be gained
                        by raising the interest rate by ½ or 1 percent.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UTG1">Upton</persName> thought a more important
                        factor was the relationship with other rates in this country as well as the
                        impact on exporters. He was still disturbed about purchases abroad.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> agreed it was unfair
                        competition. He recognized the validity of the argument and the seriousness
                        of the balance-of-payments situation, but wondered whether the problem was
                        not one of procurement, not merely related to <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                            >DLF</gloss> but of general application. The State Department had begun
                        an independent study on what to do about it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> felt strongly that the problem was one of procurement
                        and that it should be dealt with directly rather than through the interest
                        rate. The Chairman agreed that this was the effective way to deal with the
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said he was glad to hear the
                        statement that the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> was a substitute for
                        grants. He did not think you could compete with the Soviets on interest
                        rates. They could always change their rates, whatever our practice was.
                        However, if there was any argument for <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343"
                            facs="0375"/>increasing interest rates it was that the repayment would
                        be in local currency. He cited as examples of anomalies in rates that the
                        International Bank had made a $72 million highway loan to Iran at 6 percent,
                        the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> a $25 million loan to the same
                        Government at 3-½ percent, and the Export-Import Bank a highway loan to
                        Liberia at 4-¾ percent.</p>
                    <p>He said that the Filipinos had been in that day to discuss some loans. He had
                        told them that he thought the U.S. Government should take the position that
                        the Philippines could buy dredges anywhere they wanted but if they bought in
                        Germany the U.S. should not furnish the financing. His only serious
                        disagreement with the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> was that he
                        thought the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> was making loans in fields
                        where they should not. The same thing would be true of the Inter-American
                        Bank. He added that the U.S. economy is vital to the whole free world and he
                        thought we were financing ourselves out of the international market to the
                        extent that we might weaken our position.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman observed that the important factors with respect to the <gloss
                            target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans were the character of the loans and
                        the fact they were not tied. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1"
                            >Waugh</persName> said a third factor was the cost of money to the U.S.
                        He added that if the loans are tied and two institutions make loans in the
                        same field, one should go out of business.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMS1">Szymczak</persName> thought the only thing to
                        do was to bring the matter back to the Council for review as often as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman announced that it was the sense of the meeting that on a
                        temporary basis the rate of 3-½ percent would be continued on economic
                        overhead loans by the Development Loan Fund. The following action was taken: <list>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGH1">Willis</persName> stated that the Treasury
                        Department might be called upon to appear before the Senate Foreign
                        Relations Committee the following Tuesday (July 21) to make a brief
                        statement on the proposed International Development Association. The timing
                        presented a problem since it had been anticipated to bring to the Staff
                        Committee soon a draft <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> report which
                        could go to the Congress later this session and which would be considerably
                        more full than the brief report made to Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1"
                            >Fulbright</persName> in May 1959 (see <gloss target="#t_NAC1"

                        recalled that in January 1959 the Council had transmitted an interim report

                        April a “talking paper” had been prepared which had been used for

                    <p>Since that time there had been discussions with the Executive Directors of
                        the International Bank as well as with Mr. <persName>Erhard</persName>, Mr.
                            <persName>Pinay</persName>, the British, and other distinguished
                        visitors. Reactions were generally favorable. At this stage the questions
                        which might be raised by other countries were not entirely clear, but there
                        were some definite indications as to the matters of most concern to the
                        foreign technical people. There was a considerable amount of hesitation
                        about soft loans. The other countries have done little in the way of
                        providing assistance, as distinct from hard loans, within their own colonial
                        spheres, and this brings them into a multilateral assistance program for the
                        free world as a whole. There was a question as to the eligibility of
                        colonies and a problem with respect to countries like Australia which
                        consider themselves in an intermediate category, and which feel they would
                        contribute without qualifying for soft loans from <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss>. There were special problems relating to countries such as
                        the Netherlands and China. Despite these particular problems, it was hoped
                        to have a document soon which the International Bank would transmit to all
                        the Governors indicating that the United States would probably wish to
                        introduce a resolution regarding <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> at the
                        September meetings. The matter of a possible contingency item in the 1961
                        budget had also been discussed with the Bureau of the Budget.</p>
                    <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0377"/>
                    <p>The testimony to be given on Tuesday would be based on the documents already
                        distributed. It was hoped not to anticipate the discussions which should be
                        held within the Council forum during the next week or two.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> asked whether the Council
                        had ever been presented with the question whether the U.S. would actively
                        support <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>. When the idea of an
                        International Development Association was started it was solely in terms of
                        local currency but now it had changed completely. It was pointed out that
                        the talking paper had been circulated to Council agencies and had received
                        their approval, and that the letter of May 15, 1959, to Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> had been cleared by Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> with the other Council
                        members, although this may have occurred during a visit abroad by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLK1">Macy</persName> inquired whether figures
                        would be discussed in the Tuesday testimony. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGH1"
                            >Willis</persName> said the letter to Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> had stated that we assumed the
                        initial capital should be in the range of $1 billion and that U.S.
                        participation would be about $300 million. The $1 billion figure was the one
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_MASM1">Monroney</persName> had used. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> thought this referred to
                        local currency. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGH1">Willis</persName> said this
                        was not entirely clear. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MASM1"
                            >Monroney</persName> gave an important role to local currency but it was
                        not clear it was the only aspect he had considered. While not all of the
                        talking paper had been discussed with Senator <persName corresp="#p_MASM1"
                            >Monroney</persName>, a number of the problems had been reviewed with
                        him. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MASM1">Monroney</persName> had stressed
                        local currency, but also an element of capital which should be available for
                        loans at low interest rates for long terms repayable in local currency.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLK1">Macy</persName> inquired whether the Treasury
                        representatives would refer to any figures other than those included in the
                        May letter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGH1">Willis</persName> said there
                        would be no other dollar figures. There were indefinite amounts of local
                        currency involved.</p>

                    <p>On July 31, Secretary of the Treasury <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> wrote to the President of the International Bank
                        for Reconstruction and Development and asked him to place the topic of an
                        International Development Association on the agenda for the Bank’s annual
                        meeting. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> wrote that he
                        intended to introduce a resolution instructing the Bank’s executive
                        directors to study the question of establishing an association and to
                        formulate articles of agreement for submission to member governments. He
                        also attached a set of guidelines for the study. For texts of the letter and
                        guidelines, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current

                        were also published in a report on the proposed association prepared by the

                        The report, which <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> forwarded
                        to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on August 14, endorsed creating an
                        International Development Association. For text of its conclusions, see

                        on August 26 for consultations with European leaders at Bonn, London, and
                        Paris. On August 31, he and British Prime Minister <persName

                        discussions. In this report, which was televised live from <persName

                        Minister asked Eisenhower about the need for international development. The

                        expanding the use of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, where a
                        great many countries would be making decisions on this matter when they were
                        supplying little or none of the resources. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> went on to say that he is fearful of any joint
                        development effort with the Soviets because they use a managed currency and
                        would be putting in money of inferior quality while we were putting in hard
                        dollars. The President said he had simply thought of inviting the Russians
                        to contribute resources in support of projects that had been set up and
                        cleared by the World Bank. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said that the Russians are not being invited into
                        the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the suggestion he has been putting forth presupposes
                        a complete change in the international atmosphere, in which the Russians
                        would want to act cooperatively and constructively rather than in “cold war”
                        measures. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said another
                        problem is that they would be enabled to send Soviet agents out all around
                        the world. He said he is strongly desirous not to get into a mutual effort
                        with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The President said what he has been trying to do is to hold out before the
                        Russians the possibility of their functioning on the same basis as any other
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that the recent
                        discussion over these possibilities has resulted in some of the other
                        countries shying away from the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> proposal
                        and tending to favor <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>. The
                        President repeated that he is not thinking of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> in this connection. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> recalled that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
                            Gaulle</persName>, some time ago, had said he would favor inviting the
                        Soviets in to a joint operation.<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">See <ref

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> was asked at his
                        September 17 press conference about reports that he intended to suggest to
                        Soviet Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, who was
                        visiting the United States, that the two countries jointly assist the
                        underdeveloped nations. He replied that “until there is some kind of
                        peaceful solution of the political differences between ourselves and the
                        Soviets, it is manifest that we couldn’t ask them to be partners in any

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> said he would like to discuss in
                        particular two suggestions: (1) the possibility of occasional meetings under
                        the auspices of the United Nations Economic and Social Council at which
                        officials of ministerial level would discuss important questions of economic
                        policy; and (2) the nature of any relationship between the proposed
                        International Development Association and the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the first suggestion, Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName>
                        noted with regret a decline in the influence and prestige of <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>. As a consequence, the Second and
                        Third Committees of the General Assembly had tended to become much more
                        prominent. This tendency was most regrettable since a body like <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> was much better constituted and
                        equipped to enable serious and responsible discussion of economic and social
                        problems. He thought that a high level discussion of an important economic
                        issue under <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> auspices would not
                        only be useful in itself but would also add to the prestige of <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>What Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> had in mind was an Ad Hoc meeting
                        lasting not more than four or five days. Such a meeting would be devoted to
                        a specific subject, and would be provided with good documentation,
                        distributed sufficiently in advance to enable serious study. Mr.
                            <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> hoped that under these circumstances
                        there would be a real exchange of views instead of mere statements of
                        position. He did not mean to reflect in any way upon regular sessions of
                            <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, which he thought were most
                        effective, but it was true that delegations <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350"
                            facs="0382"/>to <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> had to make
                        statements in line with precise instructions worked out beforehand. There
                        was little opportunity for representatives to express their reactions to
                        policy statements by other representatives. Mr.
                            <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> thought that economic policy officials
                        at the ministerial level might engage in a real exchange, particularly if
                        discussions were informal. In his view, there would be no resolutions
                        emerging from such sessions but simply an agreed report.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> appreciated the
                        Secretary-General’s clarification. He noted that the United States
                        Government had a general aversion to more regularly scheduled meetings,
                        since there already were so many. He noted further the general reluctance of
                        finance ministers to indulge in international discussions of policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> said he did not necessarily have in
                        mind ministers of finance; rather he was thinking of officials who made
                        general economic policy. In some countries this might be an official in Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s position, in others a
                        minister of economics, in others a minister of trade and in some a minister
                        of finance. It all depended on who was in charge of economic policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> observed that the
                        difficulties in arranging for United States participation in such a meeting
                        would be lessened if participation were not reserved for ministers of
                        finance.</p>
                    <p>As to the possible nature of such meetings, Mr.
                            <persName>Hammarskjold</persName>, for illustrative purposes, noted that
                        one topic might be the question of policy toward producers of primary
                        materials. He noted the increasing pressure from the primary producers for
                        some action to improve their situation. The Soviets have seized upon this
                        interest as a means of advancing their proposal for a World Economic
                        Conference. Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> was shocked even by the
                        name of such a meeting and was convinced that it would do far more harm than
                        good. As an alternative, he thought that one should consider re-invigorating
                            <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> by a high level discussion of
                        pressing economic problems.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>de Seynes</persName> said that another possible suggestion for
                        a high level meeting under <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>
                        auspices would be a review of current policy affecting economic development.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought this was an
                        interesting idea, but wondered whether it had not been put forward in
                        Resolution 1316 (XIII),<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d157fn4">footnote 4, Document 157</ref>.</note> a proposal
                        initiated by the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. de Seynes agreed that the elements in Resolution 1316 (XIII), would form
                        an excellent basis for a high level meeting. He said, however, that only the
                        United States had replied fully and well to the requests put forward in that
                        resolution for a report on current policies affecting economic
                        development.</p>
                    <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0383"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ1">Leddy</persName> asked whether the high level
                        meeting would be open or closed. Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> said
                        it could be arranged either way, depending on the view of potential
                        participants.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        on the reaction of other governments to Mr.
                            <persName>Hammarskjold</persName>’s tentative proposals, the
                        Secretary-General said the four Latin American countries he had visited in
                        August had been most interested. The United Kingdom was keen about the idea;
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> took it up with
                        Hammarskjold on his own initiative. <persName corresp="#p_LS1"
                            >Lloyd</persName> commented jokingly that he did not “know if it was you
                        or Ormsby-Gore who started this.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he had been impressed
                        by the suggestion of Australian Foreign Minister Casey in his statement to
                        the General Assembly. Mr. <persName>Casey</persName> had suggested that
                            <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> might propose topics to be
                        considered by the General Assembly each year.<note n="3" xml:id="d183fn3"
                            >For text of Casey’s September 30 address, see U.N. doc.
                            A/PV.814.</note></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Phillips</persName> inquired what if any role
                        the Secretary-General had in mind for General Assembly action to promote his
                        ministerial level meeting idea. The Secretary-General said he would welcome
                        current GA action recommending that <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> consider such a proposal, but of course <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> would have full responsibility to
                        work out arrangements.</p>
                    <p>The discussion next turned to the question of a relationship between the
                        United Nations and the proposed International Development Association. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that anything decided
                        would have to be in agreement with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1"
                            >Black</persName>. Likewise, anything which suited Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> would also suit the United States.
                        This was, of course, subject to the reservation that there would be no
                        influence or intervention in the actual operations of the International Bank
                        or the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> emphatically affirmed that he did not
                        have in mind any sort of United Nations role in the actual operation of the
                        Bank or the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>. He thought, however, that
                        there were two good reasons for setting up a Consultative Board for the
                            <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> which might be similar to the
                        Consultative Board of the Special Fund. The discussions of the Consultative
                        Board had helped greatly in clarifying the relationship of the various other
                        programs to the Special Fund. On the other hand, views expressed by members
                        of the Consultative Board were purely advisory and the Managing Director
                        could accept or reject them as he saw fit. Mr.
                            <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> thought that, in the case of any
                        similar board that might be set up for the <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss>, the complete independence of <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss> and International Bank operations must be safeguarded.</p>
                    <p>The second reason why Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> favored a
                        Consultative Board for <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> was tactical.
                        Frankly, he considered the tactical problem more urgent. There was the
                        feeling among many underdeveloped countries that they should have more
                        opportunity to express <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0384"/>their views.
                        Among the developed countries, many like the Scandinavians, Canada and the
                        Netherlands were eager to have some sort of symbolic tie between the <gloss
                            target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> and the United Nations in order to resist
                        more firmly the pressure for a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Capital
                        Fund as well as <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>. Supporters of <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> would find it difficult to switch
                        their support exclusively to <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> in the
                        absence of some gesture toward the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                        Sometimes when two groups are two miles apart the gesture of walking a
                        hundred yards helps enormously to solve the problem. Mr.
                            <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> felt that this was just such an
                        occasion and a gesture would give <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members
                        a feeling that their views are in the picture, if such a gesture were made
                        in the immediate future. He expected a visit from Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> shortly and would discuss these
                        points at that time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Phillips</persName> noted that in all
                        likelihood we would be confronted with a General Assembly resolution urging
                        that consideration be given, in drafting the articles of agreement of the
                            <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>, to a link with the United Nations.
                        He thought that, provided the Secretary-General and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> had agreed on some relationship, we
                        might go along with a resolution calling for an “appropriate link”.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Huertematte</persName>, who had been to almost every meeting of
                        the Board of Governors of the International Bank, in his capacity as
                        Governor representing Panama, supported Mr.
                            <persName>Hammarskjold</persName>’s suggestion. Mr.
                            <persName>Huertematte</persName> felt that the desire of the
                        under-developed countries for a voice in the policy of <gloss
                            target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> might give rise to some concession in
                        voting procedure. He thought it would be very bad, since it would give the
                        under-developed countries an entering wedge into the management of the
                            <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> as well as <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss>. On the other hand, however, a Consultative Board including
                        the Secretary-General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be an
                        effective gesture toward the under-developed countries and would not carry
                        the risk of interference in the operation of either the <gloss
                            target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                            >IBRD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> pointed out that he would be seeing Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> from time to time on an
                        informal basis and periodically at sessions of the Consultative Board of the
                        Special Fund. At such times the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, the
                            <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> and the Special Fund would
                        inevitably be talked about; consequently, the main significance of having
                        some sort of Consultative Board for the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>
                        would be symbolic.<note n="4" xml:id="d183fn4"><persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> discussed this conversation with <persName

                    <p>On October 20, Vance Brand, Managing Director of the Development Loan Fund,
                        announced that in light of the economic recovery of other industrialized
                        nations and the U.S. balance-of-payments deficit, the Fund would begin to
                        give priority to projects that financed U.S. goods and services. For text of
                        his statement, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current
                            Documents, 1959</hi>, page 1686.</p>
                    <p>Asked at his October 22 press conference in Augusta, Georgia, whether this
                        represented a departure from past policy of purchasing commodities and
                        equipment from free world sources, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> stated: “This is not a turnaround, a reversal, or
                        going in another direction. It is simply to point out that when we are
                        making this money available, it’s dollars that’s being made available; and
                        where it is feasible and reasonable, we want that money to be spent here.”
                            (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</p>
                    <p>Interest in this policy continued. In response to an inquiry at his October
                        28 press conference, Eisenhower commented further: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“What we say is that we are examining all of these procedures that we
                                use in extending credit to the world to see whether or not we
                                shouldn’t have some arrangements whereby our own trade, our own

                            <p>On November 16, <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName>
                                explained to the National Foreign Trade Council in New York that the
                                United States had no plans to apply the <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                                    >DLF</gloss> policy to the International Cooperation
                                Administration because <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                                procurement operated under different circumstances and because such
                                restrictions could hamper private enterprise in the recipient
                                countries. Appropriate <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> projects,
                                however, might be transferred to the Fund and would then fall under
                                the new criteria. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., pages 30–36) Under

                                reiterated these points at the November 19 Council on Foreign

                                to prevent more severe congressional action, but because it was “a

                    <p>I am attaching a memorandum regarding “Points on European Lending to Less

                        Government.”</p>
                    <p>Though we have apparently made some progress already in shifting European

                        the heads-of-government level—the urgency of their taking the lead with
                        early, concrete actions in this field.</p>
                    <p>The main points I feel you should stress, in any conversation with Europeans,

                        <p>Our general view that the financially strong countries of Western Europe
                            should now provide a substantially increased flow of financing for less

                                September 30 address, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
                                    Current Documents, 1959</hi>, pages 223–225.</note> It is also
                            well-known to the Europeans from numerous private statements, including
                            your own comments during your previous trip to Europe.</p>
                        <p>In a general way, our view on this matter is already widely accepted by
                            European government officials as well as private observers. As one
                            example of this, the Marshall Plan countries (in a recent meeting of the
                            Economic Policy Committee of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>)
                            concluded unanimously that Europe should provide increased capital to
                            less developed areas as one means of avoiding an unnecessary and harmful
                            further increase in its own foreign-exchange reserves.</p>
                        <p>However, the European countries have not yet translated these general
                            principles into any significant concrete action; and we may not see
                            prompt and substantial results unless we press them further, both at a
                            high level and in a somewhat more specific way.</p>
                        <p>Each of the European countries, individually, would really like to
                            accumulate somewhat more reserves and is afraid its present strong
                            position may for some reason be temporary. Each of them has a strong
                            feeling that one or more of its neighbors is in a better position than
                            itself to shoulder this burden, and all of them show a tendency to
                            over-emphasize somewhat the question of rather detailed “coordination”
                            of whatever they might do in this field with similiar U.S. and <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>
                            activities. Finally, and perhaps most important, none of these countries
                            presently has any fully satisfactory banking or budgetary arrangements
                            for providing long-term lending which is adapted to the needs of the
                            less developed areas.</p>
                        <p>Our recent action with respect to financing provided by our Development
                            Loan Fund is already causing some European exporters to bring the matter
                            of the need for more European financing to the attention of their
                            governments. Over time this incentive, which did not exist as long as
                            our <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> was providing financing for
                            European exporters, should provide an important additional motivation
                            for action by European governments.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, in order to get early and significant results from the
                            Europeans in this field, it seems necessary to impress upon the
                            strongest and largest of the European countries, at the
                            heads-of-government level, the urgency of their cutting through the
                            apparent difficulties and <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0388"
                            />getting forward with early and concrete bilateral action (in addition
                            to supporting the World Bank’s activities and the proposed International
                            Development Association) to provide an increased flow of European funds
                            into the less developed areas. In this connection, substantial actions
                            by both Germany and Italy plus at least some action by the United
                            Kingdom are probably prerequisite to any significant action by other
                            European countries.</p>

                                    Development Association) and also through a substantial increase

                                <item><p>Such bilateral European lending ought to be selectively
                                        related to projects which are economically useful to the
                                        borrowing countries and extended on a long-term basis
                                        appropriate to the kinds of equipment involved, whereas
                                        present bilateral European financing is almost exclusively
                                        limited to short-term export-credit guarantees.</p>
                                    <p>These European export-credit systems were designed basically
                                        to move exports without regard to the economic needs of the
                                        borrowing countries. Moreover, their short maturities
                                        (limited to a maximum of 5–7 years even for heavy equipment
                                        which the Europeans would finance for their own domestic use
                                        on maturities of 20–25 years) have frequently contributed to
                                        financial crises in the borrowing countries and frequently
                                        had to be refinanced with longer-term funds from
                                        non-European sources.</p></item>

                                <item><p>Our own experience in this field has convinced us that
                                        industrial countries cannot successfully carry out their
                                        responsibilities in financing less developed areas solely
                                        through private investment or purely-private lending
                                        institutions. In the light of this we believe one urgent and
                                        essential first step for virtually all of the European
                                        countries, to enable them to provide long-term bilateral
                                        financing for less developed areas, is the establishment of
                                        appropriate public or semi-public tanking institutions for
                                        this purpose.</p>
                                    <p>Though many of these countries may be reluctant to
                                        appropriate budgetary funds for foreign-lending
                                        institutions, most of them could establish some sort of bank
                                        for bilateral long-term foreign lending (similar to the
                                        loans by our own Export-Import Bank) which would finance
                                        itself through sale of governmentally-guaranteed securities

                        <p>The following special points on this subject might be stressed in
                            individual conversations <hi rend="italic">with Chancellor <persName

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Germany</hi>. Germany is generally acknowledged to be
                            financially able to make the largest European contribution to this
                            problem, and is probably also the most important exporter of heavy
                            equipment to many less developed areas.</p>
                        <p>The Germans do have a public bank (Reconstruction Loan Corporation) which
                            has recently been given limited authority and funds to make long-term
                            loans to less developed countries. What seems to be most needed now is a
                            substantial increase in the funds available to this bank for foreign
                            lending, a clear policy recognition that such lending is to become a
                            major and continuing function of this bank, and a positive effort by
                            this bank to seek out suitable lending projects in less developed
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>The Germans currently argue that they have been losing rather than
                            gaining foreign-exchange reserves during 1959 as a result of large
                            “capital outpayments”—and that this demonstrates they are already doing
                            as much as they properly should or can in total foreign lending.
                            However, their total gold and liquid U.S. dollar holdings still exceeded
                            $4 billion at end of June (down only some $200 million from the end of
                            last year); and, against this, they have virtually no short-term
                            liabilities to other countries. Moreover, our understanding of the
                            current situation is that: <list>

                                    long-term debt to the United States) which are unlikely to
                                    recur.</item>

                        <p>The Germans have also been stressing their strong desire for a rather
                            high degree of “coordination” of any long-term lending they might
                            provide bilaterally to less developed areas with similar loans or other
                            aid extended by the World Bank and the United States. We have <pb
                                n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0390"/>already indicated our
                            receptiveness to some informal exchange of information, centered in the
                            World Bank, on the economic needs and priorities of borrowing countries
                            as well as their existing financial commitments; and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> and his staff are currently
                            exploring the details of what might usefully be done along this line.
                            While we seek to satisfy legitimate German concerns on this point, we
                            are anxious not to let any overly-perfectionist ideas about
                            “coordination” get in the way of early progress by Germany on practical
                            measures to provide increased bilateral lending.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>. The problem with the Italians is mainly
                            psychological; they still consider themselves poor, as well as small;
                            and they point to the development problems of Southern Italy in support
                            of this view. However, their official gold and dollar reserves are now
                            the third largest in Europe (rapidly approaching those of the United
                            Kingdom) and show every sign of continuing to grow.</p>
                        <p>Though Southern Italy’s needs may make it somewhat more difficult,
                            politically, for the Italians to finance foreign lending, it also seems
                            clear that Italian heavy industry has a heavy stake in the sale of
                            equipment to less developed areas outside of Italy. In any case, world
                            trade and payments cannot be kept in satisfactory balance if Italy
                            continues to absorb gold and liquid dollar holdings from less developed
                            countries and others at anything like recent rates ($1.2 billion during
                            the year and half ending June 1959). Moreover, the Italian banking
                            system appears highly liquid and the capital market increasingly strong;
                            and establishment of some special bank to provide financing to less
                            developed areas on a long-term basis should be relatively easy, as a
                            technical matter.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">United Kingdom</hi>. The British feel they are
                            presently doing about all they can in the foreign financing field—on the
                            grounds that their gold and dollar reserves are still low in relation to
                            their trade needs and financial responsibilities, that their prospective
                            balance of payments surplus is very small, and that they already have
                            heavy development responsibilities within the Commonwealth. On the
                            whole, we can agree that the United Kingdom has been doing a good deal
                            in this field over a considerable period of time and in the face of
                            financial difficulties of its own.</p>
                        <p>However, in view of our interest in obtaining increased bilateral
                            development lending from many of the European countries, rather than
                            only one or two, it would be of great help if the British could exercise
                            some leadership by taking some definite additional steps in this
                            direction. This would involve moves to provide more financing for
                            development projects outside, as well as inside, the Commonwealth; and
                            to finance more heavy-equipment purchases by less developed countries on
                            appropriate long maturities rather than through present short-term
                            export credits. (The British already have a procedure— <pb n="359"
                                xml:id="pg_359" facs="0391"/>under Section 3 of their Export
                            Guarantees legislation—for providing long-term loans to overseas
                            countries on a project basis; but the funds so far made available under
                            this procedure are quite modest and have been mainly used for
                            Commonwealth countries.)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">France</hi>. It is probably not desirable to press the
                            French, right now, for any action in this field—other than their firm
                            support of the proposed International Development Association under
                            World Bank management. French financial capability to provide additional
                            foreign lending is presently limited by the fact the recovery in their
                            foreign-exchange reserves has come later than, and is still somewhat
                            short of, that in other European countries—plus the heavy developmental
                            responsibilities they already have inside the franc area, particularly
                            in Africa. Moreover, it is currently of great importance to restrain
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> from pressing
                            his previous notions about some new multilateral scheme for financing
                            economic development with Soviet participation.</p>
                        <p>(Later on, if the French export and reserve positions continue to improve
                            as they have been doing and if concrete further actions to increase
                            bilateral lending to less developed areas are obtained from the Germans,
                            Italians and British, then we may be in a somewhat better position to
                            urge similar action on the French.)</p>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> would be a new international
                        institution, affiliated with and staffed by the World Bank, to provide
                        financing for economic development of less developed areas on terms easier
                        than World Bank terms, for example, by offering “soft” loans, i.e., loans
                        repayable in local currency, or loans repayable in hard currency but at low
                        interest rates and with long repayment periods. Membership would be open to
                        all members of the World Bank, and financing would be available to the less
                        developed countries joining <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> and to
                        dependent territories <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0392"/>of the
                        industrialized countries. Initial capital would be $1 billion of which the
                        United States would subscribe about $320 million and the other
                        industrialized countries about $440 million, all in convertible currencies
                        freely usable in member countries. Less developed countries would subscribe
                        the remainder, most of which would be in their own currencies. Subject to
                        special agreements, <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> could receive and
                        make use of foreign currencies acquired by the United States Government
                        under agricultural surplus sales programs. Consideration would be given
                        every five years to the desirability of increasing <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss>’s resources by additional multilateral subscriptions.</p>
                    <p>The consideration of <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> grew out of a
                        suggestion by Senator <persName corresp="#p_MASM1">Monroney</persName> which
                        resulted in a Senate Resolution in July 1958. In August of that year, the
                        President, in reply to a letter from Treasury Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>, requested the Secretary to
                        initiate negotiations looking toward the establishment of an <gloss
                            target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> as an affiliate of the World Bank if, as
                        the result of informal discussions with other governments, the creation of
                        such an Association appeared feasible.<note n="1" xml:id="d186fn1">See <ref

                        their Annual Meeting in September 1959, the President gave his support to
                        the creation of an <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>. (The text of the
                        President’s address is attached.) During the course of the meeting the World
                        Bank Governors unanimously approved a United States Resolution that a
                        charter of an <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> be drafted.<note n="2"

                        This charter is now being negotiated by the Executive Board of the World
                        Bank, the U. S. member of which is Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
                            <persName corresp="#p_UTG1">T. Graydon Upton</persName>. It is
                        anticipated that the charter will be ready for formal submission to
                        governments early in 1960 and that presentation to Congress will follow
                        shortly thereafter.</p>
                    <p>Primary United States interest in <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> is
                        based on recognition of the need for capital in many areas of the free world
                        for financing sound development projects which cannot now be financed on
                        terms offered by the World Bank and other sources, and on the recognition
                        that other industrialized countries can and should make substantial
                        additional capital available to these less developed areas. It is important,
                        however, that any provision of easier financing be supplementary to the
                        World Bank and not compete with it or impair its strength or prestige. The
                        first draft of an <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> charter now under
                        consideration demonstrates clearly the broad agreement among industrialized
                        as well as less developed countries that an <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss> can become an important <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361"
                            facs="0393"/>new source of capital for promoting economic development
                        within a framework which would safeguard existing institutions and
                        traditional forms of private finance.</p>
                    <p>If appropriate during his discussions, it might be desirable if the President
                        expressed confidence that the country concerned will wish to give its
                        support to <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> and to join in this
                        cooperative effort.</p>
                    <p>One of the most difficult questions which has arisen during the negotiations
                        of the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> charter is whether <gloss
                            target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> should have the authority to make grants as
                        well as loans. As the result of pressure for a provision on grants, the
                        charter as now drafted contains some flexibility on this question in
                        connection with future capital. The U.S. Delegation is taking a firm
                        position, however, that <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> should have no
                        authority to make grants from its initial capital, and it is believed that a
                        satisfactory charter will be worked out on this basis. The reason for the
                        especially firm U.S. position is the belief of the importance of this point
                        in presenting the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> charter to
                        Congress.</p>

                                differ from those applying to the D.L.F. Therefore, for the present

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Basis</hi>: The basis for the new financing policy is this.
                        The economic and financial strength of other industrialized countries is
                        such that continuation of <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> financing of
                        their exports to less developed countries is no longer warranted. By using
                        Development Loan Fund money largely to finance procurement from United
                        States sources and by leaving other industrial countries to extend their own
                        financing on reasonable terms in connection with their exports to less
                        developed countries, we hope that the total amount of goods available for
                        less developed countries may be increased.</p>
                    <p>Placing primary emphasis on D.L.F. financing of goods and services of U.S.
                        origin cannot be regarded as a departure from a multilateral trade policy,
                        and it is erroneous for the D.L.F. decision to be construed as a new “Buy
                        American” policy. If a loan applicant desires long-term financing to procure
                        equipment abroad it is the D.L.F. view that he should, when funds are not
                        available from other international lending sources, look principally to the
                        producing country to supply such funds on reasonable terms and conditions
                        rather than to the D.L.F. Because of the presumption that offshore
                        procurement can be financed abroad, the D.L.F. will now give primary
                        attention to providing, in accordance with its criteria, development loan
                        financing for those applicants who wish to buy goods and equipment of U. S.
                        origin. Whether they buy in America, however, is a question of choice, a
                        situation made possible by the improved financial position of other
                        industrialized countries.</p>
                    <p>For various reasons, whether through export credit facilities or other
                        formally tied financing arrangements, through traditional marketing
                        arrangements, through discrimination against other country’s exports, or
                        through other factors, the bulk of the development financing provided by
                        other industrialized countries is used to buy their own products or those of
                        the monetary areas of which they are the center. Moreover, what direct
                        government financing they do extend is usually <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363"
                            facs="0395"/>repayable in the lender’s currency and for a medium term of
                        years, whereas D.L.F. generally accepts repayment in the currency of the
                        borrower and frequently permits long repayment periods.</p>
                    <p>Under our new policy, less developed countries which find it advantageous to
                        buy equipment from industrialized countries other than the United States
                        will seek financing in those countries for such procurement. They will tend
                        to concentrate on seeking D.L.F. financing for those development projects
                        for which they may procure most efficiently in the United States. In
                        determining the country from which they procure, they are apt to consider
                        many factors, including price, quality, financing terms, delivery period and
                        service facilities.</p>
                    <p>The new policy should also help to reduce this country’s losses of gold and
                        dollars to other industrialized countries. These losses have become
                        extremely large in the last ten years. It is hard to overemphasize the need
                        for maintaining a sound dollar, both internally and externally, particularly
                        at a time when the United States is playing such an important role in the
                        leadership of the Free World and in support of the economic growth of the
                        less developed countries.</p>
                    <p>In 1958 the outflow of gold and liquid dollars to foreigners was $3.4
                        billion. An even larger outflow nearer to $4 billion is likely this year.
                        The outflow this year would be even greater in the absence of some large
                        debt prepayments by other industrialized countries which ordinarily would
                        have repaid their debts over a period of years in accordance with the
                        servicing schedule. For example, in March, Germany prepaid $150 million on
                        postwar indebtedness, and in October the United Kingdom made a $250 million
                        prepayment on a loan by the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                    <p>The current deficit reflects the continuation at high levels of U.S. public
                        and private capital outflow and military expenditures abroad at the same
                        time that our export surplus of goods and services has declined. Because of
                        the notable uncertainty of balance of payments forecasts due to the many
                        unpredictable elements involved, it is not possible to arrive at any
                        definite judgment as to when the current unfavorable trend in our payments
                        will be terminated.</p>
                    <p>It must be recognized that if deficits were to continue, they could create
                        important difficulties for this country. Although the gold holdings of the
                        United States amount to approximately $19.5 billion, they are some $3
                        billion less than two years ago. During the same period United States liquid
                        liabilities to foreign countries rose approximately $3 billion and now, on
                        the basis of data not yet published, amount to about $18 billion (excluding
                        holdings of international institutions but including U.S. Government bonds
                        and notes).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Results to Date</hi>: There have been several indications
                        to date that the new D.L.F. policy is putting pressure on European countries
                        to do their own financing of their exports to less developed countries and
                        on <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0396"/>terms more appropriate for
                        development projects. For example, Pakistan recently announced a $6 million
                        credit from Germany for financing railway equipment which prior to the new
                        D.L.F. policy Pakistan would have purchased in Germany with D.L.F. dollars.
                        Similarly, there is now talk that European governments are actively
                        considering the possibility of providing governmental guarantees on private
                        export credits for maturities of up to 15 years, on capital equipment
                        exports, compared with the present maximum of 5-7 years.<note n="3"

                        aid commenced toward close of Chancellor’s luncheon December 8. Amory opened
                        with following points. Both countries agree on importance economic
                        development. During meetings with Commonwealth <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                            >HMG</gloss> had stressed importance of (1) maintaining strength of own
                        economy as essential element in economic health of Commonwealth, (2)
                        importance underdevelopeds maintain favorable climate private investment,
                        and (3) where a choice exists trade preferable to aid.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> now committed “to the hilt.” Current
                        surplus in past year fully devoted to aid and overseas investment and
                        projected surplus in coming year more than committed these purposes. Amory
                        volunteered, however, that much private investment going to countries other
                        than underdevelopeds. While further strain on <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> balance-of-payments not justified, he said <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should be able afford additional aid in form
                        of unrequited exports. In this connection Indians had asked <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> whether they prepared sacrifice their own
                        standard of living in order to increase economic development. British had
                        replied their ability this direction limited by public opinion.</p>

                    <p>Finally, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> welcomes <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss> though still not happy about soft currency loans, but

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> position largely in agreement with ours. We
                        agree to trade versus aid and importance private investment, but these have
                        limits and private investors not enthusiastic about underdeveloped

                        greater German help and perhaps also help from Italy. Italian budgetary
                        position difficult but balance of payments would permit greater aid. British
                        asked whether use of <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> mechanism would

                        issued a special communiqué on the world economic situation. It asserted
                        that Western Europe’s economic progress enabled nearly all of the
                        industrialized nations of the free world to increase their efforts to
                        further international economic development and to pursue trade policies
                        promoting sound use of economic resources and international harmony, and

                    <p>The Chairman commented that there was wide agreement on the desirability of
                        encouraging the expansion of private home ownership abroad, and that it was
                        important to consider carefully the various means of doing so. He noted that
                        the first question before the Council was whether legislation which would
                        permit U.S. Federal savings and loan associations to invest in foreign
                        savings and loan associations would be desirable from the foreign financial
                        policy point of view. He asked the representative of the Federal Home Loan
                        Bank Board for comments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hallahan</persName> said that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
                        would not support legislation of the type appended to the paper, but would
                        support the chartering of a single private central organization that would
                        undertake the investments in foreign savings and loan associations as a form
                        of “seed capital”, in modest amounts, possibly amounting to $3 million-$5
                        million within a few years. The Council discussed the proposed legislation
                        particularly with respect to the character and extent of the risks involved
                        in such investments abroad, the current U.S. credit situation, the current
                        balance-of-payments problems of the United States, and the problems that
                        would be involved in attempts to apply standards of price stability with
                        respect to such investments. The <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0402"
                        />Council did not reach agreement on whether support by the Executive Branch
                        of such a legislative proposal would be advisable, and took no action in
                        this regard.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed and agreed that there would be no objection to the use
                        of U.S. local currency holdings on a modest basis for promoting home
                        ownership in less-developed countries through loans or investments to help
                        establish foreign savings and loan associations. It was noted that such use
                        of local currencies should take into account the alternative uses for the
                        currencies and the economic development priorities in the countries
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>The Council also discussed the possibility of U.S. Government dollar loans
                        and guarantees of repayment of private investments to help establish savings
                        and loan associations in the less-developed countries. It was agreed that
                        such loans and guarantees would not be generally desirable. It was suggested
                        that in exceptional cases in which it appeared to be in the national
                        interest, such loans and guarantees might be considered, and that the
                        conditions relevant to the consideration of such exceptional cases should
                        include the following: <list>
                            <label>1)</label>
                            <item>that U.S.-owned local currencies were not available for the

                            <item>that the country concerned was not undergoing severe

                            <item>that the loan or guaranteed investment would be only a small
                                proportion of the total investment in the project; and</item>

                            <item>that the loan or guarantee would be undertaken only in order to
                                begin the project and not as a continuing investment.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The Council also discussed the possibility of investment guarantees covering
                        expropriation, non-convertibility and war damage, for private U.S.
                        investments in foreign savings and loan associations, and for other forms of
                        investment in housing abroad. It was agreed that any proposals for such U.S.
                        Government guarantees of housing investments abroad would need to be
                        considered carefully, and that the method of handling such proposals would
                        be discussed further by the interested agencies.</p>

                    <p>The Council then discussed the developments in the preparation in the
                        International Bank of a draft charter for the International Development
                        Association. The Chairman asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGH1"
                            >Willis</persName> to review the situation for the information of the
                        Council.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGH1">Willis</persName> noted that the President of
                        the International Bank had called the Executive Directors of the Bank to
                        meet on January 25, 1960, to vote formally on transmitting the draft charter
                        to the member governments of the Bank for action, and that the U.S.
                        Executive Director of the Bank would need authority to record the vote of
                        the United States in favor of this referral. The draft Articles of Agreement
                        would be sent by the Executive Directors directly to governments. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGH1">Willis</persName> reviewed the structure of
                        the proposed International Development Association, the procedure and
                        schedule for the coming into force of the Articles of Agreement, and the
                        principal matters which had arisen in the negotiation of the charter. The
                        Council was informed that a draft Special Report of the Council on the
                        International Development Association would shortly be presented to the
                        Staff Committee for consideration.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion the Council took the following action

                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> described briefly the plans for
                        this new organization which would be a part of the World Bank. He noted the
                        size of the U.S. subscription to be paid over the next five years, and he
                        said that a bill would be submitted that would authorize the Executive to
                        accede to the Agreement.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> mentioned certain
                        particular advantages of the arrangement: (1) that it had been proposed at
                        New Delhi as a means of covering “marginal” loans which the World Bank could
                        not make; (2) that it had a potential for putting to use some of our P.L.
                        480 soft currencies, (3) that it provides a means for this sort of activity
                        outside of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, thus avoiding the creation
                        of an opportunity for Russia to exploit, and (4) that the United States was
                        able to withstand the effort that was made to provide for grants as well as
                        loans.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about the new countries that would be gaining
                        independence in Africa. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        said they could apply for membership. Sen. Kuchel inquired if Russia could
                        apply for membership. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        replied affirmatively but believed that the application would not be
                        approved, unless we should so desire, since the United States possesses a
                        large share of the voting power in the World Bank.</p>
                    <p>The President commented on the importance of activity such as this to help
                        insure that the economies of the underdeveloped nations progress along with
                        the rest of the free world.</p>

                        sent the Congress a National Advisory Council on International Monetary and

                        Doc. 345, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session) The President recommended
                        in his transmittal letter that Congress enact legislation authorizing U.S.
                        participation in the Association and providing funds for the U.S.
                        subscription to it. He emphasized again the need for free world
                        industrialized nations to promote economic progress in underdeveloped
                        countries. For text of the letter, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Arey</persName> referred to draft application and contract
                        forms for the proposed short-term political risk guarantees, and described
                        the manner in which the Bank envisaged their operation. He noted that the
                        Bank intended to discuss these draft forms and a draft contract for a
                        medium-term political risk guarantee with commercial banks in various parts
                        of the country at meetings arranged by some of the Federal Reserve Banks,
                        and that the draft forms were still subject to change in the light of
                        further consideration of their details. The Bank had already had numerous
                        discussions with exporter groups, and planned to have further meetings with
                        exporter groups after the plan became effective. The Bank would charge the
                        total amount of the guarantee contracts against its lending authority, but
                        since there was about $2 billion of unused lending authority available, the
                        Bank did not expect the guarantee program to interfere with project
                        lending.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Arey</persName> called the attention of the Council to the
                        proposal to participate under certain conditions with commercial banks in
                        medium-term export credits considered by the Export-Import Bank to be
                        otherwise eligible, in sole reliance on the credit judgment of the
                        commercial banks.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion the Chairman commended the Bank for its
                        promptness in developing these proposals, and noted that the facilities to
                        be offered U.S. exporters appeared to compare very favorably to guarantee
                        and financing facilities available to European <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376"
                            facs="0408"/>exporters. The Council agreed that approval of the
                        proposals presented to it would not limit the views of member or other
                        agencies with respect to further developments in this field.</p>
                    <p>The Council then took the following action (<gloss target="#t_NAC1"

                                short-term guarantees to exporters against 90 percent of the
                                political risks (non-transferability of foreign currencies; losses

                                commercial banks in financing medium-term credits for exports which

                                recourse to the exporter, and when the importer pays at least 20

                        countries.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman reviewed the earlier Council discussion of the general
                        legislative proposal, and recalled that the Council had reached no decision
                        on the matter at that time (see Council Minutes 60–1).<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d197fn3"><ref target="#d191">Document 191</ref>.</note> Since
                        Senate Bill 3282 was scheduled for prompt consideration by the Senate
                        Committee on Banking and Currency, and the Home Loan Bank Board proposal had
                        been advanced as a possible Executive Branch alternative, it was necessary
                        to reach an opinion as to the appropriate Executive Branch position on these
                        proposals.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed the risks and problems involved in dollar investments
                        in foreign savings and loan associations to meet essentially local currency
                        costs, in the light of the inflationary and balance-of-payments conditions
                        prevailing in many less-developed countries. In view of the particular
                        difficulties of undertaking such investments by individual savings and loan
                        associations and the absence of restriction of such investments to the
                        less-developed countries, the Council agreed that in its opinion the
                        Executive Branch should not support Senate Bill 3282.</p>
                    <p>It was noted that the corporation proposed by the Federal Home Loan Bank
                        Board would centralize the investments in foreign savings and loan
                        associations and would have advantages with respect to the availability of
                        information and the appraisal of proposed investments in foreign
                        associations. The major risk in such investments, however, was the transfer
                        risk, and under conditions existing in most of the less-developed countries
                        losses from this source appeared likely. Since such a corporation would be
                        created under U.S. Government sanction and authority, the Government would
                        be reluctant to permit the corporation to become financially unsound, in
                        view of the possible repercussions on Treasury financing operations. Thus in
                        effect the corporation would have a general Government guarantee against
                        losses. In addition, specific legislation affecting Development Loan Fund
                        guarantee of investments in housing ventures abroad was in prospect in the
                        pending Mutual Security legislation, so that investments in foreign savings
                        and loan associations would probably be accompanied by applications for such
                        guarantees. The Council also noted the difficulties that would result for
                        the less-developed countries from undertaking dollar servicing burdens on
                        account of investments that would not earn or save foreign exchange, such as
                        investments in housing. The importance of a history of reasonable price
                        stability for the success of <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0410"/>thrift
                        institutions such as savings and loan associations, and the relatively small
                        number of less-developed countries in which such conditions existed, were
                        also noted.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion the Council agreed that in its opinion
                        the Executive Branch should not at this time support the proposal of the
                        Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and that further study should be undertaken by
                        the Council of the problems that would be raised by dollar loans and
                        investments for local currency purposes by U.S. savings and loan
                        associations acting through a Government-created corporation. The Council

                            <item>The U.S. Government needs authority to make balance of payments
                                loans involving long-term commitments, where such loans are required
                                to support sound economic development. We cannot be tied down
                                exclusively to a project approach, although project loans should be
                                the preferred technique where needs can be met in this fashion.
                                Afghanistan and India illustrate situations where present authority

                                    >FY</gloss> 1962. This year’s legislation and legislative
                                history raised certain problems, but we should not hesitate to make
                                sound proposals for next year. The new Administration can decide to
                                adopt or modify such proposals. The <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                                    >DLF</gloss> should be in a position to finance the economic

                                as well as India, in part by means of balance of payments loans if
                                that is what is required. In such cases as India, the level of
                                    <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> lending, combined with PL

                                local currency. It probably does not make sense to relend the local
                                currency at market rates of interest, thus building up even greater
                                accumulations in future years. Probably the best solution is for

                                increasing the resources available to the Inter-American Bank. A

                                in the major grant country programs if political considerations
                                would permit a reduction in the programs for Spain, Israel and

                                currently thought was desired by the State Department. On the

                                arguing that the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> had made bad
                                loans; the Congressman had only contended that the Executive Branch

                                    >DLF</gloss> was going to make loans not strictly tied to

                                or committed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                                thought that the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> should provide
                                more resources to countries like Taiwan and Turkey which have the

                                    >DLF</gloss> should have the authority to provide balance of

                                accumulations. This problem is made worse by relending repayments at
                                the going interest rate thus assuring even larger future
                                accumulations. The problem might be handled by giving <gloss

                                currency grants out of such repayments. The main problem lies with
                                PL 480 local currencies, but local currencies from all sources must
                                be considered together.</item>

                        the death of the project. He recalled his efforts, which appear to be
                        successful, to work out an exchange of letters that would satisfy Rep.

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that the most
                        important thing was to get quick action in either the House or the Senate so
                        that hearings could begin in appropriations committees.</p>
                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName> noted that hearings
                        had begun on the extension of the Development Loan Fund, that the <gloss
                            target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> would be the seventh lending institution (4
                        international and 3 by the United States), and that the apparent duplication
                        would have an adverse effect on the Development Loan Fund. The President
                        noted the psychological factor involved in the desires of various regions to
                        have such an institution tailored to its own situation. The President
                        stressed the coordinating function of the National Advisory Council, and he
                        said he had talked with Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        and others on the possible desirability of setting up within the State
                        Department an individual to act as full-time Executive Secretary for the

                            >Anderson</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>
                        was simply a third “window” inside the World Bank, and that behind all of
                        the windows was the desk of <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Eugene
                            Black</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName> then inquired why the
                            <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> should grant loans if all three
                        windows of the World Bank declined. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said that the World Bank could not make “political”
                        loans which were sometimes necessary, as in the case of a recent $100
                        million to Argentina. The President added that these may very well be good
                        loans, that certain soft loans had to be made and the U.S. had to make them.
                        He went on forcefully to emphasize his efforts to wage peace, something that
                        could not just be done with pretty words; instead, these newly developing
                        nations had to have the chance to make a living. He <pb n="383"
                            xml:id="pg_383" facs="0415"/>asserted that if the <gloss
                            target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> were scrapped it would become necessary to
                        revise extensively our security arrangements and perhaps even be required to
                        fall back to some “citadel” concept. The importance of this type of activity
                        had to be recognized and approved even if it lacked any specific pressure
                        group to help it along. Sen. <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName>
                        asked about the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> arrangement for using
                        local currencies and noted that Senators Lausche, Capehart and others would
                        move to strike out that provision. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> explained the arrangement whereby some of the
                        contributions of a country could be in this local currency. This was a means
                        of making the best of a bad situation where any country was not financially
                        able to make a contribution in hard currency. Also, there would sometimes be
                        occasions for using local currencies and this would be of benefit to the
                        United States, however infrequent, since we presently have soft currency
                        holdings without opportunity to use them. The President suggested that Sec.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> approach Sen. Lausche
                        and present the case for this arrangement.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of the visit was to enlist the Secretary’s support in having Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Eugene Black</persName>, in his capacity as
                        President of <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>, agree to join a
                        consultative board composed of Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName>,
                        Secretary General <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0416"/>of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, Mr. <persName>Paul</persName> Hoffman,
                        Managing Director of its Special Fund and Mr. David Owen in charge of
                        technical assistance at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This Board
                        would be established by an exchange of letters between Messrs. Hammarskjold
                        and <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> agreeing to meet informally
                        from time to time to discuss in a general way the operations of <gloss
                            target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> indicated that the
                        main argument for such a Board on the U.S. side was a political one inasmuch
                        as it would create the image of a close relationship between the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> and
                        thus help our delegation at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to beat
                        back the <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> argument. Several
                        countries, among them Holland and the Scandinavian Nations, would find this
                        a convenient reason for dropping their former strong support for <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, and in fact, such a Board would lay
                        to rest any important <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> agitation.
                        The second political argument in favor of such a Board would be that it will
                        make the Western Nations show up favorably in relation to the Russians who
                        are not members of <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> has discussed this
                        matter informally with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>. The latter had indicated
                        that he saw no difficulties provided Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1"
                            >Black</persName> approved.</p>
                    <p>For tactical reasons, the U.S. Delegation at <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> would like to have Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName>
                        make announcement of this Board in Geneva on July 11. This would forestall
                        those who intend to press for <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>
                        during the Economic and Social Council Meeting in the Fall.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> will send us a letter
                        outlining this plan and suggesting the wording for the terms of reference
                        establishing the Board. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> will try to meet with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> during the week beginning June 13 to

                    <p>The Chairman of the Council, in April, asked that a Special Committee of

                        agencies, in accordance with the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, as amended.
                        The Deputies have held ten meetings and have reached a general consensus on

                                    <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans for a provision which
                                would permit the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>, under
                                appropriate circumstances, to convert to dollars local currency
                                receipts from payments of interest and amortization, or to use local

                                    >DLF</gloss> projects. This right was to be exercised if and
                                when, in the future, the borrowing country’s situation had improved
                                greatly through the discovery and exploitation of natural resources,
                                improvement of production and trade, and other factors in its
                                balance of payments which markedly increased its capacity to service
                                loans in foreign exchange, or to finance some exports to other
                                developing areas. Part of the problem was to specify the conditions
                                under which the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> might exercise
                                the “dollar option”.</p>
                            <p>The Deputies concluded that it would be desirable for <gloss

                                agreements”, supplemental to individual loan agreements, relating to
                                the uses of local currencies received in payment of principal and
                                interest on <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans. A draft model

                            aspects of the problem, concluded that the <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                                >DLF</gloss> should, in appropriate cases, make loans partially or
                            totally repayable in dollars. It is their view that dollar repayment is
                            not indicated for all cases of <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>
                            loans, but that it may be required when a country has reasonable
                            prospects for servicing dollar loans in the future, particularly where
                            it does not receive loans at the present time from the Export-Import
                            Bank or the International Bank. The Deputies, however, realized that it
                            was difficult to set in advance the precise conditions under which
                            partial dollar payment should be required or to determine in advance all
                            of the circumstances which might be relevant. Accordingly, the paper in
                            Appendix C<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">Not printed.</note> represents a
                            general consensus of the majority of the Committee, expressed in the
                            form of conclusions to a study paper but formal Council action is not
                            recommended at this time.</item>

                            currencies cannot be supplied from non-inflationary sources by countries
                            to which the extension of loans by the <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                                >DLF</gloss> would be in accordance with U.S. policies. Under some
                            circumstances, particularly when the International Monetary Fund has
                            agreed upon a stabilization program in the country, the financing of
                            local currency expenditures from external resources may be required to
                            avoid interference with the stabilization program and so adding to
                            inflationary pressures in the country. The Deputies believe, however,
                            that such local currency financing must be considered carefully and
                            should take into <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0419"/>account the
                            willingness and ability of the country to devise and apply measures
                            which would reduce its dependence upon foreign exchange sources for
                            desirable investment in development projects. The general consensus of
                            the Deputies (Appendix D)<note n="3" xml:id="d201fn3">Not
                                printed.</note> is expressed in the form of conclusions of the study
                            made, but they do not recommend a formal Council action at this time in
                            view of the difficulties in formulating a precise policy and specifying
                            all of the necessary conditions appropriate to local currency
                            financing.</item>

                            three groups. Since, however, not all countries were included in the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have been giving further
                        thought to the subject of the appropriate relationship between the
                        International Development Association and the United Nations, concerning
                        which you requested my views. As you know, I am strongly opposed to the
                        creation of any Consultative Board or Advisory Committee of the kind which
                        the U.N. Secretary General has proposed to me. I believe that the basic
                        defect in this proposal is that such a Board or Committee would make it
                        appear that <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> and the Bank itself were
                        subject to political influences, and this would, in my judgment, have a
                        seriously adverse effect upon the marketability of the Bank’s bonds.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, I have always considered that it would be necessary and
                        desirable to establish a close and effective working relationship between
                            <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> and the United Nations, such as
                        exists between the Bank and the United Nations, and I would have no
                        objection to an appropriate formalization of such relationships.</p>
                    <p>As you may know, for some time representatives of the Secretary General, the
                        U.N. Technical Assistance Board, the U.N. Special Fund and the Bank have
                        been meeting, every few months, to exchange information about their
                        respective economic development and technical assistance activities, for the
                        purpose of coordinating their programs in those fields. The meetings have
                        proved extremely valuable, I believe, in helping to avoid duplication and
                        overlapping of effort, and in enabling the agencies concerned to plan more
                        efficiently than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
                    <p>A similar arrangement would, in my opinion, be equally appropriate in the
                        case of <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>. Since the arrangement involving
                        the Bank was developed subsequent to the conclusion of the agreement between
                        the Bank and the United Nations,<note n="1" xml:id="d203fn1">Presumably the
                                <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> articles of agreement.</note>
                        it is not specifically mentioned in that document and has, in fact, never
                        been formalized. However, in the case of <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                        >IDA</gloss>, I think it would be unobjectionable if provision were included
                        in the formal agreement between <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> and the
                        United Nations for the creation of a liaison committee, to be composed of
                        the <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0424"/>Secretary General of the United
                        Nations and the President of the Bank and of <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss>, or their representatives, which the Executive Chairman of
                        the U.N. Technical Assistance Board and the Managing Director of the U.N.
                        Special Fund, or their representatives, would be invited to join as full
                        participants. The function of this liaison committee would be to enable the
                        Bank and <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> to keep the other participants,
                        and the other participants to keep the Bank and <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss>, fully informed on their current programs and future plans
                        in areas of common interest and concern, thereby assuring coordination of
                        their activities in the fields of economic development and technical
                        assistance. Such a provision would establish on a formal basis, and would
                        include <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> within, the informal liaison
                        arrangements presently in effect between the Bank and the other participants
                        in the proposed liaison committee.</p>
                    <p>I feel confident that the Bank’s Executive Directors would agree to a
                        proposal along these lines, but there has been no occasion as yet to discuss
                        it with them and until I do so, at the appropriate time, the suggestion I
                        have made is necessarily a tentative and personal one.</p>
                    <p>You have indicated that the United States delegation to the current session
                        of the Economic and Social Council may want to take some initiative in
                        connection with this matter. I feel strongly that this would be inadvisable.
                        In the first place, the staff of the Bank has not yet had an opportunity to
                        discuss the problem in any detail with the U.N. Secretariat, and almost all
                        of the U.N. officials concerned are now in Geneva. I believe that the
                        Secretary General and his staff would take it very much amiss, and that it
                        would cloud our relationship, if any specific proposal were advanced with my
                        implicit endorsement before we had had a chance to clear it with them. In
                        the second place, as I have pointed out, I have not discussed this matter
                        with my own board and would certainly wish to do so before there were any
                        public discussion of a position which I would be understood to have
                        accepted. Finally, and most important, I feel sure that in the event of a
                        United States initiative, the other members of <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> would take it for granted that the proposal had been
                        discussed with the Bank’s management in advance. In a sense, therefore, by
                        making any proposal the United States might be regarded as in effect
                        speaking for <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>, an impression that I know
                        we would both be anxious to avoid.</p>
                    <p>In my judgment, the proper time for this whole matter to be negotiated and
                        discussed is the fall, after <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> comes into
                        being, when the formal agreement between <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>
                        and the United Nations will be drafted and brought before <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> for approval. I would hope that this
                        would be the position taken by the United States delegation at the current
                        session of <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>.</p>

                        86th Congress, approved on June 30, 1960,<note n="1" xml:id="d204fn1">The

                        authorized the President to accept membership for the United States in the
                        International Development Association. On July 14, 1960, legislation
                        providing the necessary appropriation<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">P.L.
                            86–651, the Supplemental Appropriation Act, 1960; 74 Stat. 509.</note>
                        was approved.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, acceptance of membership by the United States is now in order.
                        Although the Articles of Agreement provide that the institution may not come
                        into being before September 15, 1960, in my opinion an early signature by
                        the United States would be helpful in encouraging prompt acceptance of
                        membership by the other countries.</p>
                    <p>The Agreement establishing the Association provides that membership shall be
                        accepted by signing the Agreement and depositing with the International Bank
                        for Reconstruction and Development an instrument setting forth that the
                        United States has accepted the Agreement in accordance with its own laws and
                        has taken the steps necessary to enable it to fulfill all of its obligations
                        under the Agreement.</p>
                    <p>I believe it would be appropriate for me to represent the United States in
                        carrying out these steps. This would follow the precedent under which the
                        Secretary of the Treasury has signed on behalf of the United States the
                        Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, the International
                        Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance
                        Corporation, and the Inter-American Development Bank.</p>
                    <p>If you concur, I request an Instrument of Acceptance and a document according
                        me full powers to sign the Agreement and to deposit the Instrument of
                        Acceptance on behalf of the United States be prepared for submission to the
                        President for his approval and signature. A draft Instrument of Acceptance

                            and IFC</hi></p>
                    <p>The 1960 annual meetings of the Boards of Governors of the International
                        Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
                        and the International Finance Corporation, which took place in Washinton
                        September 26–30, went smoothly. As expected, attention centered on the state
                        of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economy, the international
                        balance-of-payments, and on aid to less-developed countries.</p>
                    <p>The International Development Association came into being at the beginning of
                        the meetings, as a result of a sufficient number of countries completing the
                        process of ratification. The <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>,
                        establishment of which was endorsed at last year’s meeting, will provide aid
                        for <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0427"/>development projects in
                        less-developed countries on more flexible repayment terms than have been
                        available from international organizations.</p>
                    <p>Quite a few of the Governors from the less-developed countries pointed out
                        that now that the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>’s reserve against
                        losses has passed the $500 million mark, as against loans outstanding of
                        less than $3 billion, it is time to consider a reduction in the <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>’s one percent charge for this reserve.
                        The President of the IFC recommended that the Corporation’s charter be
                        amended to permit the IFC to invest in equities. No opposition was expressed
                        by any of the Governors. The Chairman said that the matter should be
                        considered by the Executive Directors who would bring it before the
                        Governors upon completion of their studies and recommendations (without
                        necessarily waiting until the next annual meeting).</p>
                    <p>As usual, the Governors considered the annual reports of the institutions.
                        Nigeria’s applications for membership in the Bank, Fund and IFC were
                        approved as were Nepal’s applications for membership in the Bank and Fund
                        and Sudan’s for the IFC. Approval was also given to Yugoslavia’s application
                        for an increase in its quota in the Fund and in its subscription to the
                        Bank.</p>

                        emphatically pointed out by many speakers that there should be an increase
                        in long-term loans to less-developed countries, particularly by those
                        countries accumulating large foreign exchange surpluses, not only because of
                        the need for such loans on the part of the less-developed countries, but
                        also as a means of assisting in reaching a state of more equilibrium in the
                        international balance of payments. In this context Germany was specifically
                        mentioned by Mr. <persName>Jacobsson</persName>, and by the <gloss

                    <p>The German response was favorable in tone and recognized Germany’s
                        obligation, but lacked specificity. Minister Erhard said that the means of
                        raising the necessary funds for development aid is being discussed within
                        the Federal Republic. He reiterated a statement which the Federal Government
                        and the Central Bank made a few weeks ago that appreciation of the
                        deutschemark was not one of the intended measures. Erhard maintained, as
                        Germany did last year, that there needs to be better coordination of aid to
                        less-developed countries. He remarked that the Development Assistance Group
                        is now <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0428"/>established<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d206fn2">The Development Assistance Group, established in Paris

                        information on the resources needed and available for development aid.
                        However, he said, two other goals Germany has in mind remain to be achieved:
                        1) voluntary consultations and individual development projects and 2) if the
                        circumstances of the individual case so indicate, the combination of several
                        suppliers of capital for joint operations. He noted that these tasks are
                        outside the scope of the DAG, but welcomed the fact that the International
                        Bank has made itself available for consultations on development projects to
                        be carried out bilaterally and is already working energetically to bring
                        about joint operations. Erhard expressed hope that there would be an
                        expansion of these encouraging initial results. [Here follows discussion of
                        the International Monetary Fund.] <hi rend="italic">International Bank</hi>
                        W.A.B. Iliff, Vice-President of the International Bank, struck several
                        optimistic notes in his address to the Governors. He noted that in the last
                        three years <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> lending has almost
                        equalled the total of its first ten years. The cumulative total of Bank
                        lending now exceeds $5,000 million in 53 countries. Ten years ago, its
                        available funds came almost entirely from the paid-in capital of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Canada and from $250 million in borrowed
                        money, all of which had been raised in the American market. Five years ago,
                        while the Bank’s sources of finance had taken on a more international
                        complexion, the paid-in subscription of the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>, amounting to $635 million, exceeded the sum of all usable
                        subscriptions from the other members. Today, the international character of
                        the Bank is thoroughly established. Members’ paid-in capital available for
                        lending—exclusive of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        subscription—amounts to more than $1,000 million. Of the Bank’s outstanding
                        funded debt which now exceeds $2,000 million, more than half is held outside
                        the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>—a very remarkable change from five
                        years ago. Ten years—or even five years ago—it was still largely a dollar
                        bank; today the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> is in every sense of
                        the word an international bank. Its securities have been established in the
                        money markets of Belgium, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as well as the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>. Investors in more than 40 countries are holders of Bank
                        securities. Also, the over-all financial position of the Bank continues to
                        grow stronger. A further $85.6 million was added to its reserves during the
                        past fiscal year and these reserves now stand at more than half a billion
                        dollars.</p>
                    <p>While it is not easy to look into the future, Iliff said there does not
                        appear to be any shortage in sight of development capital prepared to move
                        on conventional terms. The volume of private international lending and
                        investment in foreign securities has been growing; foreign <pb n="397"
                            xml:id="pg_397" facs="0429"/>bonds publicly issued in the major capital
                        markets during 1959 and 1958 amounted to three times the total floated in
                        1952 and 1953—and this exclusive of refunding operations. This expansion has
                        been marked by an increase in the number of countries able to invest abroad,
                        notably those countries of Western Europe which have experienced sustained
                        improvement on domestic and foreign account. Even the recent pattern of
                        interest rates suggests the possibility of a continuing growth in the supply
                        of conventional development capital, according to Iliff. While attention
                        today is directed to the recent rise in long-term interest rates in Europe,
                        it should not be overlooked that European interest rates are significantly
                        lower than they were in the peak of the earlier European boom in 1957.
                        Moreover, since 1957, controls over capital movements have been eased. These
                        are indications that the supply of capital in Europe has expanded
                        substantially in the past three years, giving still further support to the
                        view that capital flows to the low income countries can continue to
                        increase.</p>
                    <p>However, the past decade has also brought some new problems which are taxing
                        both resources and ingenuity, Iliff pointed out. The first of these is that
                        of the new countries—those to whom national independence comes, in many
                        instances, with little or no preparation or warning. In some of these
                        countries we know now that the first roadblocks on the path to development
                        are the lack of the most basic services of government, particularly adequate
                        education. Somewhere men and women must be found, or trained, to build the
                        very foundations without which economic and social progress cannot be built.
                        All development agencies—national, regional and international—will have to
                        stretch the limit of their resources and ingenuity to meet the demand. The
                            <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> hopes and expects to do its share,
                        but Iliff stressed that something more than the existing forms of technical
                        assistance is required.</p>
                    <p>The second problem arises from the fact that once a country embarks on a
                        development program in earnest and sets out to find capital to finance it,
                        that country can, with great rapidity, reach the point where its ability to
                        borrow foreign capital on conventional terms is very limited in comparison
                        with the amount it could effectively employ. Iliff pointed out that this is
                        certainly the case with India and Pakistan today and it may already be the
                        case of some other countries. India’s external debt already creates an
                        onerous burden on her economy and, if hard loan continues to be piled on
                        hard loan, the service and repayment burdens will very quickly reach an
                        intolerable level. Clearly, if the tempo of progress in the underdeveloped
                        world is not dangerously retarded, some other forms of development financing
                        must be made available on a substantial scale. “The free world has come to
                        realize this and is experimenting with a whole orchestra of <pb n="398"
                            xml:id="pg_398" facs="0430"/>novel financial instruments—bilateral and
                        multilateral ... .<note n="3" xml:id="d206fn3">Ellipsis in the source
                            text.</note> The objective is to get some harmony out of these
                        instruments. The risk is that—if we are not careful—we could produce not an
                        orchestra, but nothing more than a haphazard ensemble making quite
                        discordant noises.”</p>
                    <p>In considering these problems one can discern a trend in the international
                        community in the direction of greater reliance on the multilateral approach,
                        Iliff said. Today’s trend differs importantly from similar trends in the
                        past; the search now is not for once-and-for-all solutions to the broad
                        problems of development; rather it is a search for solutions to specific
                        problems—solutions which can be fitted together like pieces of a jig-saw
                        puzzle to make a more hopeful prospect for a picture of peace and human
                        betterment. He added that the historic transformation which is going on in
                        the underdeveloped world today defies any general “solution”; but it does
                        offer infinite possibilities to the practitioners of economic development.
                        “By marrying the needs of development with international cooperation, more
                        and more statesmen the world over are trying to make something of these
                        infinite possibilities. Instead of searching for the elusive grand design,
                        they are seizing on specific development opportunities and trying to use
                        these as a means of promoting harmony and tranquility within and among
                        nations.” In this context, he mentioned the recent Indus Waters settlement,
                        the Indian and Pakistan consortiums, the coming into being of the new
                        International Development Association, the formation of the Inter-American
                        Development Bank, and the movement to amend the function and membership of
                        the Organization for European Economic Cooperation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">International Development Association</hi> The
                        International Development Association came into being September 26 as an
                        affiliate of the World Bank. By that date fifteen countries with total
                        subscriptions of the equivalent of $626 million had met the membership
                        requirements. If all of the members of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                            >IBRD</gloss> join <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>, its initial
                        resources will be the equivalent of $1,000 million, of which the equivalent
                        of $787 million will be available on a fully convertible basis. The first
                        meeting of the Executive Directors of the <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss>, representing its member countries, will be held later in
                        the fall. At that time <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> will formally
                        begin operations.</p>
                    <p>The new organization will provide development finance to the less-developed
                        areas of the world included within its membership on terms more flexible and
                        bearing less heavily on their balance of payments than conventional terms,
                        thereby furthering development objectives and supplementing the activities
                        of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. A considerable degree of
                        flexibility is given to <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> by its Articles
                        of Agreement, <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0431"/>both in the purposes
                        for which it may provide finance and in the terms on which it may make
                        loans. <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> will finance a wider range of
                        projects than the Bank, but since both agencies will have the same
                        management, it is to be expected that <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>
                        will maintain the same high standard as the Bank with respect to planning,
                        management and financing of the projects which it assists.</p>
                    <p>A unique feature of <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> is the division of
                        member countries into two groups for purposes of subscription of funds.
                        Subscriptions will be payable over a five-year period, and the countries in
                        both groups will pay 10 percent of their initial subscriptions in gold or
                        freely convertible currencies. One group—the 17 more industrialized member
                        countries of the Bank—will pay the remaining 90 percent in five equal
                        installments in gold or freely convertible currencies; the other group— the
                        51 less-developed countries—will pay their 90 percent in their national
                        currencies, which <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> will not be free to
                        convert into other currencies or to use to finance exports from the country
                        concerned without its consent.</p>

                        also signed the Articles of Agreement but still have to complete other

                    <p><hi rend="italic">International Finance Corporation</hi> In the four years
                        since it has been in operation, the IFC, which provides capital to private
                        enterprises in less-developed areas where private investors put in an equal
                        amount or more, has made investments in 17 countries and has investigated
                        projects in 17 others. As of June 30, 1960 it had made a total of 33
                        investments, amounting to more than $42 million. This year saw 13 new
                        investments in nine countries totaling $21,747,000, with first investments
                        being made in Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, Tanganyika, Finland and Italy.</p>
                    <p>The IFC has observed the growing interest of business and financial
                        investors, both local and foreign, in the opportunity for private industry
                        in the developing countries. Though aware of the obstacles and risks
                        involved, the IFC is convinced that there are corresponding attractions and
                        rewards. In the developing areas are growing markets, untapped raw materials
                        and abundant labor able to acquire modern skills. For efficiently managed
                        enterprises, potential profits are greater than in the highly competitive
                        industrialized countries, As evidence of its conviction that the rewards can
                        outweigh the risks, the IFC points out that it is investing in the
                        developing areas, sharing the risks and participating in the potential
                        returns.</p>
                    <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0432"/>
                    <p>The IFC notes that there is an unquestioned trend toward joint ventures under
                        international and local sponsorship, based on growing evidence that the
                        advantages outweigh the difficulties. It stresses that today’s modern
                        operations call not only for complicated technical skills but also for
                        executive management capable of dealing with the more complex problems of
                        planning, financing, taxes, labor and public relations, advancing techniques
                        and the development of new products. Regardless of the special difficulties
                        involved in introducing new techniques into the developing areas, IFC
                        President Garner emphasized that “the sound principles of business and
                        finance are the same everywhere.”</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the most important problem confronting the Corporation is that of
                        investment in equity securities. This problem has become clear only after
                        considerable experimentation on the part of the Corporation with convertible
                        debentures, stock options, and other techniques. To properly perform its
                        function, the Corporation needs new tools, according to President Garner,
                        and he is advocating that the Charter be amended so as to enable the
                        Corporation to invest in capital stock of private enterprises.</p>

                    <p>The Development Assistance Group of capital exporting countries had its third
                        meeting in Washington just after the annual <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                            >IBRD</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting and, as
                        prearranged, concentrated on pre-investment technical assistance activities
                        for less-developed countries and the relationship of these activities to
                        development planning and programming. Also, the country representatives
                        informed the Group of developments in their aid policies, programs and
                        institutions. The intention of several countries to increase their
                        contributions to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Special Fund and the
                        Expanded Technical Assistance Program was announced, and hope was expressed
                        that the total annual resources of these two programs would soon reach the
                        target figure of $100 million.</p>
                    <p>The meeting, which took place October 3–5, was attended by representatives of
                        all the members—Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands,
                        Portugal, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Commission.
                        Representatives of various <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and other
                        international organizations participated in the discussion of pre-investment
                        technical assistance. Mr. Thorkil Kristensen, Secretary General Designate of
                        Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (<gloss
                            target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>), attended for the first time and
                        stressed his desire to facilitate the transition of the DAG to a committee
                        of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> to be called the Development
                        Assistance Committee. He emphasized the importance <pb n="401"
                            xml:id="pg_401" facs="0433"/>of consultation among the principal capital
                        exporters to ensure that the flow of funds to the less-developed countries
                        is both adequate and effective.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> used the occasion to have informal
                        discussions with other capital-exporting countries, outside the DAG meeting,
                        on the importance of increasing Western aid to various countries,
                        particularly the Congo and Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>The next meeting of the DAG will be in London in the spring of 1961.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Pre-investment Technical Assistance</hi> The main topic for
                        discussion at this meeting was pre-investment technical assistance to the
                        less-developed countries, and various international organizations were
                        invited to send representatives to participate in the discussion.
                        Represented were the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, including its
                        Special Fund, the Expanded Technical Assistance Program and <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> regional economic commissions; the <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>; the OAS; the IDB; the European
                        Productivity Agency; and the Commission on Technical Assistance in Africa
                        South of the Sahara.</p>
                    <p>The discussion centered around four topics: technical assistance for economic
                        development policies and planning; linking the results of pre-investment
                        technical assistance to operations of capital lending institutions; the role
                        of national and international organizations; and coordination of
                        pre-investment technical assistance activities. There was general agreement
                        on the importance of having competent governmental and other institutions in
                        the less developed countries in the field of development programming and
                        economic policy formulation. Stress was placed on the need for integrated
                        country development programs based on adequate resource surveys and on the
                        shortage of qualified personnel in the less-developed countries at the
                        planning, managerial and technical levels. The view was expressed that
                        greater priority should be attached to intensive training programs on a
                        local and regional basis, as well the enlargement of opportunities for
                        training in the more advanced countries. The condition under which foreign
                        nationals could best provide effective assistance in national planning was
                        discussed.</p>
                    <p>Two aspects of the problem of linking the results of pre-investment technical
                        assistance to operations of lending agencies were discussed inconclusively:
                        the possibility of standardizing feasibility and engineering surveys and the
                        difficulty of relating those surveys. The <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                            >IBRD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> have not found it
                        possible in their operations to attempt to standardize the requirements for
                        surveys, according to the representatives of these agencies. Other delegates
                        commented that the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> type activity was
                        principally concerned with large loans for basic development purposes and
                        did not cover the problem of smaller loans or of meeting the requirements of
                        private foreign capital. The subject will be studied further.</p>
                    <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0434"/>
                    <p>The discussion of the role of national and international organizations
                        indicated that both types of agencies have important roles to play in
                        technical assistance. International programs frequently are more acceptable
                        to recipient countries and more appropriate for projects which affect
                        several countries, in countries having great political instability, or in
                        situations where conflict is possible between political considerations and
                        technical views. The overriding consideration is the voluntary choice of the
                        recipient government in selection of a national or an international agency
                        to provide assistance. The need for greater coordination between bilateral
                        and multilateral programs was stressed.</p>
                    <p>There was agreement on the importance of avoiding competition among different
                        agencies and duplication of work. The international agencies and DAG members
                        agreed to cooperate towards avoiding such competition.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the discussion, the spokesmen for the international organizations
                        emphasized the inadequacy of the present flow of aid for pre-investment
                        activities as compared with that devoted to investment proper, the result

                        transactions by DAG members. Suggestions for improving such information were
                        approved in the form of a resolution. The working party is to remain in

                        assisting the economic development of the less-developed nations. The

                        audiences, the people of less-developed countries and citizens of third
                        countries. Attention was given to the need to increase understanding in
                        member countries of the contribution to development by other member counties
                        and to the need for information to be exchanged to this end. The

                        foreign policy aspects of U.S. national security. Eisenhower requested that
                        the conference examine ways to disseminate information about this topic to
                        the public. For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents

                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted the status of recommendations
                        and accompanying presentations to Congress for the Mutual Assistance
                        program. He cited Eric Johnston’s efforts to develop grass-roots support. He
                        stated that the carry-over for “pipeline” purposes had been reduced from $6
                        billion to less than $3 billion this year. It will be reduced further in the
                        next two years to a bare minimum. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> hoped that the Defense Department could advance the
                        timing of its part of the Mutual Security budget preparations so that
                        specific programs could be developed in time for Congressional
                        presentations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> expected that problems
                        involving the coordination of the Development Loan Fund with the
                        Export-Import Bank would be worked out very shortly. He also noted how the
                        slowness of other countries in submitting detailed applications for loans
                        had held back the program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed to the need for
                        giving attention to the problem of the mounting level of local currencies
                        held by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> citizens, a matter causing

                        that State might soon recommend the establishment of a Cabinet-level
                        Committee on this.</p>
                    <p>The President again expressed his concern with the problem of providing
                        almost unlimited amounts of local currencies to traveling Congressmen and
                        their staffs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> stated that
                        the Executive Branch had no discretion in this matter for which the
                        responsibility rested squarely with the Congress. The President asked that
                        the matter be reviewed, particularly as to any Executive responsibility for
                        stating publicly the amounts disbursed.</p>

                    <p>At 1:00 p.m. on January 27 the President gave a luncheon in the State Dining
                        Room for the persons indicated on the enclosure.<note n="1" xml:id="d214fn1"
                            >Not printed.</note></p>
                    <p>At 2:00 p.m. the President opened the discussion, explaining that the general
                        idea of the luncheon was to develop public support for the Mutual Security
                        program, then asked Mr. Eric Johnston to explain the matter more fully to
                        the group. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> stated that he
                        would like to have the Vice President first make a few remarks and then hear
                        from <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Clarence Randall</persName> inasmuch as the
                        group would be meeting with him after the luncheon and would get his views
                        at that time.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that as far as this group was concerned very little
                        could be said that they did not already know. He pointed out that there is
                        no problem whatsoever in getting adequate funds for the military side of the
                        Administration program but that there will be real difficulty on the
                        economic side. The reasons for this difficulty, he said, are political and
                        lack of understanding—political because this is an election year, and
                        therefore a time when defense can be supported and foreign aid cut, and lack
                        of understanding because the public has been inadequately informed. He said
                        it is of great importance, therefore, that we make it absolutely clear to
                        the American people that mutual security is an essential part of the
                        nation’s defense and of our armed strength. He stated the Administration
                        will take that position and has done so in the past, but that this concept
                        is very difficult to get across. He mentioned Korea (citing the casualties
                        and national treasure invested there) and Afghanistan (citing Soviet
                        economic penetration) as examples of critical areas dependent upon United
                        States economic programs. He placed India, Africa, and Latin-America in the
                        same category, saying that our national objective is to maintain their
                        independence which in turn is the greatest enemy to world communism.</p>
                    <p>He stressed how difficult it is to get this concept across to millions of
                        people in the country so that Members of the Congress who themselves
                        acknowledge the need for these programs will be able to support them without
                        facing political reprisal for doing so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> first thanked Eric
                        Johnston for the luncheon and the group for coming to it. He said he could
                        scarcely comprehend the attitude of the business community in respect to the
                        nation’s foreign economic requirements. He said the businessmen willingly
                        accept the <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0442"/>spending of hundreds of
                        millions for added defense but rebel at giving the defense effort a foreign
                        economic foundation to make it work. He pointed to the drive for cutting the
                        budget six months ago as contrasted to the present zeal for more defense
                        spending. He, too, said that it is principally a matter of lack of
                        understanding, observing that every businessman who comes to Washington into
                        a responsible Government position becomes a firm supporter of these programs
                        once he has really grasped their meaning.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> then mentioned that he had
                        just returned from a trip abroad. He pointed out that Laos and Cambodia are
                        places that most businessmen can’t even identify on a map, yet they are the
                        granary of Asia and should they fall to communism, the free world would lose
                        Taiwan, Korea and the Philippines, forcing our defenses back to the Hawaiian
                        Islands. As regards allegations of waste and inefficiency, he said these are
                        almost always a distortion of fact—and pointed anyway to the fact that every
                        great organization makes periodic errors (citing Ford and Inland Steel) yet
                        does not discontinue the needed activity merely because some error has been
                        made. He then stressed the economic threat of the Soviet Union and said that
                        Sputnik is perhaps a “celestial red herring” to divert American attention
                        from the economic warfare being waged and to thrust us into an
                        over-accentuation of military programs. He cited the vast natural resources
                        of the underdeveloped nations and their great potential value as markets for
                        U.S. products, and mentioned the possibility of the Soviet Union
                        deliberately undertaking a program to dislocate the markets of the free
                        world by selling below cost, using 2-½% loans for 40 years, and other such
                        measures. He concluded by calling upon the business community to get
                        strongly behind these programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> then asked Under Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> to comment. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> mentioned an instance in Charlotte,
                        North Carolina, where after speaking to a group there and stressing the fact
                        that since World War II 20 new nations have been born, a lady asked him why
                        the United States let them get away. This, he explained, is clear evidence
                        of the total lack of understanding of the basic world problems facing
                        America. This situation, he said, is what Congressmen face at home, so that
                        clearly the most critical need is to help Congressmen have informed
                        constituencies who recognize the need for these programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> then asked Mr. William
                            Foster<note n="2" xml:id="d214fn2">Executive Vice President, Olin
                            Mathieson Chemical Corporation.</note> to comment. Mr. Foster took
                        exception to the “celestial red herring” figure of speech used by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>, saying that America is
                        thrust today into total war and that Sputnik has grave meaning in itself and
                        therefore is no red herring. He said that one of the important parts of this
                        total war is in the economic area but that on Capitol Hill there is grave
                        difficulty <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0443"/>unless the general
                        public better understands the true nature of the threat and the measures
                        that must be taken to counter it. He cited economic assistance in Europe as
                        an example of success, and mentioned that most of the money is spent at
                        home, not abroad, but that the “give-away” tag is very hard to counteract in
                        the public mind. The Vice President observed that Mr.
                            <persName>Foster</persName> was Acting Chairman of the Gaither
                            Report<note n="3" xml:id="d214fn3">The Report to the President by the

                        emphasis on these economic programs was included as a Gaither Report
                        recommendation. Mr. <persName>Foster</persName> responded that he was not at
                        liberty to comment on the contents of the Gaither Report.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> then asked Director
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> to comment. He said he was
                        happy that the group had assembled because he obviously would be its
                        beneficiary. He pointed out that he spent some three or four years working
                        on weapons of destruction and only recently entered the economic field. He
                        said that he is now more alarmed than he was when he was working on weapons
                        and is deeply convinced that America’s economic programs must be moved
                        forward as quickly as possible.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> mentioned a letter he had
                        received from the United States Representative in Burma, written from
                        Rangoon where there has been a rice crop failure causing great economic
                        distress in Burma. He said loans are being made by Red China and Russia,
                        with Red technicians also entering the country. The U.S. representative said
                        that the Reds are thereby making great strides in Burma. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> said that American businessmen must
                        understand the deep significance of such a development and cited Western
                        Europe and West Berlin as examples of lucrative trade areas saved for free
                        enterprise through economic programs of the past.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> then said he would give
                        the group a brief outline of the program that would be proposed in his
                        office after the luncheon. He said that Foster Dulles, <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName>, amongst others, would speak to
                        this group, followed by a luncheon, the afternoon being devoted to a panel
                        discussion open to questions from the floor. That evening the President is
                        to make a foreign policy address to the nation. On that occasion the leaders
                        of both political parties and other public figures will be at the head
                        table. This will be followed by an extensive TV-radio educational campaign,
                        plus newspaper and magazine articles and special pamphlets. He said the
                        object is to elicit discussion at the grass roots, that it is a wholly
                        non-partisan effort <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0444"/>devoted to
                        making it possible for Congressmen to support the program without facing
                        political defeat. He said it is a crash effort—“a grand effort not a puny
                        one.”</p>
                    <p>The President then said he had one question to pose to the group as
                        representatives of their particular element in American society. He said he
                        might fairly be classified now as a politician. Those present, he said, as
                        businessmen are not political. He said that he had asked, as President, some
                        businessmen to help in such programs as this and had found in them exactly
                        the same instinctive reaction against foreign assistance as the uninformed
                        had. Then, however, he mentioned <persName corresp="#p_HG2">George
                            Humphrey</persName>, saying that when <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> first entered the Cabinet he was strongly opposed
                        to foreign assistance but, being a man who saw great virtue in facts, soon
                        conceded, after learning the facts, that these programs had to be done.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> said, the President
                        commented, that while we must indeed carry out these programs, let’s just be
                        careful in doing so.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked why it is that businessmen who come to Washington
                        are strongly in support of these programs when they leave. He said most
                        businessmen just haven’t studied the problem, even though it is likely to be
                        the critical question of this generation.</p>
                    <p>The President offered one additional thought: he said the Vice President
                        commented that the Congress is always ready to furnish needed military
                        funds. Nothing, he said, could be more untrue, looked at from the standpoint
                        of history. Then he said that six months ago the Congress was a group of
                        great economizers and cut the budget. The object, the President said, was
                        political benefit. Then he stressed that this is not a political
                        proposition. With the same threat in the world, why the sudden change in the
                        Congress? Reason: because of the heat that comes on the Congress from the
                        States. He said that when Eric Johnston told of the Senator who knows these
                        programs are needed but opposes them for political reasons, he almost wanted
                        to put his napkin over his face. He said he couldn’t understand how any man
                        of responsibility could do such a thing—but if this is the situation in
                        America, then we must build a public sentiment that will assure backing for
                        such people to support the program. This, he said, should be the
                        responsibility of all businessmen and every American. He said we cannot have
                        prosperity without security and that we must have friends abroad with whom
                        to trade. He said he could not overemphasize his feeling of deep conviction
                        on this matter and while he thought no one at the table needed convincing,
                        yet he thought they should get their friends to proselyte their friends and
                        bring about in the country a renaissance of conviction and determination to
                        carry through these programs. That kind of effort, he said, will be far more
                        influential than <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0445"/>any sponsored by
                        political persons. He said that he didn’t care who got elected by
                        undertaking this great enterprise; it is totally for America, regardless of
                        party.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> then invited the group to
                        come to his office for an hour’s meeting. The luncheon adjourned at 2:45
                        p.m.</p>

                            the U.S. (which is not advertised), tells a story. So does the fact that
                            in both India and Iran officials want our economic projects to be such
                            as to get the U.S. more credit. My first recommendation, therefore, is
                            that <hi rend="italic">a small percentage of funds be earmarked for
                                projects which will make a definite and favorable impact on the mind

                            erroneous because bricks and mortar which provide a medical school, for
                            instance, are good public relations. The Russians have gone so far as to
                            donate busses and taxi cabs in Kabul and the fact that they paved the

                            <p>In the Orient, over the centuries, man has become adjusted to the
                                prevailing state of affairs, with all its hardships, dangers and
                                diseases, and has relied on religious beliefs to sustain him. It is
                                justifiable to upset all this if by so doing a true improvement is
                                created. But it is wrong to upset it if one problem is merely to be

                            is being welcomed in these countries. They see it as a way to get
                            inventories of natural resources. The creation of this fund has finally
                            convinced some of these officials that capital development cannot be
                            undertaken until there is a real inventory. This therefore tends to
                            postpone demands for capital development, which is one of the arguments

                            such a fund several years ago. In Afghanistan, for example, it is
                            understood that private capital will not presently interest itself in
                            developing oil or uranium resources, for example, until an aerial map
                            has furnished some guide to the lines which development should

                                    <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the
                                Department’s attitude on the latter was to be neutral and willing to
                                accept whatever the Committee decides. He emphasized, however, that
                                the money request had been drawn very tightly and that a reduction
                                of $100 million, or perhaps $200 million at the outside, would be
                                the most the program could stand. In further discussion several
                                Leaders thought a single bill most desirable since it thus precluded
                                the need for fighting the battle on two occasions instead of one,
                                and also allowed the strong points of the economic program to aid
                                passage of the military program and vice versa. Speaker Martin
                                suggested that the Department furnish statistics on domestic
                                benefits that result from the program.</p>
                            <p>“The President stated firmly his belief that it was more important to
                                put adequate funds into this program than to keep searching for new

                    <p>In May and June, the White House and the Department of State closely followed
                        congressional action on the administration’s Mutual Security appropriations
                        request. The House Foreign Affairs Committee reported the authorizing
                        legislation, H.R. 12181, on May 7. H.R. 12181 cut $339 million from
                        President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s Mutual
                        Security budget, including $100 million from the President’s Contingency
                        Fund; for text, see U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Foreign
                        Affairs, <hi rend="italic">Selected Executive Session Hearings of the
                            Committee, 1957–1960,</hi> volume XIX, <hi rend="italic">Mutual Security

                        legislative leadership meeting, Under Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated he hoped the Senate would
                        authorize the full $200 million requested for the Contingency Fund; “it
                        might then be possible to salvage $150 million in Conference.” In response
                        to comments on the inadvisability of separating military and economic
                        assistance appropriations, Eisenhower “emphasized that both programs were
                        devoted to a single purpose: the security of the United States.”

                    <p>The House of Representatives passed H.R. 12181 and sent it to the Senate May
                        14. Senators Wiley and <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName>
                        reported at the May 19 legislative leadership meeting that the Senate
                        Foreign Relations Committee was inclined to restore the full amount of the
                        President’s request to the Mutual Security Program. Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_KWF1">Knowland</persName>, however, believed the situation
                        in the full Senate was less favorable. The President reiterated his belief
                        that cuts in the defense budget were preferable to reductions in Mutual
                        Security. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.) On May 23, the Senate Foreign
                        Relations Committee voted to restore $110 million to the bill, still $229
                        million less than the President’s original request. The Committee also
                        approved amending the Mutual Defense Control Act of 1951 (Battle Act) to
                        permit aid to any country except the Soviet Union, <pb n="419"

                    <p>The need for maximum Senate support for the Mutual Security Program was
                        restated at the June 5 legislative leadership meeting. It was also noted
                        that the administration favored increased flexibility in administering the
                        program, but felt amendment of the Battle Act should be handled in separate
                        legislation. (Letter from <persName corresp="#p_MLA1">Minnich</persName> to

                        That day the Senate deleted the Battle Act amendment from the Mutual
                        Security bill. The following day, it adopted the bill with some amendments
                        from the floor; total funding for the program remained at the level the
                        Foreign Relations Committee had recommended, however.</p>
                    <p>Senate and House conferees reported a compromise version of H.R. 12181 on
                        June 26, providing $3,031,400,000, $266.5 million less than the President’s
                        request. (H. Rept. 2038; for text, see U.S. House of Representatives,

                        That day, Jack Z. Anderson, Eisenhower’s Administrative Assistant, briefed
                        the President on the progress of the Mutual Security appropriation
                        legislation, H.R. 13192. At 11:35 a.m., he gave Eisenhower a memorandum
                        outlining cuts the House Appropriations Committee had made in the bill
                        (Eisenhower Library, White House Office Files, OF 133–L, 1958), and noted
                        the Department of State had suggested the President telephone Congressman
                        Martin and Speaker of the House <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                            >Rayburn</persName> to request their support for restoring the funds.

                        13192. The President also recommended that <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"

                        been unsuccessful in his attempts to change members’ minds, but was
                        continuing his efforts. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"

                        Committee reported H.R. 13192, having cut $872 million from the President’s
                        request. (H. Rept. 2048, Eighty-fifth Congress, Second Session) Eisenhower
                        released a statement emphasizing the importance of these funds and
                        describing himself “deeply disturbed” by the Committee’s action. “It is my
                        hope and belief,” he concluded, “that this action of the House
                        Appropriations Committee will not be the final action of the House of
                        Representatives or of the Congress.” For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public

                        legislation. H.R. 12181 thus became P.L. 85–477, the Mutual Security Act of

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mutual Security</hi>—An extensive discussion covered
                        Republican and Democratic attitudes in the House, the need for extensive
                        public support, and from the Administration viewpoint the importance of the
                        program to resisting Communist inroads abroad. The President cited the two
                        hour conversation he had had the day before with the Shah of Iran.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d220fn2">A memorandum of this conversation is scheduled
                            for publication in volume XII.</note> The Shah made very clear what
                        could happen from Communist inroads if the free world didn’t maintain its
                        efforts. Given time, the Shah would have the Iranian economy in sufficiently
                        good shape to withstand communism on its own. The fact that there was at
                        least this much encouragement was strictly the result of our mutual security
                        assistance in past years. Not to be forgotten was the strength of the
                        Communists in Iran only five years before. But, said the President, it’s
                        disheartening to work so hard with a country only to have the Appropriations
                        Committee threaten to wreck the effort.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stressed that no areas of
                        the globe had been lost to Communism since 1952, but that happy situation
                        could well change if the House Committee cuts were allowed to stand. The
                        U.S. would not be able to put funds into each of the critical areas. It
                        would be almost serving notice that we would have to take some losses.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt that once Republicans
                        forced the issue on the important points, the Democrats would have to give
                        some support.</p>
                    <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0453"/>
                    <p>When mention was made of Rep. <persName corresp="#p_POE1"
                        >Passman</persName>’s effective allegations of waste in Laos, a situation
                        which had long since been corrected, the Vice President commented that if it
                        hadn’t been for similar “waste” in Iran some years ago, the Shah would not
                        be visiting the United States today.</p>
                    <p>Rep. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">John Taber</persName> pointed out that on
                        various critical votes taken in Committee, the most support forthcoming from
                        the Democrats was seven votes out of thirty, whereas as many as thirteen
                        Republicans out of twenty supported the President’s request. He thought
                        Speaker <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> was playing the same
                        old game as last year and would deliver the Democratic votes against the
                        restorations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Taber</persName> said that Rep.
                        Rooney was doing his best for the program, but it was not good enough.</p>
                    <p>At issue were three things: (1) a $75 million increase in defense support,
                        (2) increasing the Development Loan Fund from $300 million to $500 million,
                        and (3) increasing the President’s contingency fund by $55 million. Approval
                        of all three would still be $545 million short of the President’s
                        request.</p>
                    <p>Rep. Arends said he had begun a poll of Republicans, and thus far it had
                        shown a majority of responders favoring the first but not the other two.</p>
                    <p>The President said he was really frustrated when one Appropriations Committee
                        action was to push an unwanted billion dollars at him while another was to
                        take away desperately needed funds.</p>
                    <p>Rep. <persName corresp="#p_VJM1">Vorys</persName> pointed out that Rep.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTE1">Tom Morgan</persName> was lobbying his
                        colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee to support the bill but would
                        not commit himself.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President feared that at least two of our Latin American neighbors
                        would be oriented within two years towards the Soviet bloc unless we got the
                        Development Loan Fund Money to assist in their projects. The President added
                        that he had heard from a number of businessmen that investments of private
                        capital abroad would slow up unless the Federal government effort also
                        continued.</p>
                    <p>Much attention was given in the discussion to the possibility that the Eric
                        Johnson Committee would be able to encourage Congressional support.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would invite Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                            >Rayburn</persName> for breakfast or lunch for a discussion of the
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>As for Senate action, Sen. <persName corresp="#p_KWF1">Knowland</persName>
                        foresaw some difficulty, since the Senate cannot be expected to appropriate
                        the full amounts approved in the authorization bill. Sen. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName> noted that the toughest
                        opponents of Mutual Security are right in the Appropriations Committee. Sen.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> stated his concurrence in
                        this discouraging outlook, but Sen. <persName corresp="#p_DEM1"

                            <persName corresp="#p_KWF1">Knowland</persName> thought it would be
                        helpful to Senate leaders, especially in Conference, if the level of
                        appropriations made by the House could be gotten somewhat above the
                        Committee proposal, even if this meant having to settle for something less
                        than was being tested in the poll.</p>
                    <p>Rep. Jos. Martin summarized the discussion as showing the need for some
                        fighting statements from the top leaders and for lining up all the
                        individual votes that could possibly be obtained.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded the discussion by inviting the Leaders to call him at

                    <p>Throughout the summer, the Eisenhower administration continued to monitor the
                        progress of fiscal year 1959 Mutual Security legislation and to campaign
                        aggressively to restore funds previously cut by the Congress. Secretary of
                        State <persName>Dulles</persName> commented during a July 1 press conference
                        and President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> also made a
                        statement on the risks of an inadequate Mutual Security program at a press
                        conference the following day. For texts, see <hi rend="italic">American
                            Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1958,</hi> pages 1583–1584. The House
                        of Representatives nonetheless adopted H.R. 13192 that day without restoring
                        the $872 million it had cut from the President’s request. The reductions
                        included cuts in military assistance, defense support, the Development Loan
                        Fund, special assistance, and the President’s Contingency Fund.</p>
                    <p>Action on H.R. 13192 then shifted to the Senate. On July 8, Under Secretary
                        of State Dillon testified before the Appropriations Committee, and
                            <persName>Dulles</persName> testified July 18. Texts of their statements
                        are <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., pages 1597–1603 and 1584–1588,
                        respectively. The White House continued consulting with congressional
                        leaders; Eisenhower informed <persName>Dulles</persName> on the morning of
                        July 16: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        President marked this legislation—along with reciprocal trade and Defense
                        reorganization—as his three prime interests this year. He felt strongly that
                        the country simply cannot continue to throw additional money into things
                        where there is no real need and fail to provide those things that can do a
                        tremendous amount of good. Since the mutual security appropriation was about
                        ready to be marked up in the Senate Committee, he asked every member of the
                        Cabinet to do what he could with his friends on the Hill toward getting the
                        highest possible amount approved by the Senate so that the low House figure
                        could be counteracted for Conference purposes and a reasonably high final
                        appropriation be obtained.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he might be putting out a public statement about this
                        if it could first be determined that the Congressional leaders would not
                        regard such a statement as undercutting them and being a basis for a charge
                        of lobbying that would hurt rather than help the bill.</p>

                        Gen. <persName corresp="#p_PGWB1">Persons</persName> to provide it. Sec.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> requested a briefing

                                cannot be met through the $8,278 million “available for

                                considers that the appropriation of the full $3,518 in the Senate
                                bill is essential if we are adequately to maintain the security
                                position of the free world and support the foreign policy objectives
                                of the United States. This figure will require serious reductions in
                                planned levels of aid; any lesser figure would represent a far more
                                costly gamble with our security and might in the long run amount to
                                greater expenses for the American taxpayer. A compromise between the

                                        million in the President’s request. New requirements already

                                        million would have to be absorbed in the programs of South
                                        Asia and the Far East. With the Communist Chinese moving MIG

                                        foolhardy to reduce our support for those countries which
                                        border on Communist China: Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Yet
                                        these programs will have to be reduced under the $790 figure
                                        of the Senate. Any further reductions would be reckless

                        he felt he needed “every nickel” in the interest of establishing a more

                        further stated that he didn’t like to “coerce” his subcommittee chairman!

                        reported by the Appropriations Committee.</p>
                    <p>Joe Martin then stated emphatically that two-thirds of the Republican House
                        Members will support the full $440 million if it is reported by the

                            >Cannon</persName> indicated that the conference report and/or the
                        statement by the managers will indicate that if the President has to spend
                        money in excess of the amount finally appropriated, he can come back to the
                        Congress for supplemental funds in January. <persName corresp="#p_RS1"

                    <p>I then indicated to <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Cannon</persName> that we had
                        no desire to have him “coerce” <persName corresp="#p_POE1"
                            >Passman</persName>, but would appreciate his “persuasion.” <persName
                            corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> and Martin then said that <persName

                        indeed.</p>
                    <p>Only one sour note was struck during the conference. That occurred when the
                        President suggested that the number of House conferees be increased.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> immediately said that he
                        always appointed the conferees requested by Committee chairmen. The
                        President dropped the subject at once.</p>
                    <p>There was no commitment of any nature on what figure would be agreed to, but
                        Johnson and <persName corresp="#p_KWF1">Knowland</persName> stated that the
                        Senate conferees would hold out for the full $440 million if this amount is
                        voted by the Senate.</p>

                        agreed to the conference report by voice vote August 23, the Senate early
                        August 24. H.R. 13192 thus became P.L. 85–853, the Mutual Security
                        Appropriations Act, 1959, which provided $3.3 billion for the Mutual
                        Security Program in fiscal year 1959. Eisenhower signed P.L. 85–853 on

                    <p>We have discussed on several occasions, in the context of securing necessary
                        Congressional and public support for the Mutual Security Program, the basic
                        problem of achieving a realistic balance between the military and
                        non-military components of that program. We have recognized on the one hand
                        the vital necessity for increasing efforts to meet the economic challenge of
                        the underdeveloped countries and on the other the requirement for continuing
                        military assistance at a level adequate to meet our genuine security
                        needs.</p>

                        unless we are able to justify a military assistance program in forthright
                        and explainable terms, however, we will be faced with increasing pressures
                        for indiscriminate cuts in military assistance funds in the interest of
                        devoting the resulting savings to economic development programs. These
                        pressures will be most difficult to resist without definitive assurances
                        that the programs recommended by the administration are in fact sound and
                        fully justified in the national interest. I am not convinced that we can
                        provide such assurances if we are simply to present a military assistance
                        program to the next Congress in terms fundamentally similar to those used in
                        the past.</p>
                    <p>I believe therefore that before the next Mutual Security Program
                        appropriation is requested of the Congress, it would be desirable that the
                        basic purposes of our military aid, and the standards to be used in fixing
                        its level, be appraised by a public committee of respected and qualified
                        private citizens. The results of that appraisal would be embodied in a
                        public report; its implications might be further elaborated in a classified
                        annex. These results could be taken into account by the Congress in passing
                        on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 program and by the State and
                        Defense staffs in fixing for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 the
                        force goals which underlie levels of military aid.</p>

                        were helpful in securing Congressional acceptance of the Development Loan
                        Fund and the concept of long-term development financing which it implied. I
                        believe that a similar report which concentrated more on our military aid
                        could be similarly helpful in placing this vital aspect of the Mutual
                        Security Program on a sound long-term basis.</p>

                        for giving him the opportunity to serve as chairman of this very important
                        study. The President reiterated his hope that the study would take a good
                        hard look at the whole Military Assistance Program. In particular, he
                        emphasized his own belief that some of the defense forces had been
                        overextended, particularly in underdeveloped countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> asked that all studies and
                        material which might be of help to the Committee be made available to it,
                        and specifically stated his hope that the Joint Chiefs and the <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> would be asked to cooperate fully. The
                        President agreed that this was necessary, and directed me to so inform
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> (accomplished). He indicated
                        that, of course, all agencies would cooperate in every way possible.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> discussed briefly his
                        proposed method of operation including use of the Institute for Defense
                        Analyses, and perhaps other similar organizations, his appointment of Tracy
                        Voorhees as Committee counsel and Colonel <persName corresp="#p_LCGA1"
                            >Lincoln</persName> as a staff coordinator, and mentioned that he hoped
                        James Perkins of Princeton might head up the economic side of the study.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> also indicated that
                        he was going to ask <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Eugene Black</persName> of
                        the World Bank and Sam Waugh of the Export-Import Bank to help informally.
                        The President indicated no objection to any of these arrangements.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> informed the President
                        that he had already met with Senators <persName corresp="#p_FJW1"
                            >Fulbright</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                            >Mansfield</persName>, both of whom seemed favorably impressed by the
                        membership of the Committee, and he asked if the President would have any
                        objection if, within appropriate bounds, Congressional leaders on both sides
                        of the aisle were kept informed of the Committee’s progress. The President
                        indicated agreement.</p>
                    <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0464"/>
                    <p>I told the President that some of the other leaders who had been informed of
                        the pending appointment of the Committee were concerned that there was no
                        member representing a “conservative” point of view, and told him of my
                        invitation to Herbert Hoover, Jr.,<note n="2" xml:id="d227fn2">Former Under
                            Secretary of State.</note> to participate with the Committee. The
                        President indicated that he would be willing to urge Mr.
                            <persName>Hoover</persName> to accept. He also agreed that if Mr.
                            <persName>Hoover</persName> cannot accept, Mr.
                            <persName>Joseph</persName> Dodge should be invited to participate.</p>
                    <p>In talking about the relationship between this study and the President’s
                        Mutual Security message, the President suggested that either the Budget
                        message or the State of the Union message make reference to the Committee
                        and indicate that the findings of the Committee would be available to the
                        Congress before the end of the next session. He suggested that to the extent
                        feasible conclusions of the Committee be discussed with the appropriate
                        Departments as the study goes along so that acceptable conclusions could be
                        worked into the Mutual Security message. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> informed the President that he had
                        already established contact with Doug Dillon and Jack Irwin of Defense with
                        this in mind.</p>

                    <p>The Budget Director explained to the President that budget allowances for
                        most of the agencies had now been worked out, and that the matter of a
                        balanced budget hinged upon figures still to be determined for the
                        Department of Defense and the Mutual Security Program. He stated that while
                        he had originally urged, and still believed, that the Defense budget should
                        not exceed $40 billion, there was still room for balancing the budget if
                        Defense were allowed as much as $40.8 billion in expenditures, and if the
                        Mutual Security expenditures were limited to $3.5 billion.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated his strong desire for a balanced budget. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> reviewed the various
                        reasons in support of so doing, including particularly the need of
                        preserving the integrity of the dollar. The President indicated that he
                        would go along with the $3.5 billion figure for Mutual Security and
                        suggested that the cut be made principally from the Military Assistance
                        Program. He also supported the effort to resolve the Defense budget at $40.8
                        billion, and directed General <persName corresp="#p_PGWB1"

                    <p>The Special Assistant to the President explained the background of the
                        written report by the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the reference subject
                        reminding the Council that last May it had asked for a report from the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff on the kind of force posture (missions, major force levels,
                        and major types of armament by service) which the Chiefs thought would be
                        desirable as of June 30, 1962, for those nations receiving the major part of
                        our military assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> also
                        noted certain facts of particular interest which the Planning Board had
                        discussed when the Joint Chiefs of Staff report had been considered. He then
                        suggested that unless Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1"
                            >McElroy</persName> or General Twining had some comment to make on the
                        report that the Council, in view of the heavy agenda to follow, merely note
                        the report. (A copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s

                            >General Nathan F. Twining, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>,
                            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</note> said he would like at this
                        time to explain the procedures by which the Joint Chiefs of Staff currently
                        formulated force levels in connection with the military assistance program
                        because the difficulty apparently lies not so much in the process itself but
                        in a general lack of understanding of how it works. Forthwith General
                        Twining read a statement on the subject, a copy of which is filed in the
                        Minutes of the Meeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d230fn4">Not printed. (Eisenhower
                            Library, Special Assistant for National Security Affairs Records,

                        chief objective in General Twining’s statement was to emphasize that in the
                        latter part of the process political and economic factors, for example the
                        capability of the economy of the country to which military assistance is
                        provided by the U.S. <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0467"/>to support the
                        force levels determined to be desirable by the U.S., have to be considered.
                        He also stressed the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that when U.S.
                        military assistance is used primarily for a political purpose in a foreign
                        nation rather than for strictly military purposes, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        desire this fact to be clearly identified both in discussions in the
                        National Security Council and in the discussions of the military assistance
                        program in the U.S. Congress.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that further
                        discussions of this subject were scheduled between officers of the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff and officers of Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName>’s office in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName>’s capacity as Coordinator of the Mutual Security
                        Program. The subject would also be treated, he was sure, by the President’s
                        newly appointed committee headed by General <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1"
                            >Draper</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d230fn5">See <ref target="#d228"

                    <p>The President pointed out that it was very difficult indeed to distinguish
                        between political and military reasons for providing U.S. military
                        assistance to friendly foreign powers. In essence, continued the President,
                        military assistance was merely a tool of U.S political or national security
                        policy. General Twining stated that he agreed generally with the President’s
                        view but that there were instances such as Ethiopia where our military
                        assistance could be clearly distinguished as given for purely political
                        reasons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> commented that the subject of
                        the discussion was one of the issues singled out by the <gloss

                        National Security Council. He then read the statement of the issue from the
                        Planning Board paper together with the comment of the Planning Board which
                        reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The U.S. should concentrate military aid programs on military
                                objectives on a priority basis, using, wherever feasible, other
                                means to accomplish political objectives. Where in exceptional cases
                                national security objectives necessitate providing military
                                assistance for primarily political purposes, the U.S. should provide
                                that kind of military assistance which would be most useful
                                militarily and least detrimental economically while still being
                                consistent with our political purposes.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> had concluded his
                        statement, the President reverted to General Twining’s observation about
                        Ethiopia as an example of military assistance given for purely political
                        purposes. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] He
                        was, however, concerned about Ethiopia as a part of Africa. If we were to
                        lose Ethiopia, this might well be the beginning of a process by which we
                        might ultimately lose large parts of the rest of Africa. Accordingly, he
                        repeated that the differentiation <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0468"
                        />between giving aid for military and political purposes was very hard to
                        make and constituted a distinction without a difference so far as the
                        general problem of U.S. national security was concerned. He added that he
                        did not actually object to making the distinction as General Twining
                        proposed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented that from
                        the point of view of his people, it was better to play down the distinction
                        between military assistance given for political and for military purposes
                        especially when it came to dealing with the U.S. Congress. The President
                        indicated that he was well aware of the fact that many members of Congress
                        regarded U.S. assistance to foreign nations, given for political or economic
                        reasons, to be simply “a give-away”. It was far from a give-away. Such
                        assistance made a vital contribution to the overall national security of the
                        U.S., however difficult it was to make Congress understand this fact.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> expressed agreement
                        with the views of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        and went on to say that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were not making any strong
                        recommendation in favor of a distinction between aid given for political as
                        opposed to military assistance, except insofar as it concerned the officials
                        around this table.</p>
                    <p>The President advised all concerned that when they went to Congress to get
                        appropriations for military assistance for political purposes or to get
                        economic assistance, they should simply describe all such assistance as
                        national security assistance.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President expressed his agreement with this suggestion and added his
                        conviction that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s
                        point was very wisely taken. As far as possible in dealing with Congress
                        political assistance to foreign nations should be tied into military
                        assistance. Congress was as generous in providing funds for military
                        assistance as it was niggardly in providing funds for assistance for
                        political purposes.</p>

                    <p>When the formal presentations were concluded, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                            >Gray</persName> directed the Council’s attention to the statements of
                        the seven most important issues which the Planning Board believed desirable
                        for the Council to discuss in the light of these presentations. The first
                        issue, he pointed out, concerned the level of military aid deliveries. Using
                        a chart which indicated the decline of carry-over funds for military
                        assistance, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that
                        while there had been good program management to have reduced the huge
                        carry-over which existed in 1953, the reduction can no longer continue. For
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 the Congress had voted 1.5
                        billion in new appropriations; we are actually spending about 2.4 billion.
                        Accordingly, we have come to the point where we must either fail to meet
                        approved program requirements or obtain an increase in the annual funds from
                        the Congress. In presenting this issue Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                            >Gray</persName> emphasized that he was not suggesting that the Council
                        reach a decision today but was merely warning that our former flexibility in
                        our military assistance program is about over.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> confirmed Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s warning by indicating that
                        the minimum lead time we now have in military assistance deliveries is down
                        to about a year. Accordingly, we were about at the end of the road unless we
                        proceeded to reduce deliveries under the Military Assistance Program.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that the Joint Chiefs of Staff have reached the point
                        where they are simply going to have to decide whether another new missile
                        program or another aircraft program was or was not more important than
                        provision of financial support for our Military Assistance Program. This
                        would be unquestionably a hard decision involving among other things a
                        terrible domestic political problem because of the fact that our politicians
                        do not like to see us spend money for these assistance programs. The
                        President said that, compared to some of the less essential U.S. military
                        programs, the Military Assistance Program represented a better investment of
                        funds for our national security. To illustrate his point of view, the
                        President then cited the case of Pakistan. Here was a nation divided into
                        two geographical parts by India and a nation which was weak from the
                        military, political and economic point of view. Military assistance to
                        Pakistan in the President’s view was of very doubtful value beyond the
                        provision of such assistance as would be required to cope with local
                        security for Pakistan. What Pakistan really needed was more economic
                        assistance. To make matters worse the fact that we provide military
                        assistance to Pakistan scares India to death. The President indicated that
                        he wished the Joint Chiefs of Staff to look carefully into the problem of
                        providing military assistance for Pakistan. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that this subject was
                        already being carefully considered and the President accordingly dropped his
                        request on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                    <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0471"/>
                    <p>The President then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">James
                            Smith</persName> the number of employees in his International
                        Cooperation Administration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1"
                            >Smith</persName> replied that the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                        had about 10,000 people overseas. The President then asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> how many employees there were in
                        this country. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> said he
                        could not provide this figure at the moment.</p>
                    <p>The President then observed that in all our discussions of the problem of
                        underdeveloped countries and the kind of assistance which we could
                        effectively provide them, we had not faced up to what was really the most
                        serious problem, namely, that of exploding population growths. As far as he
                        could see, continued the President, the only solution to this problem
                        throughout the world was finding an effective two cent contraceptive.
                        Otherwise no matter what we do, as these reports indicate, we keep falling
                        behind in our efforts to raise the standard of living in so many parts of
                        the world where it is desperately low. In connection with his argument the
                        President cited Germaine Tillion’s recently published volume on Algeria.
                        Indeed an explosive increase in population could be predicted for our own
                        country as well as for the less developed areas of the world.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> observed that when he
                        had been at the Colombo Plan meeting<note n="11" xml:id="d230fn11"><persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> was Deputy Chairman of the U.S.
                            Delegation to the Ministerial Meeting of the Consultative Committee on
                            Cooperative Economic Development in South and Southeast Asia (Colombo
                            Plan), held in Seattle, Washington, November 10–13.</note> he had had a
                        discussion with a high Indian official in the United Nations economic and
                        social organization. The Indian official informed <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> that he had been preparing a report
                        on the problem of exploding population rates and was at least himself an
                        ardent believer in the necessity of the widespread use of contraceptives if
                        the problem of over-population was ever to be solved. The President added
                        that certainly something drastic had to be done to solve this problem. He
                        certainly did not know how to get started on this solution and he
                        furthermore could not himself get it started. If there were any ideas on how
                        to deal with the problem, they should certainly be brought to this
                        table.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President remarked that when the new <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1"
                            >Draper</persName> Committee begins its study of foreign assistance it
                        would be essential to tackle the basic problem of whether U.S. policy is
                        actually running against the tide of affairs in the world. It was a genuine
                        question whether or not the U.S. could continue to try to promote democracy
                        and free enterprise, in the forms we understand these systems, in the
                        underdeveloped countries. It comes down essentially to this: we may have to
                        reconsider whether or not we must not learn to go along and play ball with
                        political and economic institutions in these underdeveloped <pb n="440"
                            xml:id="pg_440" facs="0472"/>countries which resemble less the kind of
                        system that works in the U.S. but rather systems which are moving in the
                        direction of nationalized economies.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that whenever he and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> got together and had an opportunity
                        to philosophize, they always came back to the fundamental question, namely,
                        whether free government in this world is going to be able in the future to
                        hold out against ruthless dictatorships. That, said the President, was our
                        basic problem. The Vice President returned to his point and cited Sukarno’s
                        guided democracy as constituting a concrete illustration of what he had
                        meant in his remark about the U.S. running against the tide in many of the
                        less developed areas of the world.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then warned the
                        Council that in the next session of the Congress this is what we were going
                        to have to be talking about in terms of increasing <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1959 or <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 financial
                        commitments of the U.S. in the various categories of foreign assistance. As
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> outlined these
                        commitments they reached a magnitude of some ten billion dollars. In
                        concluding Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        expressed his great anxiety about the effect of such commitments on the
                        problem of the flow of dollars from the U.S. abroad which was already in his
                        view serious enough. The Director of the Budget added to the commitments
                        outlined by the Secretary of the Treasury items concerning the Export-Import
                        Bank and PL–480. In Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName>’ view
                        this brought the total up to some eleven billion dollars in a single year.
                        Were we not thus trying, asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                            >Stans</persName>, to fill a completely bottomless pit?</p>
                    <p>The President observed that there was at least some hopeful evidence that
                        some of our more prosperous allied countries are beginning to move in to
                        help us in dealing with the problem of meeting the aspirations of the
                        underdeveloped countries. Moreover, said the President, in considering such
                        matters he always came back to the problem that if we do not ourselves
                        provide for assistance to underdeveloped countries, what conceivable
                        alternative is there which provides any hope of solution? In other words,
                        said the President, this problem was not only a dollar problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> intervened at this point to
                        indicate that the problem which the Council had just been discussing was in
                        fact the 7th issue which the Planning Board had believed the Council should
                        discuss. This issue, continued Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                            >Gray</persName>, concerned the relationship between mutual security and
                        the U.S. contribution to international organizations. What offsets, if any,
                        should be made in the Mutual Security Program in view of the planned
                        increase in the U.S. quotas for the International Bank for Reconstruction
                        and Development and the International Monetary Fund, proposed U.S.
                        contributions to new multilateral organizations, and a potential
                        contribution to the International <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0473"
                        />Development Association. It had been the view of the Planning Board that
                        maximum offsets should be made in the Mutual Security Program consistent
                        with U.S. policy objectives.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented that in
                        administering the Mutual Security Program we have already agreed among
                        ourselves that this recommendation should be followed as far as possible.
                        Unhappily experience indicated that you could not always reduce the size of
                        the Mutual Security Program through resort to these offsets.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then raised the second issue
                        which the Planning Board thought the Council should discuss and which
                        concerned the inadequacies of the current flow of capital to achieve
                        economic development objectives overseas. After reading the alternatives
                        which it seemed to the Planning Board were open to the U.S., Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> emphasized the extreme difficulties
                        involved in either alternative, that of continuing the effort to achieve the
                        desired economic development in underdeveloped countries even though the
                        task seemed hopeless in the light of experience or else recognizing that the
                        achievement of all these objectives everywhere is unrealistic and
                        re-examining our aid program with a view to concentrating on selected
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>The President, reacting to the pessimistic views which had been expressed,
                        observed that perhaps it would be more realistic to put up the white flag
                        now to judge from the way that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                            >Gray</persName> and members of the National Security Council had been
                        talking here today. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> replied
                        by stating that he still felt that the objectives of National Security
                        Council policy for economic development in the underdeveloped countries of
                        the Free World were too broad. Perhaps concentrating on a selective basis
                        would provide an answer.</p>
                    <p>The President was clearly not impressed by this argument and said that the
                        question of selectivity was not relevant. After all, continued the
                        President, we had been studying this problem of foreign aid for years. As
                        the President saw it, if we were to single out one or two countries in a
                        given area for continued assistance and abandon our programs for all the
                        other countries in that area, then the country or countries which we have
                        actually selected will ultimately be out-flanked and overwhelmed by the
                        forces opposed to the U.S. It was the Soviets who, because they were on the
                        offensive, were in the perfect position to make use of a policy of
                        selectivity in their assistance programs. So again we face the problem of
                        how to deal with the issue of exploding populations world-wide. Equally
                        important with a practical solution of this problem was the necessity that
                        the United States provide moral and spiritual support and moral and
                        spiritual power in these countries. What was really essential to a solution
                        of this problem was a spiritual Renaissance in the whole western world.</p>
                    <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0474"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> added that we must
                        also teach the underdeveloped peoples all around the world that if they
                        wanted to raise their standards of living they must make up their minds that
                        they could not do it overnight in one long leap. The process of raising
                        standards must go on slowly and methodically and within the human capacities
                        of the peoples of these underdeveloped countries. There was no sense in
                        providing them with plants and installations which they could boast produced
                        more of this or more of that than any other similar plant in the world if it
                        was beyond their capacities effectively to run such an industrial plant or
                        dam or other installation. In reply to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName>, the President asked the question whether the
                        Soviet emissary in one of these underdeveloped countries was not certain to
                        point out to the people of that country what enormous strides the U.S.S.R.
                        had made in the course of some forty years. The achievements of the Soviet
                        Union obviously have a tremendous appeal for the underdeveloped peoples.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said it was some
                        comfort to note a considerable degree of skepticism in India of the great
                        strides towards industrialization now being made by Communist China at such
                        terrible cost to human values which the Indians cherished. The President
                        observed that the statistics seemed to suggest that this all was an
                        impossible problem to solve unless we can do something to change human
                        nature and human habits. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName>
                        informed the President that the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was
                        presently attempting to grapple with the problem of over-population in so
                        many parts of the world.</p>
                    <p>The time set for the end of the meeting was now approaching and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> asked the President if he could at
                        least briefly outline the remaining three issues which the Planning Board
                        had singled out as worthy of Council discussion. The first of these was the
                        4th issue concerning the nature of future U.S. military assistance to <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Was the need to achieve the <gloss
                            target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70 force goals regarded by us as so
                        compelling that we should give all feasible support to their achievement
                        even if this means reducing military assistance programs in other parts of
                        the world? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName>
                        commented at some length, with respect to this issue, on the fact that the
                        U.S. alone could not be expected to carry additional burdens in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> while other <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> countries were tending to reduce their own contributions.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> made the added point
                        that up until the present the U.S. has not had a very clear and precise idea
                        of the total cost of meeting the <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70 goals.
                        The first step was therefore to clarify this cost.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, noting that the 5th issue had
                        already been discussed in the Council in connection with the Council’s
                        discussion of the first item on the agenda, briefly set forth the final
                        issue raised by the Planning Board, namely, the relationship between
                        military assistance and the overseas internal security programs. Was it
                        realistic to expect <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0475"/>that the
                        overseas internal security program (<gloss target="#t_OISP1">OISP</gloss>)
                        would permit any substantial reduction in military assistance funds in the
                        foreseeable future? In any event, were the merits of <gloss
                            target="#t_OISP1">OISP</gloss> on its own sufficient to justify
                        continuation of present types of programs, including provision of equipment
                        where appropriate?</p>
                    <p>In further comment Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> suggested
                        that the Council request a review of the <gloss target="#t_OISP1"
                            >OISP</gloss> program by the Operations Coordinating Board reporting the
                        appropriate portions of such a review to the National Security Council. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s recommendation was
                        accepted.</p>
                    <p>The President closed the meeting with the remark “Well, is there any bright
                        news around here?”</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mutual Security</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> first noted indications in recent months of a
                        toughening of communist attitude in the Middle East, Quemoy, and Berlin
                        which he regarded as a testing of the free world’s will to resist. He also
                        noted the intensification of communist activity in world markets, making
                        specific reference to the recent action on aluminum and tin.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> believed that to meet this
                        competition there was needed a greater cooperative effort from the free
                        world, not just the United States. He noted that West Germany and Britain
                        are stepping up their efforts.</p>
                    <p>He referred again to the increased authorizations needed for the
                        International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then presented in some
                        detail the specific mutual security program, pointing out that 65 countries
                        were included of which 31 would receive both military and economic aid, 23
                        would receive economic aid only, and 11 would receive military aid only. The
                        request for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 60 would be $3.93 billion as
                        compared to $3.95 billion requested in 1959 and $3.3 billion appropriated.
                        After going over the seven categories of programs, he pointed out that the
                        pipeline had been reduced from $8.5 billion in 1953 to $2.6 billion in 1959,
                        and it would stand at $2.3 billion at the end of 1960. Beyond this he
                        thought it could not be reduced without affecting deliveries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stressed that the
                        Development Loan Fund would all be committed by January, that more than $1.5
                        billion worth of applications were still under consideration, hence it would
                        be necessary to ask for an additional $225 million for operations in the
                        remainder of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59. He said it was hoped that
                        operations under the Fund would be continued into the future at a level of
                        about $700 million per year.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> about
                        the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views on the mutual security
                        program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said they regard
                        it as a very essential part of the over-all defense effort. He thought the
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would prefer, if reductions were
                        necessary anywhere to cut certain domestic programs than to cut our military
                        assistance program. The President noted the current studies of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> Committee.</p>
                    <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0477"/>
                    <p>Sens. <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> hoped that Department officials
                        would set up a bookkeeping account to cover items committed but not
                        technically obligated so as to overcome the inevitable criticism from Rep.
                            <persName corresp="#p_POE1">Passman</persName>. Sen. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName> hoped that the mutual security
                        message might be sent to Congress earlier this year, even earlier than
                        March. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought this not
                        possible. The President remarked that Congress always seemed to hold this
                        program anyway until the end of the session, perhaps to use it for
                        bargaining power even though it was part of our national security.</p>

                    <p>In any approach on the Hill in respect to changing the Connally Reservation,
                        the paramount importance of our other programs, including Mutual Security,
                        in this Session ought to be kept uppermost in mind.</p>
                    <p>A lot of the same people or same thinking which went into the Connally
                        Reservation are still present, or extant, in the Senate and John Bricker has
                        only just gone. It would seem unfortunate to stir things up if they would
                        hurt the current program.</p>
                    <p>For that reason (and I am sure Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> would agree with this), almost exquisite care should
                        be taken as to (a) who is approached first and how the approach is made; and
                        (b) such approach should be closely coordinated with <persName

                        stressed the importance of softening the views of a few key members of

                    <p>The President spoke repeatedly and at length on the importance of the mutual
                        security program as the most efficient money that we spend and he called
                        attention to the indications that the United States is pricing itself out of
                        the foreign market and the ensuing requirement for the United States to be
                        concerned with the economic growth of countries that are buyers of <gloss

                    <p>Rep. Arends thought it would be helpful to use the case of Turkey, with facts
                        and figures, to illustrate the value of the program.</p>
                    <p>Considerable attention was given to the matter of timing of the
                        Administration effort to thwart the professed intention of Democrats to
                        compensate for increased spending on domestic programs by reducing the
                        mutual security appropriation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                            >Halleck</persName> concluded that Rep. <persName corresp="#p_POE1"

                        House if it were clear that the country as a whole was soundly convinced of
                        the need for mutual security programs.</p>

                    <p>He commented that the group had found that some of the criticisms of the
                        program are justified. There have been long delays, and programming has been
                        slow on many occasions. They feel that the errors in execution are of some
                        importance, but stress that they are <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0480"
                        />quite incidental and minor in relation to the value of the program. The
                        President said that it is frustrating to him that after six years of
                        constant effort we still can’t get the degree of efficiency we wish.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> next commented that the
                        group is thinking in terms of clear recognition and acceptance that this is
                        a long-term program. He pointed out that as long as it is kept on a
                        short-term basis we will not get the best people to man it.</p>
                    <p>At Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName>’s request Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCJ1">McCloy</persName> next spoke about the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area. He said that this area is so
                        potentially strong that any idea of not building up its strength would be
                        both fantastic and foolish. There is a need to modernize the weapons of the
                        forces in the area. These weapons in almost every case have quite long lead
                        times. General McNarney said he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJ1"
                            >McCloy</persName> had gone carefully into the strategy in the area and
                        he concurred that there is a great lack of modern weapons such as the Honest
                        John, the Sergeant and the Mace which have great value in deterring the
                        Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what impression the group had gotten of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> thinking on the problem of authorizing
                        the use of atomic weapons in the event of attack. He also mentioned a
                        Chamber of Commerce survey which concluded by proposing to save money for
                        the United States by cutting mutual security. He added that the argument
                        that there has been excessive carry-over has been used to defeat the program
                        in the past.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJ1">McCloy</persName> said there is much that is
                        ominous in French attitudes.<note n="4" xml:id="d235fn4">The French
                            Government had decided to withdraw its fleet from the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Mediterranean Command.</note> The
                        President agreed, commenting that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
                            Gaulle</persName> tends to take a tough attitude towards the Soviets
                        while withdrawing his own forces and using them as he wishes—thus being firm
                        with other people’s troops. The President said he has always thought that we
                        should be ready to have the French fleet put on the same basis as the U.S.
                        and U.K. As for himself, he would have gone further and would have put the
                        U.S. and U.K. fleets completely under <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                        >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the final report of the group, the President asked if they
                        would have to go back for more material or whether their remaining task is
                        chiefly one of analysis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName>
                        said it is a problem of analysis, study of the legislation, etc.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Development Loan Fund, the President recalled that we have
                        studied the matter carefully and felt that we should have about $600 million
                        a year or so. It has been terribly hard going to get anything like adequate
                        funds to make this program effective.</p>
                    <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0481"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> next assured the President
                        that the group is ready to help in any way it can. The President was very
                        grateful for this comment and said that action by the group would be a very
                        fine thing. Our people know the members of this group and have confidence in
                        them. The members have investigated the situation themselves. He asked them
                        to organize what they thought they could do and let him know what they
                        thought the Administration could do. The President recalled an incident
                        which he called “the conversion of <persName corresp="#p_HG2">George
                            Humphrey</persName>,” who was a strong opponent of the program
                        initially. The President said on several occasions he would lay out the
                        problem to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> and ask what
                        he would do. Invariably Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>
                        would come to accept the program but always on an intellectual basis, still
                        saying that while he would do it he wouldn’t like it.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Any cuts Congress may make in this year’s Mutual Security Program would pose
                        considerably greater risks than has been the case in the past. This is so
                        because of an increase in economic needs throughout the world as compared
                        with last year and because of the decrease in the Military Assistance
                        pipeline and the austerity of the figure requested for Military Assistance.
                        A careful study indicates that if Congress should reduce the Program below
                        the level of $3.75 billion we may well face serious dangers to our security
                        position throughout the world. (See attachment for breakdown of $3.75
                        billion figure.)<note n="1" xml:id="d236fn1">Not printed.</note></p>
                    <p>Last year Congress voted $3.3 billion for Mutual Security as against a
                        request for $3.94 billion. It is now reasonable to expect last year’s
                        appropriation will be raised by some $100 to $150 million, as a <pb n="450"
                            xml:id="pg_450" facs="0482"/>result of the $225 million deficiency
                        request for the Development Loan Fund now before Congress. This, if
                        approved, will give us a total of something over $3.4 billion for Mutual
                        Security in the fiscal year 1959. This figure has proved to be an absolute
                        minimum and its austerity has been the cause of considerable difficulty in
                        administering the Program. So low a figure would definitely be inadequate
                        for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960.</p>
                    <p>A careful check of Congressional opinion indicates that opposition to the
                        Program at present is more widespread and vigorous than at any time in the
                        past. This is so because in addition to those who have traditionally opposed
                        the Program, a number of other members of Congress favor large cuts this
                        year for purely domestic, political reasons having to do with such things as
                        the overall Administration position on domestic spending programs of the
                        welfare type and the decision to undertake no new public works starts this
                        year.</p>
                    <p>As a result, in the absence of extraordinary and sustained high-level
                        efforts, and in the absence of some world crisis of frightening proportions,
                        we can expect that this year’s Mutual Security appropriation will be cut to
                        a figure of around $3 billion, or even less. The effects of such a cut would
                        be grave indeed. Since so much of the opposition this year is domestic in
                        character and does not appear to be responsive to persuasion by the
                        Department of State, it is becoming clear that a strong and sustained effort
                        led by the White House along the lines of your recent persuasive efforts and
                        having all-out support from all elements of the Administration as well as
                        from civilian groups will be necessary if the Program is to be kept
                        relatively intact. May Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and
                        I have the opportunity to discuss the outlook with you, General <persName

                    <p>In April, the Department of State released a report on the impact of the
                        Mutual Security Program on the U.S. economy. Done in accord with Section
                        413(c) of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended by the Mutual Security
                        Act of 1958, the report was prepared by an inter-agency group comprising
                        representatives from the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense,
                        Interior, Labor, and State, the International Cooperation Administration,
                        and the Development Loan Fund. It concluded the Mutual Security Program had
                        relieved the U.S. economy of an additional defense burden by increasing
                        allies’ defense postures; promoted and protected the economy’s interest by
                        furthering U.S. foreign policy objectives; and provided expanding
                        opportunities and markets for U.S. business by furthering economic growth in
                        the less-developed countries. See <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:

                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> presented the preliminary findings
                        of the <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> Committee as
                        recommending an additional $400 million, mostly for the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military support program. After reviewing
                        this, State Department agreed that $400 million is approximately in order,
                        especially since the original submission to Congress was held at a minimum
                        pending the Committee study. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> stated that the Administration thought it best to
                        transmit the report to Congress without asking for additional funds at this
                        time since the contingency fund can cover any immediate requirements, and a
                        further request can be made next session should that be necessary.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented on the high
                        qualifications of the members of the Committee and on the further work they
                        would do to stimulate a public committee supporting the mutual security
                        program.</p>
                    <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0484"/>
                    <p>The President characterized the report as very objective, then went on to
                        speak of the problem that would develop in the public mind as regards
                        authorization and expenditures. The President wanted it understood that very
                        little was needed at the moment for expenditures and that there was no hurry
                        about obtaining the desired authorization.</p>
                    <p>The President then stressed the importance of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> concept to defense of the North Atlantic area and his own
                        willingness to give up an eminently desirable position at Columbia because
                        of his belief in this concept. He noted that he had not yet seen any
                        evaluation of the ability of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations
                        to make an increase in their own efforts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                            >Quarles</persName> heartily confirmed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName>’s comments on the merits of the preliminary findings,
                        which he could substantiate from his own travels around Europe.
                        Modernization of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces is clearly
                        needed, and the United States must provide the modern weapons even though
                        the other nations intensify their own efforts. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss>, he said, strongly supported the conclusion that the
                        military program should continue to be maintained at the expenditure level
                        of about $2.2 billion, whereas the pending <gloss target="#t_NOA1"
                            >NOA</gloss> request stands at $1.6 billion.</p>
                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> thought that political
                        advantage lay on the side of vigorous assertion of the case for mutual
                        security. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Halleck</persName> thought the
                        report would be extremely valuable in the effort to get the actual
                        appropriation increased nearly to what the Administration had requested. He
                        concurred in the desirability of postponing any requests for additional
                        authorization specifically in connection with the <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> Committee report. Sen. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName> hoped that the Administration
                        would not now forecast the possibility of a supplemental request next year.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that any
                        supplemental next year could only serve to make up the difference between
                        the Administration’s original request and whatever Congress authorizes this
                        year, since it should not be expected that Congress would put through new
                        basic legislation (which an authorization bill is for this program) on a
                        supplemental basis.</p>
                    <p>The President again emphasized the worth of the report. He stated the
                        dependence of the nation’s security in the long run on a balanced budget. He
                        commented ironically on the demagoguery involved in requests for additional
                        appropriations for the Department of Defense by people who argue against the
                        mutual security program. He continued to believe that a reduction of $1/2
                        billion in mutual security could require up to $15 billion additional in
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> funds. He repeated his desire to see
                        a more careful analysis of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and French
                        capability, since they can accomplish many things in their own countries at
                        much less expense than can we. He noted that he would himself talk with
                        General <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> before any definite
                        action is taken.</p>

                    <p>The President said he had asked to talk with the group as a means of
                        assisting him in making up his mind in just what way to act on the
                        recommendations of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName>’s
                        committee. He commented that what is principally lacking in his mind at the
                        present moment is an assessment of whether the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> countries, on their side, are doing enough to advance the
                        modernization of their forces. He recalled also the criticism of waste in
                        the administration of the program that has been made, and said that Defense
                        is looking into all possible ways to tighten up and streamline the program.
                        In addition, he noted that the report indicates that the carrying out of its
                        recommendations would not involve substantially increased expenditures in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName>’s

                            1269–1301.</note> the President said he saw no reason why the Mutual
                        Security story cannot be told in just the way it was submitted to him in the
                        report of the Committee. He added that he wants to send the report down to
                        the Congress today or tomorrow with a letter which is not inconsistent with
                        the recommendations of the report.</p>
                    <p>The President said he is very mindful of the necessity to maintain the
                        soundness of the American dollar, and referred to reports made to him by
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> on his return from
                        New Delhi some months ago.<note n="3" xml:id="d239fn3">Not found.</note>
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had told him that
                        more than twenty of the national representatives in New Delhi for the World
                        Bank meeting said that the most critical element in the whole world economic
                            <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0486"/>picture is the soundness of the
                        American dollar. The President said that he has the responsibility of
                        keeping demagogues from attacking his whole budgetary effort, as well as
                        this program, on the basis that, in submitting the new recommendations he
                        was unbalancing the budget. He said he would, of course, stress that this is
                        not correct and that expenditures under the recommended increase will not
                        come until fiscal year 1961.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> said his group felt that
                        if the Administration doesn’t ask for the $400 million increase his group
                        has recommended, the Congress will cut the program much more than would
                        otherwise be the case. He said that in the view of his Committee a “four
                        square” acceptance of the recommendations of the Committee by the President
                        could have real effect in strengthening Western European resolve at the time
                        of the forthcoming negotiations. On the other hand, not to come out four
                        square and ask for the additional appropriations will look fuzzy and will
                        damage the program, in his judgment. He assured the President of the support
                        of the Committee nevertheless. He commented that the program is in
                        difficulty. There is a strong drive under way in the Chamber of Commerce to
                        have that body come out against the program in its meeting next week. He
                        reiterated his fear that failure to recommend the additional appropriations
                        now will weaken the whole program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJ1">McCloy</persName>, at Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName>’s request, spoke next. Regarding
                        the President’s point on the adequacy of the Europeans’ own contribution, he
                        agreed that there is much in this. These countries are gaining substantially
                        in economic strength. At the same time only the United States is in position
                        to provide, technologically, the newest types of weapons. There is a feeling
                        in Europe that they are on the verge of having a real deterrent force of
                        their own, rather than a “trip wire” type of force which is inadequate to
                        give real confidence.</p>
                    <p>The President recalled that when he went to Europe he exerted himself to have
                        U.S. troops brought over on an emergency basis while the Europeans formed
                        their own forces. Now the British have cut their forces on the Continent to
                        a fraction of what they were; the Belgians have cut down on their training
                        period; the French have removed the bulk of their forces from Europe to
                        North Africa. He felt that there should be some stimulation of mutual effort
                        on their part. Instead we are the only ones who have kept up our strength
                        there. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> suggested that the
                        President include in his message a passage to the effect that now is the
                        time for the Europeans to make a greater contribution. The President
                        indicated some sympathy with this suggestion. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> also suggested that the President
                        stress the difference between appropriations and expenditures in order to
                        preclude charges that he has upset his own budget. The President said he had
                        in mind to point out that the added expenditures would be very small in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0487"/>1960 but that it is hard to put
                        across the difference between appropriations and expenditures, even if he
                        “read a lesson to the Congress” in the letter to them.</p>
                    <p>In concluding the President said he agreed with the conclusions of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> Committee. He is somewhat
                        uncertain on the best way to act on them, since he noted that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> seemed to think it would weaken the
                        program not to submit a recommendation for the full additional
                        appropriations now. He said he would give further thought to this
                        matter.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that he had
                        talked to Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee. They are
                        opposed to an increase in the gas tax (or in any tax, for that matter). If
                        funds are insufficient they say the road program should be cut back.
                        However, he doesn’t feel they would stand with this position when the
                        pressure builds up.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said the picture on taxes
                        is that it looks as though receipts will run somewhat higher than estimated.
                        But outlays will run higher also—he mentioned that interest payments will
                        exceed estimates. Regarding the recommendations of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> Committee, he would like to see
                        re-programming efforts carried out to cover $250-300 million of the $400
                        million recommended by the <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName>
                        Group.</p>
                    <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0488"/>
                    <p>The President recalled that the Committee had thought that not much of their
                        recommended addition would actually be expended in fiscal 1960. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that this is a
                        distinction that it is impossible to get across to the public, who would be
                        told by members of Congress that the President had broken his own
                        budget.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said there seemed to be only
                        two approaches to accommodating the recommendations within budgetary limits.
                        The first is to say to Defense that they should add some $250 million to the
                        aid program, taking it out of Defense proposals, particularly those which
                        seem to be in difficulty on the Hill such as the proposed carrier. The
                        second is to reprogram within Defense and the Mutual Security Program so as
                        to bring together sufficient assets to carry out the <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> Committee recommendations. The
                        figures recommended come to $345 million for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>
                        has agreed that it would be possible to take out some $45 million of
                        this.</p>
                    <p>The President said that what the Committee has brought out is that what the
                        Administration asked for this year is $400-$500 million too little to keep
                        the program going at the rather constant level that is required to maintain
                        world security. They do not believe we would ever go back up in total
                        program funds once the program has been dropped to this lower level. The
                        result would be a let-down all around the world.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said that there are
                        possibilities in the field of excess determinations and declarations which
                        might help this program very greatly. Defense maintains an “economic
                        retention inventory” aggregating nearly $5 billion of items stored for
                        possible future need, but not in use by the services. A hard look at this
                        inventory should make available very sizeable proceeds.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName>
                        Committee by its action has put him into a position where he does not know
                        what to do. He thought that if we could find ways of reprogramming we could
                        advise the Congress that we are meeting the <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1"
                            >Draper</persName> recommendations through extraordinary measures but
                        that next year the program level will have to go up. He felt that those
                        chiefly concerned in the program must reach agreement on some money figure
                        as to net needs, if any, in additional funds to carry out the <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> proposals. He thought that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> must be made a party to
                        this determination. The President said he felt he is committed to this group
                        of men, who are very fine men who have given up a great deal of their own
                        time in order to make this study for him. He asked me to arrange to get Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> in with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> to arrive at a figure.</p>
                    <p>Following the meeting with the President, my discussion with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> disclosed that there were differing
                        interpretations of what the President had asked. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> felt that the President had said that the <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> recommendations <pb n="457"
                            xml:id="pg_457" facs="0489"/>should be carried out through reprogramming
                        this year and through a statement that he would ask for an increase in the
                        level of the program beginning in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961. I
                        had thought the President’s instruction was to get a group together to see
                        what could be accomplished through reprogramming, having in mind that if the
                        residual figure were quite small it could be left over to next year.
                        Accordingly, I spoke to the President later in the day. He confirmed that
                        what he wanted was to have the group in to see what they thought they could
                        agree upon in the way of reprogramming. In connection with this
                        consideration, they should address themselves to the question of what is the
                        best thing for the President to do in acting on the <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> recommendations. If the problem can
                        be met through reprogramming, this would be most desirable. If not, is there
                        any practical and satisfactory method to proceed other than sending up a
                        supplemental.</p>

                    <p>In remarks at the annual meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on April 27,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> spoke of the
                        benefits of military and economic assistance and of the role private
                        industry could play in these efforts. In addition to making private
                        investments abroad and promoting a greater volume of trade, business could
                        create “a better national awareness of the challenge before” the United
                        States and the response it required. “Success,” the President asserted,
                        “demands the force of an informed public opinion to strengthen the
                        instruments of freedom in the free world community.” U.S. business and
                        community leaders were in a unique position to “promote the understanding
                        through which the needed public opinion can be produced.” For text, see <hi

                    <p>On April 29, the President forwarded copies of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> Committee’s preliminary report to
                        Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, in his capacity
                        as President of the Senate, and to Speaker of the House of Representatives
                            <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName>. In identical covering
                        letters, Eisenhower endorsed the Committee’s findings, stating they
                        confirmed “the imperative need for Congress to authorize and appropriate the
                        full amount requested for both economic and military assistance in the
                        Mutual Security Program for Fiscal Year 1960.” But even if the Congress did
                        appropriate the full <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0490"/>sum, he noted,
                        it might be necessary to request additional funds later. Text is <hi

                            >Draper</persName> Committee dealing with the organization and
                        administration of the Military Assistance Program and submit the following
                        preliminary comments both in my capacity as Acting Secretary of State and as
                        Coordinator of the Mutual Security Program.</p>
                    <p>As indicated in our earlier discussions of this subject, I fully support the
                        two basic concepts recommended by the Committee: (1) the strengthening of
                        the Secretary of State’s position in the foreign policy direction and
                        coordination of this program and (2) the focusing of responsibility on the
                        Department of Defense for the program’s administration and execution.</p>
                    <p>We have previously accepted your decisions regarding (1) the transfer of the
                        military assistance funds to the Department of Defense budget and the
                        continuing authorization of such funds and (2) corresponding clarification
                        of the responsibilities of the Secretary of State for foreign policy
                        direction and program, as transmitted last week to the Senate Foreign
                        Relations Committee in the form of an Executive Branch position.<note n="2"

                    <p>I find in any event that in several important respects the Committee’s

                        the two basic concepts set out in the second paragraph above. They would
                        seem, however, to fragment and diffuse even further the lines of executive
                        responsibility for the coordination of this program and would in effect
                        place back upon you the responsibility for day-to-day coordination, which
                        has been recently delegated to me. I feel this to be contrary to the general
                        principles of executive organization you and your Advisory Committee on
                        Government Organization have indicated you wish to see followed. I believe
                        accordingly that the <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName>
                        Committee’s detailed recommendations should be thoroughly examined and
                        analyzed in the light of the action taken by Congress on the current
                        legislative recommendations before any conclusions are reached. As
                        Coordinator of the Mutual Security Program, I have directed that such a
                        study be prepared and we will submit to you at a later date the Executive
                        Branch analysis and recommendations.</p>
                    <p>In the meanwhile, I recommend that the Committee’s detailed report be
                        withheld from publication until such time as the study referred to above can
                        be completed and final Executive Branch positions are reached. I have no
                        objection to publication of the summary letter of transmittal.</p>

                        considered very serious the following: (1) the House 10% reduction in
                        military assistance in face of the <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1"
                            >Draper</persName> Report requesting additional funds; (2) the directive

                        items where the Department’s objections were not so serious, but it would be
                        desirable to avoid them.</p>

                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> expressed some favor for
                        the amendment concerning expropriation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> saw some merit in the principle but felt that it
                        should not be a mandatory requirement, and Sen. <persName corresp="#p_BS1"
                            >Bridges</persName> suggested State make that position clear.</p>
                    <p>The President then requested comments from others present. Sen. Wiley
                        stressed the desirability of a strong position on mutual security by the
                        President and perhaps some sort of reassurance to domestic manufacturers
                        hurt by imports, as for instance the shoe industry. Sen. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> recounted some of the
                        Committee in-fighting and expected that the bill as reported by the
                        Committee could be upheld on the Senate Floor. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRB1">Chiperfield</persName> noted that the item concerning
                        a 30% transfer from one activity to another was permissive and would help
                        overcome the military assistance reduction. He felt that the Democratic
                        Majority would support the Committee bill without further reduction. Mrs.
                        Bolton noted the unsuccessful effort made to eliminate the mandatory
                        provision regarding expropriation.</p>
                    <p>The President stressed the large portion of the military assistance program
                        required immediately for Korea, Taiwan and Viet Nam, leaving not a great
                        deal for other necessary activities.</p>
                    <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0493"/>
                    <p>Rep. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Halleck</persName> raised the question as to
                        whether Republicans on the Floor should endeavor to restore the items cut or
                        merely work to prevent further cuts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> and the President both felt that was up to the
                        Leaders to determine, though the President wondered if there would be more
                        of a chance for restoring strictly the military assistance item. Rep.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Halleck</persName> thought it necessary to
                        inquire further as to the risks involved in opening up the Committee
                        bill.</p>

                    <p>It is not clear to me to what degree this meeting will either (a) replace the
                        discussions between you and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName>
                        which he had suggested take place this month or (b) narrow the range of such
                        discussions. However, I would hope that in any case you could have a
                        reasonably early discussion with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                            >Stans</persName> with a view to firming to the maximum degree possible
                        the order of magnitude within which we are to plan our <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 program. I am firmly convinced that
                        there is very little to gain by a repetition of our previous practice of
                        presenting requirements in magnitudes which have no possibility whatsoever
                        of serious consideration and that it is to everyone’s advantage to reach
                        agreement at an early date. As nearly as I can see, the controversial areas
                        are pretty well confined to the question of the dimension of military
                        assistance on the one hand and the figure for <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                            >DLF</gloss> on the other. I would hope that it would be possible to
                        reach agreement with <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> on all of
                        the figures but, even if military assistance and the Development Loan Fund
                        were left as variables, obtaining his concurrence that we could plan for the
                        non-military requirements in the dimensions suggested would enable us to
                        have a much more effective and orderly program development and would assist
                        our job of constructing the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961
                        presentation quite materially. I think there is a considerable sympathy for
                        this point of view both in <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and in the
                        Bureau although I don’t believe that either has taken an agency
                        position.</p>
                    <p>We are planning to get guidelines to the field for the development of the
                        non-military fiscal year 1961 program by the end of this month. These
                        guidelines will necessarily include a schedule for preparation of material
                        and its review in Washington. The timing of this schedule and its structure
                        can be materially influenced if, by the first of July, we have an
                        understanding with the Bureau as to the acceptability of the order of
                        magnitude we have set forth in our projections. The situation on the
                        military program is somewhat more advanced, and presents rather different
                        problems but, needless to say, settlement on the figures which you and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> agreed to back would be
                        most helpful. I cannot see we would be in any better position to debate them
                        with the Bureau a few months from now than we are at this time. It is
                        perfectly apparent that requirements for greater amounts can be identified
                        and put forward; it is equally apparent that our projections probably
                        represent the outside dimension of compatibility with the budgetary problem.
                        Consequently, I would think that it would be well worthwhile to negotiate
                        this one out with the Bureau now on a broad basis.</p>
                    <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0495"/>
                    <p>I am not suggesting that a more detailed review of the composition of the
                        programs would be denied to the Bureau but rather that we at least can
                        proceed on the basis of a common mutual assumption as to the dimensions
                        within which programs are to be reviewed and justified.</p>
                    <p>So far as the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> is concerned, it makes much
                        less difference whether a figure is decided now or later since the
                        justification does not depend on the construction of a detailed program but
                        rather on an entirely different kind of argument. It would not seriously
                        damage our position if we had to wait some time on this figure since
                        presumably the justification would be essentially the same whether the
                        figure was 700 or more.</p>

                    <p>On July 23, the House Appropriations Committee released testimony by
                        Comptroller General Campbell criticizing the administration of U.S. foreign
                        aid programs. Among the items Campbell cited was failure by the Department
                        of Defense and the International Cooperation Administration to provide their
                        reports to the General Accounting Office. Regarding Campbell’s statement,

                    <p>The following day, the Committee reported the Mutual Security appropriations
                        bill, H.R. 8385. H.R. 8385 appropriated $743,495,000 less than President

                        one forbidding expenditure of any Mutual Security funds, except those for
                        military assistance, should the International Cooperation Administration
                        fail to provide documents requested by the Congress or the General

                    <p>On August 17, the <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> Committee
                        submitted its final report to the President; for text, see H. Doc. 215,
                        Eighty-sixth Congress, First Session. The Committee’s covering letter
                        restated its support for the Mutual Security Program, asserting much of the
                        criticism aimed at it was unjustified. Little improvement in this situation
                        could be expected, however, without changes in the program’s administration.
                        The Committee reiterated its previous recommendations for increased Mutual
                        Security funds and predicted the outcome if appropriations continued to
                        decline. It discussed the Communist effort worldwide and the response
                        required from the United States and its economically advanced allies to
                        combat it. “The challenge,” it concluded, “points to the need for greater
                        unity of purpose, for a more dynamic effort, for combining and exchanging
                        among all the free world the benefit of skills and energies of those that
                        compose it. In such a combination and use of these skills and energies, we
                        believe the required new dynamism can be found.” (<hi rend="italic">American

                            n="2" xml:id="d246fn2">Eisenhower left Washington on August 26 for
                            consultations with European leaders at Bonn, London, and Paris,
                            returning September 7.</note> would be to get our allies to participate
                        more in this effort. The President could not understand how people could
                        oppose the money for development programs when they were willing to vote
                        incomparably larger sums for military defense. He would prefer to cut $5
                        billion from the latter to use for development in this vital field.</p>
                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName> stated his concurrence
                        with the President’s views, and then spoke of the need for military
                        assistance funds for maintaining <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The
                        President replied in terms of how the U.S. got into the Korean War because
                        of lack of funds and the continuing need for supporting Rhee’s divisions at
                        present. He commented wryly on the willingness of Congress to put much money
                        into other areas where it could not profitably be used, as in medical
                        research.</p>

                    <p>The Senate passed the Mutual Security appropriations bill, H.R. 8385,
                        September 14. On the following day, House and Senate conferees reported a
                        compromise version of the bill which appropriated $704,182,000 less than
                        President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had originally
                        requested. Among the bill’s provisions were a requirement that the President
                        submit a report to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on the
                        allotment of funds provided by H.R. 8385 and a prohibition on the
                        expenditure of Mutual Security funds, except those for military assistance,
                        should the International Cooperation Administration fail to furnish within
                        35 days documents requested by the Congress or the General Accounting
                        Office, unless the President forbade their disclosure. (H. Rept. 1190,
                        Eighty-sixth Congress, First Session)</p>
                    <p>The Senate adopted the compromise bill by voice vote early on September 15,
                        the House by roll call vote the same day. H.R. 8385 thus became P.L. 86–383,
                        the Mutual Security Appropriation Act, 1960, which provided $3,225,813,000
                        for the Mutual Security Program in fiscal year 1960. Eisenhower signed P.L.

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the group had come in
                        to discuss the Military Assistance Program for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss>–61. He said that State and Defense had recommended a program
                        of $2.3 billion and Budget had indicated they would not recommend a program
                        above $1.4 billion. He said that the program as developed by State and
                        Defense reflected the best and most thorough preparation of any program to
                        date. Because the difference is so wide, however, he did not think it would
                        be worthwhile to take up details of the program. While the State-Defense
                        submission could be varied by 10% without too much difficulty, any such
                        change as suggested by the Budget would breach our present foreign policy
                        and security policy.</p>
                    <p>Last year, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated he had
                        agreed to going in for $1.6 billion and referred to the study by the
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> Committee in relation to
                        a possible increase above that figure. The <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1"
                            >Draper</persName> Committee recommended an additional $400 million.
                        After long argument, the Administration took the position it could not ask
                        for the additional funds last year, and the request was put off for tactical
                        reasons. The President had, however, told the Congress he would have to ask
                        for more funds if the Congress made a cut in the Military Aid program, which
                        they did. He said he and Defense had spread the funds thin to cover the
                        program this year, but could not do it again. He recalled that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had told the President that any
                        substantial unilateral cut in U.S. aid programs without prior consultation
                        would be extremely damaging to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.<note

                            corresp="#p_VT1">Voorhees</persName> had said that if the Administration
                        dropped below a $2 billion request this year this would be very

                        Committee. They had made a searching review of basic policy, and concluded
                        that anything less than $2 billion would be taken as a change of security
                        concept.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> then said that the Defense
                        Department is very conscious of the foreign policy aspects of the Military
                        Aid program. He said it is a close mixture of military and political
                        considerations. There are four classes of recipient nations—those that will
                        be allies in war, those <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0502"/>where we
                        have bases, those having the potential of helping us in war or in actions to

                        foreign policy motivations. He then made a brief presentation with charts of
                        the program<note n="3" xml:id="d249fn3">Not found.</note> for the
                        information of the President.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether this proposal took account of the reduced
                        valuation on old equipment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"
                            >Irwin</persName> said that it did, but commented that the program is
                        shifting to newer weapons. The President asked why so much money is destined
                        for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said that $15 million is for the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, for the Thor program. There is nothing for
                        Germany. There is $30 million for France to finish a past commitment. The
                        major programs are for Greece and Turkey, with sizeable programs also for
                        the Netherlands and Italy. The Netherlands has stepped up its outlays, and
                        has in fact possibly taken on too much. Italy is increasing as much as it
                        should, in wisdom. In both of these countries the aid is being given on a
                        matching basis. If a major review were to be made, this would be all right,
                        but no unilateral decision should be taken on a program we have agreed to.
                        He commented that the force goals in Greece and the Netherlands may well be
                        somewhat too high. The Belgians are not doing enough themselves; however,
                        what we are giving them is on a matching basis. The size of the Portuguese
                        program is related to our need to retain the Azores bases. The President
                        asked why we have not talked with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        partners and told them that they must take on more of the load. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that we had done so,
                        and it was as a result of these talks that our aid was put on a matching
                        basis in many cases.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that the bigger the Mutual Security program is, the
                        more the Congress is given the chance to balance the budget at the expense
                        of the <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>. Personally, he believes this is
                        the biggest and best investment for America that can be made. It does give
                        the political opposition a chance to increase other programs in the budget
                        without increasing the over-all total, simply by drawing money from this
                        source.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said we should not
                        discredit the <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> Report. He
                        thought we could keep an unassailable public position if the approved aid
                        figure stayed over $2 billion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"
                            >Irwin</persName> said that if it is kept at $2.1 to $2.3 billion we
                        will have a sound program which we can defend against any attack. If the sum
                        is less, we become much more vulnerable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> commented that we already have the authorization for
                        this year, and it will only be necessary to go up to Congress once—i.e., for
                        appropriations. He commented that Congressman <persName corresp="#p_POE1"
                            >Passman</persName> is more reasonable this year, but this is not saying
                        much.</p>
                    <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0503"/>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said the difference
                        between himself and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> is the
                        difference between $3.5 and $4.9 billion. There is question of policy
                        involved. The higher figure would in his opinion knock out any possibility
                        of achieving an $80 billion budget. He thought the general attitude in
                        Congress and in the country is adverse to this program. The President said
                        he recognized this but felt that this attitude was wrong and that if he had
                        the choice he would take $1 billion out of the Defense appropriation and put
                        it in <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                            >Stans</persName> then said he thought he should take up the proposed
                        program with State and Defense in detail. He added that he is fearful that
                        if the Administration asks for more funds for this purpose than last year
                        the whole budget posture would be destroyed and other departments would
                        demand increases. The President said he disagreed utterly and completely
                        with this view, so long as he felt the increased funds were truly necessary.
                        He did not think they were in the case of many of the other departments. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said he was speaking of
                        public opinion, and wished to urge that we keep within the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–60 submissions.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what total figure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> was proposing and the reply was a figure of $4.9
                        billion. The President then asked what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> felt he could justify as really firm needs for the
                        program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he thought
                        it could be gotten down to about $4.4 billion but not below. This is not too
                        far from the figure requested last year.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said the question
                        is whether the President wished to go to Congress with the largest peacetime
                        budget in history. He commented that every program must be looked at both
                        for itself and in over-all terms. The President said that his great problem
                        is to take care of the things that have to be done such as defense, payment
                        of interest and the Mutual Security program—to find the funds for these
                        things without giving way to increases all along the line, many of which are
                        not necessary at all. He felt that a figure of $4.9 billion would strain the
                        budget very badly and that several hundred million of this probably is not
                        strictly necessary. He asked State and Budget to see if a program could be
                        worked out at that general level that would meet needs all around. He
                        commented that we have never been able to get across the idea to the
                        Congress or to the public that through this program we are keeping wars from
                        occurring.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the President’s query as to any need for increases in
                        other parts of the Mutual Security program, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said he wants to add to the Development Loan Fund at
                        least as much as was asked for last year. He would like to go up to $850
                        million. The President asked the group to study an over-all figure of about
                        $3.9 billion. He said this is by no means sacrosanct, however. He does not
                            <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0504"/>wish to make his decision on
                        budgetary factors alone. If a figure this small would involve undue risk, it
                        could well be false economy since the cost to us later would be much
                        greater.</p>
                    <p>He asked that the group be prepared to see him later the same week or early
                        in the next.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi></p>

                    <p>The President noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        had mentioned the Inter-American Bank in his presentation. The President
                        understood that a certain percentage of the capital of the Bank must be paid
                        in by the end of this year. He had heard that payments were slow in coming
                        in.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that 85% of
                        the Bank’s capital must be paid in by December 31, 1959, but only 53% had
                        been received. The Department of State had transmitted a notice to our Latin
                        American embassies pointing out that unless there was an acceleration in
                        Latin American accessions to the Bank we would have to request Congress to
                        extend the December 31 deadline.<note n="3" xml:id="d250fn3">Not

                    <p>The President said action should be taken to speed up the Latin American
                        accessions. He then referred to a chart displayed by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d250fn15">Not
                            found.</note> showing that the Sino-Soviet Bloc had committed $912
                        million in economic aid to Free World countries in the first eleven months
                        of 1959 and had 4675 technicians stationed in these countries. The United
                        States had 5700 technicians stationed in countries receiving assistance and
                        U.S. appropriations for economic and technical assistance in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 were nearly two billion dollars.
                        However, he did not feel that the figures showing the relative U.S. and
                        Soviet efforts were strictly comparable. Our appropriations figure included
                        both money for direct grants and money for the salaries of our
                        officials.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that exact
                        comparisons between the U.S. and Soviet figures he had presented would be
                        misleading. His purpose in mentioning Soviet assistance had been to show
                        that this assistance was substantial and was increasing.</p>
                    <p>The President said he wished to ask an accounting question. Did Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> have at hand any statistics which
                        indicated how much of our assistance expenditure was attributable to
                        overhead in Washington and in the field and how much went into actual
                        equipment furnished other countries?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that administrative
                        costs on the economic side of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> amounted
                        to about $41 million a year, while the administrative cost for the
                        Development Loan Fund was about $2 million a year.</p>
                    <p>The President, noting that Congress usually gets competitive when its
                        attention is called to Soviet aid activities, expressed further interest in
                        the figure of 4675 Soviet technicians. Apparently, the Soviets had 4675
                        propagandists for an expenditure of $912 million, whereas we spent more
                        money and had fewer propagandists. He wondered how many of the Soviet
                        technicians were actually technicians and how many were subversion experts.
                        He thought some kind of comparison between U.S. and Soviet efforts might be
                        useful.</p>
                    <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0506"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that some Soviet
                        technicians in the underdeveloped countries were propagandists, but pointed
                        out that many were “pure technicians” with no political assignment, as
                        indicated by the fact that many Soviet technicians sent abroad did not speak
                        the local language. For example, Iraq now has a large number of Soviet and
                        no U.S. technicians; but the Soviet technicians find their situation
                        difficult because they speak neither the local language nor English (which
                        is a second language in Iraq). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> added that the Soviets had 1000 technicians in India
                        while we had only 150, the reason for the difference being the Soviet
                        construction of a steel mill.</p>
                    <p>The President said that any curve designed to show increased Soviet aid
                        efforts would have to take into account Soviet long-term grants recently
                        extended as well as current expenditures. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> pointed out that the chart on Soviet
                        aid did not include the military assistance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> wondered whether it was not
                        dangerous in presentations to Congress to separate economic and military
                        assistance as completely as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> had separated them in his presentation. Such a
                        separation opened the way for the tactic of driving a wedge between economic
                        and military assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        felt a separation between the two forms of assistance was necessary and
                        noted that Congress was tentatively thinking of dealing with the two types
                        of assistance separately. The President said the press had caught him on
                        this question in a recent press conference.<note n="5" xml:id="d250fn5"
                            >Eisenhower presumably was referring to his press conference the
                            previous day, when, in responding to a reporter’s question, he had been
                            unsure if and when the foreign military assistance appropriation would
                            be included in the defense budget. See <hi rend="italic">Public Papers
                                of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then called
                        attention to a particular danger existing in connection with Soviet loans to
                        India. Some Soviet aid has been provided to India in the form of rupee loans
                        repayable at Soviet option in products, in rupees or in pounds sterling (the
                        currency in which Indian monetary reserves are maintained). The Soviets have
                        been drawing down the Indian pound sterling reserves. India is in a position
                        where the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can determine its trade
                        balance and its monetary reserves. There appeared to be no immediate danger
                        in this situation, but he was nervous about the possibility of Soviet
                        pressure on the Indian reserves. However, if Indian reserves fell to a
                        sufficiently low point, India could draw against the International Monetary
                        Fund, or might be faced with the necessity of imposing an embargo on
                        sterling withdrawals.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the situation
                        described by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        stemmed from the original Soviet-Indian aid agreement. The Indians had not
                        agreed to similar provisions in later agreements.</p>
                    <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0507"/>
                    <p>The President said wherever the Soviets made loans in rubles and did not
                        permit repayment in rubles, the borrower was receiving less than he appeared
                        to be receiving.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> referred again to the
                        chart on Soviet economic aid and asked whether the figure given by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> for U. S. technicians
                        abroad included personnel sent abroad by U.S. contractors and engineering
                        firms. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the figures
                        did not include personnel of private contractors unless under contract to
                        the government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said the
                        comparison made between numbers of U.S. and Soviet technicians was not a
                        good one; all Soviet technicians but not all U.S. technicians were included.
                        The President remarked that this result stemmed from the fact that the
                        Soviets had a system of state capitalism. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1"
                            >McCone</persName> said Russian technicians were undoubtedly
                        indoctrinated and ours should be. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said a program was now under way in which businessmen
                        going abroad studied foreign affairs at American University, while some
                        Foreign Service Officers about to go to a new assignment abroad studied
                        business. The business community was financing this arrangement. The Vice
                        President felt the comparison made between U.S. and Soviet technicians
                        abroad was not a valid one in the sense that all Russian technicians abroad
                        were included in the figures, but only U.S. Government officials were
                        included. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> believed
                        private businessmen going abroad could do much for U.S. foreign policy if
                        they were properly indoctrinated. In response to a question from Mr.
                            <persName>Dulles</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said the figures on his chart for Sino-Soviet Bloc
                        technicians included Chinese Communist technicians.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said some of his studies
                        indicated that the figure for total Free World assistance to underdeveloped
                        countries was twice the U.S. figure. Responding to a question from the
                        President, he said the U.S. was providing about 50 per cent of the
                        assistance provided by the Free World. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                            >Stans</persName> also pointed out that there was a lag between Soviet
                        commitments and Soviet expenditures. Soviet expenditures were less than
                        one-fourth the Soviet commitments. Did this mean Soviet commitments were
                        very long-range or did it mean that these commitments were not carried out
                        completely? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said his
                        studies showed that during the period 1954–1958 all Soviet expenditures for
                        assistance totaled $375 million, while during the same period the Free World
                        spent $17 billion on assistance. In India there were 2400 Free World
                        technicians, counting both governmental and private contractor personnel.
                        There were about 99,000 U.S. technicians overseas, most of whom were
                        connected with private enterprise. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                            >Stans</persName> suggested that in future the Mutual Security Status
                        Report should take account of all factors in making a comparison of U.S. and
                        Soviet Bloc assistance to other countries.</p>
                    <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0508"/>
                    <p>The President agreed that studies of the kind suggested by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> would be useful. However, he felt it
                        was not correct to equate the activities of personnel overseas for private
                        enterprise with the activities of government officials indoctrinated in the
                        problems of the day, whether these officials were Soviet propagandists on
                        the one side or our technicians on the other side. Statistics of the type
                        mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> could provide
                        a good measure of normal business activity, but could not measure political
                        effort. U.S. propaganda must be as effective as Soviet propaganda if we are
                        to derive full advantage from our assistance programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought that an improved
                        statement of Soviet effort could be devised for future Status Reports.
                        However, he did not want the Council to form the impression that the Soviets
                        were not carrying out their aid commitments. The Soviets often make
                        long-range development assistance commitments and later decide toward which
                        specific projects the aid will be directed, a procedure which explains the
                        lag in Soviet practice between commitment and expenditure.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President believed it would be useful to stimulate the preparation
                        of some sound periodical articles on U.S. aid abroad. The President agreed,
                        noting that Senator Johnson had recently told him that it was difficult for
                        members of Congress to explain to the people why we cannot afford $800
                        million for public works while we are spending billions for foreign aid.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> pointed out that the Mutual
                        Security Status Report on Page 8 stated that: “Our policy statements
                        indicate that the unilateral contributions of European nations to less
                        developed areas ... and their anticipated increased contributions to
                        multilateral development organizations ...<note n="6" xml:id="d250fn6"
                            >Ellipses in the source text.</note> are not to substitute for U.S.
                        assistance efforts but are to be essentially additive thereto.” Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> did not believe that any
                        provision of this kind appeared in our policy statements. On the contrary,
                        he felt it was consistent with our policy to expect that our contributions
                        to assistance would decrease as the contributions of others increased.</p>
                    <p>The President said the underdeveloped world needs new capital faster than it
                        can be obtained. We have recently been paying more attention to the serious
                        problem of overpopulation and we know that the world has an awakening sense
                        of justice and desire for better living conditions. He believed we could
                        sustain peace more effectively by economic aid expenditures than by the
                        provision of military equipment to other nations, even though military
                        assistance may be more popular in Congress and perhaps among the people. The
                        Free World was not providing enough assistance to underdeveloped countries.
                        We needed a better-coordinated effort by international society to raise the
                            <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0509"/>living standards of countries
                        with low standards. It might not be feasible for absolute amounts of U.S.
                        aid to be reduced as other nations contribute more, even though relative
                        U.S. aid falls.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> returned once more to the chart on Soviet
                        economic aid. He pointed out that the chart showed only Soviet Bloc aid to
                        the Free World, not Soviet Bloc aid in other countries of the Soviet Bloc.
                        The President said it was very difficult to get accurate comparisons of U.S.
                        and Soviet aid.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> then made a presentation
                        on the military assistance aspects of the status of the mutual security
                        program on June 30, 1959 and the mutual security program for <gloss

                    <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName>’s
                        presentation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said the
                        Planning Board had been concerned about the statement in the Mutual Security
                        Status Report (Page 2, Par. 3) that this year’s drop in military aid
                        appropriations must be almost entirely absorbed in force modernization,
                        resulting in progressive deterioration in the effectiveness of vitally
                        needed Free World forces. Did this mean that we are only able to provide
                        maintenance and unable to carry out modernization? Were we wasting our
                        investment on outmoded forces and equipment?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> replied that the $2
                        billion military assistance request would permit some modernization. About
                        $1.4 billion of the $2 billion would be spent for maintenance of the status
                        quo, as assistance for political reasons, and so on, leaving about $600
                        million that might be spent for modernization and improvement of forces.</p>

                        the Treasury analysis of nations financially able to purchase military
                        equipment and training, as circulated by the reference memorandum of
                        November 19.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said the Treasury
                        Department had attempted to determine the financial ability of countries to
                        purchase military equipment by examining their resources positions. Except
                        for the U.K., most of the countries scrutinized had a resources position
                        superior to that of the U.S. inasmuch as the U.S. resources position had
                        recently declined while that of other countries had been strengthened.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> thought the
                        question was whether, after the financial ability of a country is
                        determined, we should say to ourselves, “This country is financially able to
                        pay, but will it?” In other words, if the government of a country in a good
                        resources position is unable to induce its parliament to adopt measures
                        providing for the purchase of its military requirements, should we regard
                        that country as unable to pay, even though it has the ability from the
                        strictly financial point of view? In Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName>’s view, we should not assure a nation that we will
                        continue to provide it with military assistance because of its political
                        difficulties, if it is financially able to pay for its military equipment.
                        In purchasing their military requirements, other Free World countries would
                        be safeguarding their own security. We must take the position that a
                        country’s political problems are its own internal affair; we must call upon
                        countries able to pay for their military equipment to do so. The U.S. could
                        not continue to absorb the political difficulties of other countries.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then reported
                        that, together with the Vice President, he had recently talked to Mr. <pb

                            >Spaak</persName>,<note n="10" xml:id="d250fn10">No record of this
                            conversation has been found.</note> who had been asked by the Vice
                        President whether European countries able to pay would do their full share
                        in mutual defense. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had
                        replied that if the U.S. would explain the problem fully and frankly to its
                        European allies before it reduced its own forces, such of these others as
                        were financially able would do their full share.</p>
                    <p>The President said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had told
                        him the same thing.<note n="11" xml:id="d250fn11">Regarding this
                            conversation, see <ref target="#d249fn2">footnote 2, Document
                            249</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Continuing, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        expressed the view that financial ability to pay and political willingness
                        to pay should not be confused. He would be willing to continue grants for
                        military training, which was a good human relation. But in the future the
                        greater part of expenditures for military equipment in any country would be
                        in the field of advanced weapons. The majority language in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5916 would in practice make no change in
                        existing policy with respect to grant assistance for advanced weapons, since
                        it provides that the Secretary of State and Defense may, in the case of
                        selected advance weapons, make exceptions to the general principle of no new
                        commitments for grant assistance.</p>
                    <p>The President said he objected to making the provisions of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5916 firm policy before the Secretary of
                        State had been given an opportunity to prepare the way in conversations with
                        the governments affected. He felt we must bring foreign governments to
                        understand the nature of their responsibilities for defense. Explaining the
                        situation to these governments fully and frankly would be the safety valve
                        of the policy proposed in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5916. The
                        President also wondered about the inclusion of Italy in the list of
                        countries which were not to receive grant military assistance. He felt we
                        must help Italy keep its Communist Party down.</p>
                    <p>The President then said that, in principle, he believed in the
                        Treasury-Budget version of the split in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        5916. The policy proposed by Treasury and Budget was our objective; that is,
                        new commitments for the provision of military equipment on a grant basis
                        should not be offered to nations which are financially able to pay for such
                        equipment. At some stage we would have to state this policy frankly, but now
                        was not the time for such a frank statement; the way must be prepared first.
                        The President said that when he went to Europe as <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> Commander, he agreed to go only as an emergency measure.
                        However, no political authority had ever publicly indicated the emergency
                        nature of our military program in Europe.</p>
                    <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0512"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he would be
                        content with a statement of policy indicating that we should now inform
                        appropriate countries diplomatically that we intended by mid-1960 to
                        announce a policy of no new commitments for the provision of grant military
                        equipment to nations financially able to pay for such equipment.</p>
                    <p>The President said such a policy would then be put into effect at some future
                        time following its announcement.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Gates observed that this policy would involve a review of <gloss
                            target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70.</p>
                    <p>The President felt that compromise plans such as <gloss target="#t_MC1"
                            >MC</gloss>–70 had a tendency to become sacrosanct. General Ridgway had
                        once told him that the Army must meet a commitment of deploying twelve
                        divisions to Europe within six months of the outbreak of war. The President
                        had told General Ridgway that this concept was as outmoded as the crossbow.
                        The President thought our policy should be based on up-to-date estimates of
                        the situation; we should not allow past plans to become as sacrosanct as the
                        laws of the Medes and the Persians.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> said he had no
                        quarrel with the objective of refraining from making new commitments for
                        grant assistance for military equipment to nations financially able to pay.
                        He was, however, worried about the method by which such an objective was to
                        be achieved. The language in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5916
                        proposed by Treasury and Budget would put the Department of State in a
                        strait-jacket. Forthcoming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meetings
                        would probably prove a mechanism for reassessment of European military
                        requirements, but it would be unwise for the U.S. to begin these meetings
                        with a threat to reduce its military assistance.</p>
                    <p>The President said it was not necessary to give definitive approval to the
                        policy of no new commitments at this time. Approval of such a policy could
                        come later. However, we ought to agree that our ultimate objective is the
                        one stated in the Treasury-Budget language: no new commitments for grant
                        military equipment to nations able to pay. Of course it might be necessary
                        to make some exceptions to this general principle.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> pointed out that
                        different considerations might apply with respect to each country
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then quoted from a
                        recent statement by the Belgian Defense Minister<note n="12"
                            xml:id="d250fn12">Not further identified.</note> which indicated that
                        Belgium expected assistance in larger amounts than the U.S. had programmed
                        for Belgium.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked that our allies often forget that we pay the full cost
                        of the deterrent forces for the Free World, the world’s largest navy, and so
                        forth. The U.S., as the “reserve position” of the <pb n="481"
                            xml:id="pg_481" facs="0513"/>Free World, ought to have mobile forces
                        able to move rapidly to any threatened area; but our allies must have the
                        strength to hold on until our forces arrive. In addition to our mobile
                        forces, we should have small forces stationed in various threatened areas as
                        a means of showing the flag and giving evidence of our intention to defend
                        our allies. However, we should not permit commitments to become frozen like
                        a river of ice.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he shared the view
                        that countries financially able to pay for their military equipment should
                        do so. France was certainly in the category of countries able to pay.
                        However, with respect to some other countries the question of financial
                        ability to pay became a difficult one. Ultimately the question was a
                        question of subjective judgment. He did not agree that some of the countries
                        on the Treasury list of nations financially able to pay were in fact able to
                        pay. The important thing was to induce our allies to carry their full share
                        of the defense burden as rapidly as possible. Not simply political
                        willingness, but political capability was involved in this matter. Moreover,
                        mutual defense involves our national security as well as the security of our
                        allies. This principle is especially relevant in the case of a country like
                        Japan. Assistance to Japan is helping Japan substitute its strength for
                        major U.S. naval bases which would otherwise be required in the Far East.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then referred to the
                        U.S.-Japanese negotiations for a new security treaty and pointed out that if
                        Japan failed to maintain its present security position, grave damage to U.S.
                        security in the Far East would result. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> felt there were other ways of collecting money from
                        Japan. That country had, for example, just agreed to settle <gloss
                            target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> up to $600 million at $30 million a
                        year. We could press hard in this area and in connection with trade; but if
                        we say we are not interested in cost-sharing for military equipment we would
                        be doing grave damage to our own security. With respect to the financial
                        capabilities of any given country, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> wished to point out that while a country could carry
                        a greater load if it would reduce its non-defense expenditures, some of
                        these expenditures were as deeply embedded in that country’s culture as our
                        expenditures were embedded in ours.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he wished to conclude
                        his remarks by referring briefly to The Netherlands. This country had worked
                        hard to be loyal to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Its <gloss
                            target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> was low, it had lost Indonesia, it had a
                        refugee problem as a result of the loss of its colonies, its tax burden was
                        the heaviest in the Free World and its financial resources were staying
                        level, not increasing. The <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70 goals
                        accepted by The Netherlands were too high and must be revised. The
                        Netherlands was not financially able to pay for its military equipment on
                        the basis of the present goals.</p>

                    <p>The President felt it would be necessary to examine the situation in each
                        country individually in an effort to determine exactly what the facts are
                        with respect to that country. The policy embodied in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5916 could not be adopted until more specific information
                        on each country was available. However, he was weary of accepting our
                        allies’ dependence on us forever. He suggested the possibility of submitting
                        to each of our allies an Aide-Mémoire stating our long-term objectives in
                        the matter of grant assistance for military equipment.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then read a proposed Record of
                        Action paragraph substantially along the lines of sub-paragraph b below. The
                        President concurred in this proposal, adding that the Departments of State
                        and Defense should consult with all interested agencies in taking steps to
                        achieve our objective.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the group had come in
                        to put before the President the broad lines proposed for the Mutual Security
                        Program and message this year, and to bring up one or two specific points of
                        issue. He proceeded to review a topical outline proposed for the message,
                        copy attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d251fn2">Not found.</note> During this
                        review he commented that all of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        countries are doing more in terms of increased military programs. He said
                        there is no grant assistance planned for Britain, France, and Germany except
                        the clean-up of certain small previous commitments. The President suggested
                        that the message bring out that the Mutual Security Program, in addition to
                        improving the economic status of recipient countries, improves their
                        strength and stability and thereby contributes to American security.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that one matter
                        reflected in the speech and in the program material prepared for submission
                        to the Congress is the position of the Budget and the Treasury against
                        releasing money in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–60 program proposed
                        for Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. He recalled that the President and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> had made statements to our
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies that we are not going to
                        make unilateral changes in programs affecting our allies.</p>
                    <p>The President commented strongly that we cannot run out on defense agreements
                        and commitments we have made. We cannot be guilty of bad faith with our
                        allies. Mr. <persName>Staats</persName> pointed out that the difference of
                        view relates to the Netherlands and Italy, and does not include, as Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had suggested, programs
                        related to <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the issue is over <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–60 funds. The President stated that he felt
                        this is a matter that is already decided. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"
                            >Irwin</persName> recalled that we have made a broad committment not to
                        make abrupt or unilateral changes in the program.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether the United States has, for example, with respect
                        to the program for Belgium, undertaken with them to determine what the
                        requirements are and then how much the Belgians can pay. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said that this has been done and
                        that the filling of <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0516"/>these
                        requirements necessitates continued sharing of costs. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> mentioned some of the specifics
                        entering into these matching programs. The President said he thinks that a
                        little more joint study on this matter is needed for fiscal year 1961. He is
                        inclined to give a go-ahead on fiscal 1960. He asked that the Budget
                        representatives talk to State Department officials. He did not want to put a
                        halter around their neck, but thought that the question regarding fiscal
                        1960 is pretty much decided.</p>
                    <p>At Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s request, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BV1">Brand</persName> next gave a summary of Development
                        Loan Fund activity in Turkey, India and Pakistan related to the private
                        sector, i.e., to generating private capital to join with indigenous private
                        and public funds in those countries to build specific projects. The
                        President was keenly interested in this development and asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BV1">Brand</persName> to convey a message from him to a
                        group of private businessmen who will be meeting in Washington in the next
                        few days on this matter, indicating that officials in Turkey, Pakistan and
                        India had asked the President to assure American businessmen that these
                        countries would protect investments that were made and would give assurances
                        against seizure or undue risks.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> next raised the question of
                        U.S. aid and support to the Indus River project. He said there is need for
                        Congressional approval and endorsement of this program, waiver of certain
                        restrictive provisions of the <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>, and a
                        statement that the compliance with World Bank criteria would be considered
                        to satisfy requirements of the Mutual Security Act on economic soundness,
                        cost benefit ratios, and completion of engineering studies. The President
                        expressed strong support for the Indus River project. He commented that he
                        hoped this would help toward a settlement in Kashmir, recalling some of his
                        efforts in this respect during his recent visit to Pakistan and India.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> next described to the
                        President the remarkable progress now being made in Taiwan to strengthen its
                        financial and economic affairs and to expand its economy, especially its
                        industries. He is proposing that Taiwan serve as a “model” for other areas
                        and is recommending an incentive fund for development of new industries, to
                        be matched by funds from Taiwanese private enterprise. The President
                        expressed warm endorsement of this type of activity. He said he thought the
                        message as outlined was fine.</p>

                    <p>The President opened the meeting by stating that he would soon turn the
                        discussion over to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>,
                        it not being his desire to “bore everyone” by repeating his well-known
                        convictions on Mutual Security. The President stated that he could not vouch
                        for every particular figure in the following, but was recently advised by a
                        man who had made a detailed analysis of the entire international situation
                        that he was gravely concerned over the increasing costs of American
                        production and what this is coming to mean to United States prosperity and
                        American markets abroad.</p>
                    <p>This man advised that increasing costs are beginning seriously to affect our
                        relations with the one and a quarter billion people who live in
                        under-developed nations other than China. It was his understanding that in
                        these nations productivity has been increasing about 1% a year, whereas
                        their population has been increasing about 2%. If this be true, the
                        President stated, we must move to increase productivity abroad by about an
                        additional 1% if we possibly can, in the process of keeping the markets we
                        now have and regaining those we have lost. The President stated that the
                        people in these parts of the world will definitely better their conditions
                        and that this must be made possible for them or the world will surely end up
                        in chaos and disorder. He stated that he did not believe that the United
                        States should do all of this itself, but certainly we must do better. The
                        President said he had to repeat his conviction that our entire national
                        security and prosperity are tied up in this program of Mutual Security and
                        he reminded the group that in America’s earliest days we too were dependent
                        upon nations for investment and capital resources. He stated that this
                        meeting would be the last one of this kind with this particular group but
                            <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0518"/>that never has he been as sure
                        as he is now that America’s future is tied so tightly with this program
                        despite the adverse publicity the program has received. At this point he
                        turned the discussion over to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> explained that a
                        Presidential message to Congress would be sent forward the following day and
                        that hearings would shortly ensue in the Foreign Affairs Committee in the
                        House of Representatives. First, as to economic programs, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> explained that in
                        preparing these programs this year the Department had been guided in good
                        measure by the so-called <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>
                        Amendment which required that reports be prepared on all countries receiving
                        grant assistance to determine whether or not and how soon such countries
                        could have this kind of assistance reduced or eliminated. The Secretary
                        stated that this report should be available by the end of this month.<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d252fn1">Regarding the President’s message to the

                                “<persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> Amendment” is
                            Section 503(c) of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> submitted his report to the
                            Congress on February 29; for text of his transmittal letter, see

                            459–460. The report, which was classified, has not been found. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> sent an unclassified, general
                            summary report to the Congress on March 4. (<hi rend="italic"
                            >Ibid</hi>., pp. 460–465)</note> He said that the philosophy of this
                        report is already reflected in the program presented to the Congress,
                        because the funds requested for grant assistance had been reduced by $155
                        million under last year. He added that defense support alone had been
                        reduced by $111 million, a 13% reduction under last year.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that the funds requested in the new program are only
                        slightly above those appropriated last year for grant assistance. He pointed
                        out that a reduction is being requested also for the contingency fund.</p>
                    <p>As for the Development Loan Fund, he explained that the same amount is being
                        requested as was requested last year. He explained that these funds are
                        needed in order to make it possible to use more of these loans in place of
                        grant assistance.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that the second major change in the program this year is
                        military assistance—an increase being requested in this item of $700 million
                        above the amount appropriated last year in keeping with the recommendations
                        of the <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1">Draper</persName> Committee and because
                        the pipeline funds have been virtually exhausted. The Secretary stressed the
                        necessity for modernizing the forces of our friends abroad and stated that
                        an increase in military assistance is imperative to that end.</p>
                    <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0519"/>
                    <p>As far as the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations are concerned,
                        the Secretary stated that the policy is to have no new commitments to those
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries which are economically
                        the strongest—England, Germany and France and that these nations are being
                        urged to make cost-sharing agreements in assistance programs.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stressed that the program has a better schedule of requirements
                        than heretofore because unified commanders and our ambassadors have been
                        brought into the program sooner.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that $940 million more than last year’s appropriations
                        are being asked this year, the great majority of the increase being for
                        military assistance.</p>
                    <p>He cited the basic figures as being $4.175 billion requested, as compared
                        with $3.930 billion requested last year, as compared with $3.226 billion
                        appropriated last year.</p>
                    <p>Speaker <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> then stated that in the
                        House of Representatives there is a wide-spread feeling that there is a
                        tremendous amount of incompetence and waste in this program. He said that
                        there would be no difficulty on the military side of the program in the
                        House, but there will be great difficulty on the economic side of the
                        program. The Speaker emphasized that the people complaining to him have
                        stressed waste and incompetence, not graft or corruption, and that they
                        mention this in connection with economic aid. He identified the complaining
                        Congressmen as members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_MTE1">Tom Morgan</persName> observed that
                        military assistance is a continuing authorization, as is the Development
                        Loan Fund, so that in the authorization bill this year there is only $1.400
                        billion to be authorized. He stated that the so-called Pilcher subcommittee
                        returned from a trip abroad with bad reports on large projects, but that the
                        small projects seemed to be going well.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out,
                        respecting the larger projects, that these are being shifted from grants
                        programs to Development Loan Fund projects. He stated that no money is
                        included in this year’s request for any projects of any size under grant aid
                        except for a few now being completed in the Far East. He stated that because
                        of this arrangement he did not anticipate difficulties on these projects in
                        the future of the kind we have had in the past.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Taber</persName> asked the President
                        if we could not get along without technical assistance and other smaller
                        programs of this kind. The President responded that this is one of the best
                        parts of the whole program. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Taber</persName> said
                        that he would agree if the program were honestly run, “but it isn’t.” At
                        once the President responded, most vigorously, that it is very difficult to
                        get good personnel in this program because the Congress insists upon a year
                        by year program and has refused to put it on a career basis. He stated that
                        “the United States is coming <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0520"/>damn
                        close to making up its mind as to what we are going to do in the world, and
                        if it is to withdraw then we will have to recompute our whole position on
                        the face of the globe.” He stated that both this Mutual Security Program and
                        the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> programs will be much better off
                        if the personnel can be made career, and he feelingly commented on troubles
                        he had experienced in prior years (including, specifically, with <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJ1">Taber</persName>) trying vainly to get enough Army
                        funds, whereas today the Congress is lavish on defense but pinch-penny on
                        the no less vital Mutual Security Program.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that a new
                        study being made of the economic programs will be completed in about one
                        year, pointing out that these programs have not been tightly resurveyed for
                        the past decade. He said there is a possibility that some parts of the
                        program are no longer needed.</p>
                    <p>Senator Wiley stated that he has had a letter asking why it is necessary to
                        give additional assistance to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> when
                        they are in such excellent economic condition. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> explained that <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries are contributing far more
                        now—about 11% more—than last year. The President pointed out that Holland,
                        for instance, is contributing so much that there is some doubt whether or
                        not it can carry the load. Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1"
                            >Fulbright</persName> interjected to state that while we are approaching
                        this in a highly critical and conservative fashion, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is celebrating his new steel
                        mill in India as well as a lot of additional economic efforts in other parts
                        of the world on the part of the Soviet Union. He stated that the decision
                        that America must make is whether or not to turn the rest of the world over
                        to the Soviet Union; otherwise we must continue our own programs.</p>
                    <p>The Senator stated that he is much aware that in his own State this program
                        is highly unpopular, and so much so that in every speech he makes he has to
                        defend it. He says, however, that he does so unhesitatingly, because the
                        Nation faces a critical situation in the world and must meet the test.</p>
                    <p>The President reiterated that almost his entire life had been spent in
                        military service during a period in which every dollar invested in defense
                        was characterized as waste. Now, he said, everybody insists on spending
                        billions extra for defense, while scrimping on this particular program, an
                        essential part of our own defenses.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> repeated that it is
                        unpleasant and unpopular to support this program but there is no
                        alternative. He said it is most unfortunate that it has been made an annual
                        program. He stressed that here we are watching the Soviet Union going around
                        the world, in the Caribbean as well as in Asia, and we in this country are
                        getting started on a battle royal in the Congress (referring to civil
                        rights). He said that this battle in the Congress will make the situation
                        even more difficult. He said that as far as he is concerned he will support
                        this Mutual <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0521"/>Security program all
                        that he can. America has, he pointed out, more than twice the gross national
                        product of the Soviet Union. He said that we can afford this program, and we
                        must support it.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> suggested,
                        whimsically, to Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>
                        that the latter should live in <hi rend="italic">Chicago-Tribune</hi> area
                        in order to get a real feeling of the local impact of this program.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                            >Khrushchev</persName> had told him that none of us can afford this
                        business of destroying each other. However, the Soviets can place their
                        emphasis in certain particular places to achieve their results. Meanwhile
                        the United States must look after the concerns of all nations small or
                        large. He stated that our job is tough indeed but that our allies are today
                        a very large part of America’s initial defense—in fact, our outposts, even
                        though we cannot tell them so.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> stated that the free
                        world has at least three times the wealth of the Soviet Union so there is no
                        doubt that we can afford a vigorous effort for mutual security. The
                        President laughingly stated that he would come to Arkansas and put on a
                        toupee and support Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>
                        in that state because of his views on mutual security.</p>
                    <p>The President then thanked everyone present for coming to this meeting. He
                        stated that he doesn’t care if he is characterized as “a stupid ox” but he
                        believes profoundly in this program and will keep on saying so. He said that
                        if he should survive for the next decade there will be, before it is over, a
                        lot more converts to this program, because he is going to have something to
                        do with getting them.</p>
                    <p>Speaker <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> then commented that the
                        President’s bourbon tasted very good to them; he hoped that this would not
                        be, as the President had indicated, the last meeting of this group. The
                        President laughingly answered that this was only to be the last meeting “of
                        this kind.”</p>
                    <p>Thereupon at 6:15 pm the meeting adjourned.</p>

                        topics, including the International Development Association. For that part

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mutual Security</hi>—(The President left the meeting for
                        the period of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s
                        presentation.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the Admininstration
                        was asking $155 million less in grant programs than last year and only about
                        $150 million more than was authorized last year.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought the big problem
                        would come in the appropriations process where money would have to be
                        provided for things already authorized, as the Development Loan Fund and
                        military assistance. The big increase of the total program, he said, was
                        entirely in military assistance where $2 billion is being requested as
                        compared with the $1.3 billion appropriated last year.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> emphasized that we had used
                        up the possibility of living off the pipeline, which was once as high as $8
                        billion. Now, it will be necessary to appropriate about $2 billion every
                        year to maintain an expenditure rate of $2 billion. This year, deliveries
                        will be at only $1.8 billion, and even so that is $0.5 billion over the
                        appropriation.</p>
                    <p>Of the $2 billion being requested, $1.2 billion would be for maintaining
                        forces in various countries in the Far East, Turkey, and Greece; $800
                        million would be for modernization of forces, about equally divided between
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that no new
                        commitments would be made for military assistance to Germany, the United
                        Kingdom, or France. And in other countries, we are asking that they
                        themselves make a larger contribution to their own defense. He stated that
                        last year our allies had increased their efforts by about $1 billion, and
                        that there would be a further increase this year. Hence we look to the time
                        when they will be on their own.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that the liaison with
                        Congress would be handled by Mr. Ben Brown, the <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss> director in Libya, who has been recalled to substitute for
                        the ailing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPP1">Claxton</persName>.</p>
                    <p>(The President returned to the meeting.)</p>
                    <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0523"/>
                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> ascertained that the
                        United States would expend funds to help in the Thor combat training of the
                        English, and he concluded that despite Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName>’s earlier statement, we would be giving the British
                        some military assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName>
                        said that this would amount to $3.8 million for 1961.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Halleck</persName> asked about overseas
                        missile bases that form a part of our deterrent, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> enumerated them. Messrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SL1"
                            >Saltonstall</persName> recalled last year’s hassle over the status of
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Thor bases. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the <gloss
                            target="#t_RAF1">RAF</gloss> had announced, and appropriately
                        demonstrated, that these bases are fully operational.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Halleck</persName> digressed for a moment to
                        inform Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> about the
                        uneasiness that is developing over rumors that there would be a great many
                        tariff reductions resulting from the next <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said this stemmed from confusion over the preliminary
                        list, that each item was subject to study by the Tariff Commission which
                        could set peril points, and that in many of these items the reduction could
                        be at best only very small. Rep. Byrnes urged that a greater effort be made
                        to eliminate from such lists, before announcement, any items that had very
                        little potential for negotiation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> noted the innovation this year of having Commerce
                        Department work up for publication a list of items on which the U.S. would
                        ask concessions from other countries.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to the mutual security program, Sen. <persName corresp="#p_SL1"
                            >Saltonstall</persName> thought that all of the mutual security items
                        ought to be in a single bill instead of partially in the Defense
                        appropriations bill, so as to give the Administration greater flexibility
                        and increase its ability to get the best possible bill out of Congress.</p>
                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> foresaw some very serious
                        votes when some of the demagogues would endeavor to take funds away from
                        mutual security and apply them to our domestic security programs like the
                        B–70 or airborne alert, etc., etc. Sen. <persName corresp="#p_DEM1"
                            >Dirksen</persName> also thought so, then pointed to the probability
                        that Sen. <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Russell</persName> would accept an
                        increase of only $150 or $200 million.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that he had been breaking his heart over this for
                        seven years and apparently must do so once more. The United States just did
                        not seem to realize what was at stake here. It was essential to look at this
                        program not as something deserving sympathy but rather with a hardheaded
                        concern for our own best interests. Senators <persName corresp="#p_BS1"
                            >Bridges</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName>
                        referred to the difficulty of getting Democratic Presidential candidates to
                        support this, and Sen. <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> opined
                        that there were even more such candidates in the Senate than have yet been
                        announced.</p>
                    <p>The President recalled how <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon
                            Johnson</persName> had taken note of the $800 million increase, making a
                        total of $4 billion in the program for next year, then had said that while
                        he of course was not against it, <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0524"
                        />nevertheless every place he went in Texas he heard people complain about
                        money being spent overseas when there was no money available for a
                        particular dam they felt necessary. The President was insistent that this
                        program must be considered on a much broader basis than just any single dam.
                        There must be recognition of the fact that there were 1,250,000,000 people
                        outside of Red China who would have to have some sort of help unless chaos
                        is to result.</p>
                    <p>The President recounted his conversation with the King of Morocco<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d253fn2">A memorandum of this December 22, 1959, conversation is
                            printed in vol. XIII, p. 795. Eisenhower visited Casablanca during his
                            December 3–22, 1959, good will trip to Italy, Turkey, Pakistan,
                            Afghanistan, India, Iran, Greece, Tunisia, Spain, and Morocco, during
                            which he also attended a meeting of the Western Heads of State and
                            Government in Paris.</note> who urged that the United States must be
                        solidly in support of independence movements, and must take the lead in
                        finding ways to make it possible for these new countries to sustain
                        themselves. The President said he had agreed that these two things must be
                        done, but that they might better be done in reverse order; that is, that
                        independent countries might best maintain helpful ties with their parent
                        countries, as Algeria did in the past, until their economies gave promise of
                        sustaining independence. The King would not agree to this, however, and went
                        on to stress the great morale factor that is involved when a nation is able
                        to take a seat in the United Nations. The President said that despite this
                        mild debate he made it clear to the King that the United States does stand
                        firmly for the right of self-determination.</p>
                    <p>The President continued his remarks, noting that these African countries <hi
                            rend="italic">are</hi> going to become independent and are going to look
                        for help in one place or another. He thought that the one way he could see
                        for accomplishing anything in this respect was to get a cooperative effort
                        established where these countries could jointly put much into development
                        and thus have a stake in maintaining the political stability and the growth
                        of a whole area, something that would not result from simply a bilateral
                        program between the United States and any individual country. For the
                        moment, the President said, it was essential to get some of these people
                        educated a little bit on the need for a little more political stability; but
                        actually the task is a terrific amount bigger than just a business of
                        putting $200 million or even $700 million additional into the mutual
                        security program.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded by noting how long he had been talking about this
                        problem over the years and by joking that there was no point citing to him
                        the argument about high taxes—he was well experienced in that, particularly
                        since there had been an effective cut in the <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493"
                            facs="0525"/>Presidential salary just as he came into office by
                        eliminating a tax exemption that had applied previously.<note n="3"

                        under that action circulated by the reference Memorandum of February 17. (A

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> thought that minimum
                        comment from him was necessary on the report, which was self-explanatory. He
                        noted, however, that there might be a difference of opinion on the second
                        sentence of Paragraph 2 in the report, which indicated that steps have been
                        taken to assure that except in specific instances where U.S. interests may
                        otherwise require, no new commitments for provision of military equipment on
                        a grant basis would be offered to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                        Germany, France, Austria and Luxembourg. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA2"
                            >Herter</persName> thought some members of the Council might wish to
                        delete the “except clause” in this sentence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                            >Gray</persName> said that in all candor he was compelled to state that
                        in his view he did not think the Monday meeting of various individuals on
                        this subject<note n="3" xml:id="d254fn3">Presumably the meeting recorded in
                                <ref target="#d252">Document 252</ref>.</note> had applied the
                        “except clause” to the five countries named by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                            >Gray</persName> felt that the second sentence of Paragraph 2 had no
                        meaning when the qualification represented by the “except clause” remained
                        in the sentence. He suggested the Cyprus precedent might be followed; that
                        is, the matter might be referred to the National Security Council for
                        decision if the Department of State sometime in the future felt it was
                        necessary in the national interest to give grant military assistance to one
                        of the five countries named.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> said he wished to
                        cite a particular case which illustrated the need for flexibility in this
                        matter. Since 1957 there had been considerable discussion of second
                        generation <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s in Europe. Recently there
                        had been indications that a desirable missile might be determined upon, but
                        a difference of opinion had developed among European countries. The <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> maintained that a distribution of the
                        manufacturing of the missile would require revision of the atomic agreements
                        with Germany. Also there had been recent conversations concerning the
                        development of a land-based Polaris. If Polaris developments were
                        accelerated, perhaps some Polaris missiles could be established in Europe
                        ahead of the original time-table. Such a development, he felt, would be very
                        desirable, but the question was would the European countries agree to the
                        establishment of second generation <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s on
                        a shared-cost basis. He did not know the answer to this question, but he was
                        convinced that if the “except clause” did not remain in the second sentence
                        of Paragraph 2, we would not be able to discuss cost-sharing for second
                        generation <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s with our European <pb
                            n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0527"/>allies; we would have to insist
                        that they bear the entire cost of the new <gloss target="#t_IRBM1"
                            >IRBM</gloss>s. Flexibility in matters of this kind was all he had in
                        mind by the reservation represented by the “except clause.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFCJ1">Scribner</persName> said the language of the
                        report referred to new commitments. Accordingly, he wondered by [<hi
                            rend="italic">why</hi>?] the Department of State would be precluded from
                        discussing <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> problems with European
                        countries if the “except clause” were eliminated. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> said the establishment of new <gloss
                            target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s in Europe would be a new commitment. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFCJ1">Scribner</persName> said discussions alone
                        need not involve a commitment; he thought the matter could be brought back
                        to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> for decision after the Department
                        of State had discussed the problem with the European countries. In Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFCJ1">Scribner</persName>’s view, <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> officials in the field would feel that the
                        language of the report, if it included the “except clause”, meant
                        continuation of our old policy. He believed the language of the report as it
                        stood tended to negative [<hi rend="italic">negate</hi>?] <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 2158 because we should not be
                        doing anything unless it was in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        interest. Sometimes our officials in the field made commitments unknown to
                        Washington. He had no objection to changing the “except clause” to read
                        “except where the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decides
                        otherwise.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> thought the language
                        suggested by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFCJ1">Scribner</persName> would put
                        the Department of State in a very awkward position. He felt State was
                        entitled to some exception in the interest of flexibility. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> thought there was not too much
                        difference of opinion. As he understood it, State wanted flexibility to deal
                        with unusual situations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName>
                        pointed out that the interpretation placed on policy language by officials
                        in the field was not important since these officials could not make new
                        commitments without approval from Washington. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> thought there should be no difficulty
                        in creating a flexibility which would allow State to deal with an unusual
                        situation. He had an understanding with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> that further money would not be requested in the case
                        of the five countries mentioned. However, he felt the language in the report
                        as it stood was too broad and had been too broadly interpreted. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> said any language was
                        acceptable to him as long as it did not put the Department of State in a
                        complete strait jacket so that it would be unable to hold conversations with
                        our European allies without coming back to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> for approval. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1"
                            >Gates</persName> suggested that the “except clause” might be revised to
                        read “exceptions will be approved by the Secretaries of State and Defense.”
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> believed the decision
                        should be in the hands of the President or the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName>
                        said it would be impossible to negotiate on a theoretical basis; that is, it
                        would be impossible for the Department of State to discuss new commitments
                        if the Department did not know whether or not it could make a new
                        commitment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said he would
                        be satisfied with a Presidential <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0528"
                        />decision as to new commitments. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2"
                            >Herter</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1"
                            >Gates</persName> also said they would be satisfied with a Presidential
                        decision, although Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName>
                        added he thought the situation was being made unduly awkward. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said he was not worried about what
                        members of the Council might do but he was worried about what officials
                        several echelons down might do. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1"
                            >Gates</persName> said officials that far down could not do anything
                        without the approval of higher authority. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFCJ1"
                            >Scribner</persName> said officials in the lower echelons could hold
                        discussions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName>
                        repeated that amendment of the second sentence of Paragraph 2 to indicate
                        that the President would decide on exceptions would be satisfactory to
                        him.</p>

                    <p>I am interested in two subjects affecting our foreign operations that have

                                people in the field who gather the information for contracts for the
                                construction of dams, roads, buildings, and so forth and so forth,
                                under the aegis of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>. He thinks
                                that this contracting is done from the central office on the basis
                                of inadequate information. The result is that facilities constructed
                                are often not those that are desired by the country and in the case
                                of roads, badly located. Moreover, he believes that if we could have
                                better supervision in the field, we could eliminate criticism of
                                peculation and waste. He advocates the use of Army engineers—and I
                                must say the idea has some appeal.</item>

                                not a detailed one, but by inference I gather he was talking about a

                    <p>I should like for you or <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> to
                        have a talk with him to see what he has in mind. It is easy to say the words
                        “bold” and “new”—but this means nothing unless he has got a practical
                        program that has escaped our attention. I assume he knows we have been
                        trying to secure the cooperation of other industrial countries in the free
                        world and that we have done everything possible to stir up greater
                        cooperation and public interest in these necessary operations. However, it
                        would be interesting to know just what he is insinuating.</p>

                        the Mutual Security Program in his May 2 address, terming it “one of the
                        greatest programs through which the United States can lead toward world
                        peace.” That evening, the President gave a major speech on the program at a
                        dinner sponsored by the Committee for International Growth and the Committee
                        to Strengthen the Frontiers of Freedom. For the texts, see <hi rend="italic"

                                unavoidably fall mainly on force modernization in the military
                                assistance part of the program—and that this would mainly hit <gloss

                                administrative errors in the program. The President quickly conceded
                                that errors are bound to occur in a program of this character and
                                magnitude but that these cannot be allowed to destroy the entire
                                effort. It was pointed out to the Speaker that prior reductions have
                                not crippled the program because funds still remaining in the
                                pipeline have tided the program over the successive reductions—a
                                process no longer feasible because of the consumption of the
                                pipeline these past few years.</p>

                                get the highest possible figure for mutual security but gave no more
                                specific assurance than this, and this assertion was coupled with
                                the reiteration of the great difficulties in handling the program
                                this year.” (Memorandum for the record by <persName

                        focus on the appropriation, letting the authorization go through relatively
                        unscathed. <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0532"/>Sen. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName> added that 12 of the 27 members
                        of the Appropriations Committee would vote in favor of every possible
                        reduction in the program.</p>
                    <p>The President emphasized how the pipeline on the military side of the program
                        had been reduced from $8 billion in 1953 to $2 billion presently. The
                            <persName corresp="#p_POE1">Passman</persName> threat to reduce the
                        program by $1–1/2 billion now, when the pipeline has been so reduced, would
                        be disastrous if accomplished. The President thought that the Appropriations
                        people should pay more attention to the judgment of the authorizing
                        Committees, and he suggested that some Republican supporters of the program
                        should demand to be heard by the <persName corresp="#p_POE1"
                            >Passman</persName> Subcommittee. Sen. <persName corresp="#p_DEM1"
                            >Dirksen</persName> thought <persName corresp="#p_POE1"
                            >Passman</persName>, being irresponsible, would exploit to his own
                        advantage any attempt by Republican Senators to influence a House action.
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> thought the important
                        thing was to marshall the facts that would refute irresponsible charges of
                        waste and mismanagement. Sen. <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName>
                        thought it important to avoid on the Floor of the Senate any “psychology of
                        cutting,” for that would probably ruin any chances of subsequent
                        restorations.</p>
                    <p>The President urged an intensive effort to make a factual showing of the good
                        accomplished through the program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HBN1"
                            >Harlow</persName> noted how members of the Armed Forces Committee
                        testify before the Appropriations Committee in order to settle differences
                        and avoid fights on the House Floor, and he thought the same might be done
                        in the mutual security area. Sen. <persName corresp="#p_BS1"
                            >Bridges</persName> commented that much of the critical information is
                        supplied by mutual security employees overseas. Then he added that the
                        Senate Appropriations Committee would resent very much being told what to do
                        by another Senate Committee, particularly if it meant having to listen to
                        Sen. <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>’s crusade for the
                        scholarship program which happened to bear his name when really it should be
                        known as “American Scholarships.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                            >Halleck</persName> also set forth reasons for independent judgment by
                        Appropriations people, especially since the various legislative committees
                        tend to become promoters of special interests.</p>
                    <p>Rep. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Halleck</persName> and Sen. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> both endeavored to reassure the
                        President that the program was in better shape than he expected. The
                        President commented on how much the various candidates would dislike being
                        called back to a special session this election year.<note n="3"

                    <p>On May 12, the House of Representatives and the Senate approved a compromise
                        version of legislation authorizing Mutual Security appropriations for fiscal
                        year 1961. H.R. 11510 thus became Public Law 86–472, the Mutual Security Act
                        of 1960. For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current
                            Documents, 1960,</hi> pages 841–852. President <persName

                        declaring it contained “essentially all of the requests I have put forward

                    <p>Eisenhower sent his own message to 15 key Republican and Democratic
                        representatives on June 11, prior to his June 12 departure on a trip to the

                                Appropriations Committee has acted to cut the military assistance
                                appropriation request by four hundred million dollars and defense
                                support by an additional seventy-five million dollars. This cannot

                                Unavoidably the military assistance cut would have to fall heavily
                                upon force modernization. This would compel America to withhold from

                    <p>The House Appropriations Committee reported the Mutual Security
                        appropriations legislation, H.R. 12619, June 13, cutting $790.5 million from
                        the President’s request. (H. Rept. 1798, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second
                        Session) During a noon telephone conversation the following day, Acting
                        Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> informed
                        Secretary of Defense Gates he “was getting ready to put out quite a blast on

                            corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> said he had one in preparation also.
                        CDD said he just wanted to let him know we are really going to town on this
                        and that Defense would not be alone.” (Notes of telephone conversation;

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s June 15 statement described
                        the committee’s action as “a matter of grave concern” which would “severely
                        impair the effectiveness” of the Mutual Security Program and would “require
                        the assumption of risks to our national security which are both unnecessary
                        and dangerous.” It outlined the impact specific cuts would have and
                        described <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0534"/>how several amendments
                        would affect the program. “In short,” he concluded, “the committee majority
                        proposes insufficient funds and hamstrings these. The Department is
                        profoundly convinced that correction of these defects is essential to the

                    <p>With respect to the particular suggestion of Ambassador Byroade that the Army

                        has on a number of occasions utilized the services of the Corps. It does
                        believe that an interagency agreement covering the provision of services by
                        the Corps and other agencies of the Department of Defense would clarify and
                        facilitate opportunities for more extensive reliance on the Corps.
                        Discussions looking to such an agreement will be initiated shortly by <gloss

                        expected to result in an interagency agreement under which the facilities
                        and expertise of the Corps, as well as the Bureau of Yards and Docks and
                        other technical services of the Military Establishment, could be drawn upon
                        more expeditiously and effectively in carrying out <gloss target="#t_ICA1"

                    <p>It is of the utmost importance that the American public be kept fully and
                        accurately informed regarding our military and economic assistance programs.
                        The future success of these programs depends in large part upon the extent
                        to which they are understood and supported by the American people.</p>
                    <p>At present, the great accomplishments of these programs and their vital role
                        in the attainment of our foreign policy objectives are not sufficiently
                        understood, while exaggerated or groundless criticisms are often widely
                        circulated. Much of this public misunderstanding is undoubtedly traceable to
                        the fact that adequate information about the programs is not available to
                        our people.</p>
                    <p>I am aware of the legal inhibition against utilizing assistance funds for
                        “general propaganda in support of the mutual security program.” I am
                        advised, however, that the legislative history of this enactment, supported
                        especially by recent statements of influential Congressional Committees,
                        makes it clear that the prohibition was intended to be narrowly construed.
                        Further, such Committees during the last session of the Congress urged that
                        fuller information about the programs be made available to the public.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, you are requested to consult with the Secretary of Defense in
                        the development of coordinated plans and to allocate at once sufficient
                        funds and personnel to keep the American public fully and fairly informed on
                        a continuing basis about the personnel, operations, accomplishments and
                        problems of the assistance programs. This task should be accomplished by a
                        balanced reporting of the facts, <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0536"
                        />utilizing all appropriate means or media of communications. Criticisms of
                        the programs should be fully, promptly and frankly answered. If they are
                        valid, this should be recognized. The purpose should be to place before the
                        public all of the facts.</p>

                        called on the <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0537"/>Under Secretary of
                        State to summarize the State-Defense report on the subject transmitted by
                        the reference memorandum of July 20, 1960.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> recalled a report to
                        the Council on this subject dated February 17 which indicated that steps had
                        been taken to assure that, except in specific instances where the President
                        may determine that U.S. interests otherwise require, no new commitments for
                        the provision of military equipment on a grant basis would be offered to the
                        U.K., West Germany, France, Austria, and Luxembourg. The report before the
                        Council today covered five countries not covered in the previous report,
                        namely, the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, and Japan. These five
                        countries had been certified by the Treasury Department as financially able
                        to pay for military assistance. The situation in these five countries had
                        been studied after an evaluation of the plans of the country teams.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he was not
                        suggesting that decision be made at the present time as to the long-term
                        prospects for military assistance for these countries. He proposed to report
                        to the Council in September on the Mutual Security Program resulting from
                        the planning exercise which had involved the country teams. At that time he
                        expected a decision on the general order of magnitude of the extent to which
                        these five countries would be included in future long-range military
                        assistance programs. However, a decision was needed now on <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 funds for these countries. All five
                        countries had been included in the illustrative presentations to Congress
                        but funds for them had not been released. It was now necessary to make a
                        decision as to the use of the funds.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the financial capabilities of the five countries, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he had examined the present and
                        prospective financial position of each country and had concluded that the
                        foreign exchange and reserve position of each country was not an obstacle to
                        its paying for its military equipment. In each case the reason for military
                        assistance was the country’s domestic budget in relation to its total
                        national resources. All five countries were planning an increase in the
                        proportion of resources devoted to defense and we were trying to induce them
                        to make this proposed increase larger. Even though such increases take
                        place, however, these countries would not be able to reach their force
                        goals. The Joint Chiefs of Staff had established strategic force objectives
                        identical with <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70 requirements, except
                        that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> objectives are higher in naval
                        requirements, because of the greater anti-submarine need as seen by the
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. None of the five countries would be
                        able to achieve the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> objectives even
                        after annual defense increases, assumed to be 7 per cent for Belgium, 6 per
                        cent for Italy, 5 per cent for the Netherlands, 4 per cent for Portugal, and
                        11 per cent for Japan. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> felt that these increases were within the range of
                        possibility and that the countries concerned might even do <pb n="506"
                            xml:id="pg_506" facs="0538"/>better, but in any case there would be
                        defense deficits ranging from $1.6 billion in the case of Italy on down.
                        These five countries could not achieve the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> force objectives from their own resources. Consequently,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought the U.S. would
                        either have to provide military assistance or change the force objectives.
                        The study on the Future of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> may lead us
                        to propose some changes in the force objectives but these objectives cannot
                        be changed unilaterally at the present time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> asked how the U.S. could
                        fill the defense gap of these five countries to the extent it was in our
                        interest to do so. He believed the answer did not lie in cutting off grant
                        military assistance. Such an action on our part would decrease rather that
                        increase the defense efforts of these countries and would lead them to feel
                        they are not regarded as important. Moreover, there was some conflict
                        between our desire to redeploy our own forces from Europe and our desire to
                        eliminate military assistance. It would be more feasible to redeploy U.S.
                        forces from Europe if indigenous forces were first built up by military
                        assistance. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> felt
                        that five years from now these five countries would be able to carry the
                        current rate of military buildup plus replacement costs. There would,
                        however, still be deficits in meeting the strategic force objectives. Cost
                        sharing was very important in getting these countries to increase their
                        military expenditures.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that this year about
                        $181 million worth of military equipment was involved in the case of these
                        five countries. It was true that the military program for the five countries
                        was larger but this program included F–104s and a multilateral program
                        already approved as well as missiles in Belgium and Jupiter in Italy. In the
                        case of Belgium, less than $2 million in spare parts and electronic
                        equipment is involved aside from the F–104s. In view of this small amount
                        and the situation of Belgium, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> felt it would be most inopportune to refuse to
                        continue military assistance to Belgium.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> believed Portugal
                        should not be considered capable of paying for the kind of new military
                        equipment it needed. Portugal was really an underdeveloped country with a
                            <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> of $236 per capita. This was less
                        than the per capita <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> for Greece and Japan
                        and only Turkey had a lower <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Portugal was run by a dictatorship with
                        which financial stability was axiomatic. Although Portugal was well off in
                        reserves, it did not have the budgetary capacity to buy modern military
                        equipment. We could not expect Portugal to do more than it was doing at the
                        present time. A total of about $17 million was involved in military
                        assistance to Portugal. Such assistance is related to the Azores base which
                        is important to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Japan about $25 million worth of equipment is involved,
                        primarily excess F–86Ds, Nikes, other guided missiles and destroyers. The
                        assistance we provide to Japan has a close relation to <pb n="507"
                            xml:id="pg_507" facs="0539"/>our own forces since the build-up of
                        Japanese forces will enable Japan to undertake missions now performed by
                        U.S. forces. In view of the Japanese popular reaction to the ratification of
                        the Mutual Security Treaty, the Japanese feeling with respect to bases, and
                        the fact that the amount involved is not large, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> felt we should proceed with the $25
                        million program for Japan.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Italy, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        continued, $90 million worth of new matériel was involved, including
                        improvements in Italian air forces, modernization of the army, and Terrier
                        and Tartar missile systems on ships being built by the Italians. Italy was
                        very well off so far as foreign exchange was concerned but the country’s per
                        capita income was only $572 in 1959, the lowest of any country in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> except for Portugal. With this low per
                        capita income, Italy has defense expenditures amounting to 3.8 per cent of
                        its <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. Eventually Italy will be able to
                        increase its defense expenditures even though it has the problem of
                        depressed areas in southern Italy and has tax rates probably equivalent to
                        those in the U.S. Italy has certainly cooperated with the U.S.; it welcomed
                        the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> despite its large communist and
                        socialist parties. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> felt it
                        was necessary to continue helping the Italians with military assistance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> reported that the
                        Netherlands had a <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> of $900 per capita,
                        the lowest figure of any country in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        except Italy and Portugal. The Netherlands also had a heavy public debt
                        amounting to 48 per cent of the <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. The
                        Netherlands tax rate was high, even higher than the tax rate in Italy,
                        amounting to about 29 per cent against 25 per cent for the U.S. (Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that in
                        speaking of tax rates, he had made adjustments to take account of social
                        insurance charges in the European countries and agricultural surplus and
                        local government expenditures in the U.S.) The Netherlands was devoting 4.5
                        per cent of its national income to defense and was planning to increase this
                        figure to 5 per cent over the next few years, compared with a figure of 9
                        per cent for the U.S. The Netherlands had been exemplary in living up to its
                        commitments. The military assistance program for the Netherlands this year
                        included aircraft for antisubmarine warfare, other aircraft improvements,
                        Nike, Terrier (cost-shared) and Sergeant missile systems.</p>
                    <p>Concluding his presentation, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> recommended that the Council note the State-Defense
                        report, agree upon the desirability of maintaining pressure on these five
                        countries to continue increasing their contribution to the defense effort in

                        2158 might be achieved, and approve proceeding in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1961 with the programs of military assistance to these
                        countries substantially as presented to and endorsed by the Congress,

                        the total military assistance appropriations. Any curtailment in military
                            <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0540"/>assistance programs for

                        appropriated would have unfavorable political effects. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that in about six weeks he
                        would be ready to present the Mutual Security Program for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962. At that time he anticipated there would
                        be a full discussion of military assistance for these countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that the Secretary
                        of the Treasury’s determination that the five countries were financially
                        able to pay for their military equipment had been based on strictly
                        financial considerations. He asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> whether he wished to comment.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> first complimented
                        the President on the speech to the Republican National Convention.<note

                                1960–61</hi>, pp. 589–601.</note> He then said he was concerned
                        about our future military assistance programs. We seemed to go through the
                        cycle of formulating planning figures, then presenting such figures to other
                        governments and to Congress, then formulating expenditure proposals. The
                        first two steps, that is, planning figures and presentations, were said not
                        to be very important but suddenly we reach the expenditure proposal stage of
                        the cycle and this stage was presumably very important. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> pointed out that Western Europe
                        had made great strides recently. Western European countries and Japan as
                        well had increased their foreign exchange holdings while the U.S. was the
                        one country whose foreign exchange holdings had declined. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> believed that each of
                        these five countries devoted a smaller proportion of its <gloss
                            target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> to defense than did the U.S. Similarly, he
                        believed no country devoted as large a share of its national budget to
                        defense as did the U.S. Taking into account all measures of aid to the five
                        countries, one would have to conclude that our aid to them had gone up.
                        Regional aid, in which these countries participated, was involved in this
                        conclusion. The Joint Chiefs of Staff had devised strategic objectives for
                        these countries which were higher than the <gloss target="#t_MC1"
                        >MC</gloss>–70 requirements. With respect to the capability of countries to
                        meet budgetary requirements, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> wished to point to the position of the U.S. If we
                        were to assure the stability of our currency, render assistance to
                        underdeveloped countries (including $600 million to Latin America) and then
                        provide military assistance to Europe until the European standard of living
                        equals ours, we would find that we had created a world quite different from
                        that in which we live today. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> felt such a course of action is impossible for the
                        U.S. Due to the failure of Congress to enact various revenue measures
                        proposed by the Administration, government revenues are about to suffer a
                        decrease. Large assistance programs to Latin America, to the Congo, and to
                        other parts of Africa are just beginning. Secretary <pb n="509"
                            xml:id="pg_509" facs="0541"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> felt the U.S. would soon be
                        faced with the problem of a large budgetary deficit. He also felt that the
                        taxes of the five countries included in the State-Defense report were less
                        than the taxes collected in the U.S., if proper adjustments were made in the
                        tax rates of the various countries. The U.S. would also have a tremendous
                        agricultural surplus problem in the near future since the wheat crop was far
                        above normal. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had
                        recently been talking to European bankers who had told him that they were
                        concerned lest the U.S. should attempt actions beyond its financial
                        capacity. He felt the time had come when we must begin to say, this year,
                        that building Polaris, Atlas, and a strategic striking force, and providing
                        assistance to underdeveloped countries, is more important than grant
                        military assistance to Europe, even though we are committed to such
                        assistance. Such a policy, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> concluded, was in his opinion simply good judgment;
                        he knew it made good fiscal sense.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> asked to what extent
                        the balance of payments was a factor in grant military assistance to the
                        European countries. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said it would be helpful if these countries
                        purchased their military equipment. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2"
                            >Herter</persName> said he had assumed that from the military point of
                        view the items provided the European countries by our assistance were very
                        important. He doubted that it would be possible either to put pressure on
                        these countries to buy their own equipment or to let them go without the
                        equipment. The immediate issue seemed to be whether or not to secure the
                        release of funds approved by Congress. He asked whether he had been correct
                        in understanding Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        to say that other things were more important than military assistance to
                        Europe. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> replied
                        that in his view we could not continue to have the kind of economy we now
                        have and continue on with activities we are now engaged in. We must face up
                        to the necessity of making choices between various policies. In his opinion
                        Latin American assistance was more important than military assistance to
                        Europe. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> thought that
                        the money for military assistance to the five European countries had already
                        been requested and appropriated by the Congress. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that at a meeting of certain
                        members of the Council last fall,<note n="4" xml:id="d261fn4">Not further
                            identified.</note> it had been agreed that the Administration would
                        request funds from Congress for military assistance to these countries but
                        would not spend it. We seem now to be at the point of deciding to spend such
                        money. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> believed we
                        could not afford to continue our program of give-away assistance. He thought
                        the lives of the Europeans were important to them as well as to us.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (121/2 lines of source text) not

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> noted that the increase in
                        the gold reserves of the five countries included in the State-Defense report
                        was almost equal to the decline in U.S. gold reserves. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that the increase in the gold
                        reserves of these countries was equivalent to our loss of gold plus all the
                        newly-mined gold during the period of such loss.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> asked whether Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> was suggesting that the
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 military assistance program to
                        the five countries not be carried out. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said this was his suggestion [<hi rend="italic">1
                            line of source text not declassified</hi>]. He felt that each country
                        should be told that we could not carry out this military assistance program.
                        The President said the European countries should be making greater efforts
                        to provide for their own defense. In part we are supporting their defenses
                        through our retaliatory capabilities, through our navy, and through our air
                        force. In addition to all that, we are providing military assistance.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that last
                        fall there had been a feeling that <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70
                        requirements should be reviewed because they might be too high. Now
                        strategic objectives for these five countries were greater than the <gloss
                            target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70 requirements. If we had to assist the five
                        countries to achieve their strategic force objectives, we would be unable to
                        build a road system in this country and we might have to raise taxes. If a
                        large budgetary deficit occurred in the U.S., what had already happened to
                        our gold reserves would be insignificant compared to what would happen in
                        the future. World financial stability would be destroyed. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> emphasized once more
                        that governmental revenues would decrease as a result of the failure of
                        Congress to pass certain proposed legislation. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> said that a study by the Bureau of
                        the Budget indicated that the actions of Congress had either decreased
                        revenues or increased expenditures by $1.6 billion and that pending
                        legislation would add $2.4 billion to this figure.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that if the
                        House appropriations were not increased by the Senate, a $200 million
                        reduction in force improvement would result. The cost of maintenance would
                        be $1.2 billion, leaving $200 million for force improvement. These figures
                        were subject to adjustment in light of actual appropriations and would
                        probably be less. Last year’s inadequate appropriations caused a curtailment
                        of the program and resulted in our asking for increased appropriations this
                        year. There is talk of a 25 per cent reduction for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1961.</p>
                    <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that
                        the President had to leave the meeting at 4:15 for another engagement. He
                        suggested the item under discussion be disposed of as rapidly as possible in
                        order that the Council might proceed to the discussion of U.S. policy toward
                        the Congo. Ambassador Timberlake was awaiting the Congo discussion.</p>
                    <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0543"/>
                    <p>The President said grant military assistance was a difficult problem. His
                        feelings were those of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> but he believed we had got ourselves committed to
                        such an extent that we could not completely eliminate military assistance at
                        this time. He had been struggling with this question for fourteen years.
                        During all this time he had said that military assistance to Europe is an
                        emergency measure designed to restore Europe militarily in the same way that
                        the Marshall Plan restored Europe economically. However, all the Europeans
                        are carefully watching the debates in Congress; they will know how much
                        Congress authorizes to the nickel and will say we are running out on them if
                        we propose to give them less. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> felt that a full debate on the future of military
                        assistance should take place when the Council took up the Mutual Security
                        Program for 1962.</p>
                    <p>The President believed we ought to inform the European governments that
                        military assistance on the present scale will have to be discontinued after
                        this year. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he
                        would not worry too much about the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961
                        military assistance program if the European governments could be told they
                        would not receive any grant military assistance after <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1961. Mr. <persName>Douglas</persName><note n="5"
                            xml:id="d261fn5">James H. Douglas, Deputy Secretary of Defense.</note>
                        said some parts of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 program were
                        subject to review. The President said that if Congress did not provide as
                        much money as was requested, we would have to carry out absolutely essential
                        activities and proportionately reduce other activities.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        said that if the total military assistance appropriations were reduced by
                        Congress, it would probably be necessary to reduce the large Italian and
                        Netherlands programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> suggested that the five
                        governments should be told that they cannot continue to look forward in the
                        future to the same level of military assistance they have received in the
                        past. The President agreed, adding that we need not give all the reasons for
                        this policy. He felt it was high time that such action was taken. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> believed this action would
                        meet one of the principal Treasury-Budget objections to the State-Defense
                        report. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> felt the
                        European governments should also be informed that if military assistance
                        funds are reduced by Congress, military assistance programs will have to be
                        cut. The President believed the European governments should be told that in
                        the future our military assistance programs would be reduced, not increased.
                        He added that we had made great efforts to bring Germany into European
                        defense activities but no one had been slower than Germany in meeting
                        commitments.</p>

                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, of the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1962–66 Military Assistance Plans,<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d262fn1">Not found.</note> which had been submitted by the
                        Unified Commanders and reviewed by the Departments of State and Defense, and
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary stated that he was prepared to approve the Plans for all
                        countries except Greece, and to have them used by the field as the basis for
                        preparation of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 Military
                        Assistance program and for MAP planning. He was deferring approval of the
                        Greek Plan for a few weeks pending receipt of further information from the
                        Athens Country Team relating to the large shortfall which the Plan projects
                        in resources available to finance the Greek military effort. The Defense
                        representatives agreed that the Greek Plan presented the most serious
                        problem in this regard and merited further consideration. It was agreed that
                        a State/Defense message should be dispatched to Athens on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that, with approval
                        of the 5-year Plans, the annual MAP programs would continue to be reviewed
                        and approved by the <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> Coordinator. He also
                        noted that, as submitted to Washington, the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1962–66 Plans were in varying degree deficient in describing
                        the shortfalls in the attainment of U.S. security objectives and that this
                        should be corrected when the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963–67 Plans
                        are prepared.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that, in approving the
                        Iranian Plan, he wanted the Tehran Country Team to re-appraise and report on
                        the complex political and economic requirements which must be weighed in
                        projecting military assistance to Iran. Also, while approving the Plans for
                        Vietnam and Laos, he wanted to establish a special group to review all <pb
                            n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0546"/><gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>
                        programs in these countries against the totality of U.S. objectives in them;
                        significant revisions in these plans might be required based upon the
                        findings and recommendations of the group. Mr. <persName>Kuss</persName>
                        expressed the hope that the group would not “go over the same old ground”
                        and that the result of such an examination would apply to the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963–67 Plans rather than to <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962–66; this was agreed.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out, with respect to the “FINABIL” statistics shown in the
                        5-year Plans, that these figures were included as a matter of information
                        and that approval of the Plans by the Department of State should not be
                        interpreted as validating or approving this statistical analysis.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the special report to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        on the significant points revealed through the new planning procedure, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> asked for the assistance
                        of the Defense Department in the preparation of the report, of which he
                        would like a draft to review by mid-August. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJO1"
                            >Bell</persName> said that he felt that such a presentation would be
                        useful for two purposes: (a) to give the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                        >NSC</gloss>, for the first time, a meaningful exposé of “what U.S. security
                        policy costs and what the U.S. can afford, globally”, i.e., a confrontation
                        of “security policy” vs. “budgetary policy”, and (b) if the presentation is
                        done well, it will provide the best possible grounds upon which to base the
                        budget request for the Military Assistance program for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 and subsequent years. Mr.
                            <persName>Kuss</persName> said that the Defense Department agreed as to
                        the desirability of such a presentation, but did not wish to be placed in a
                        situation where the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> expects to receive a
                        report every year following approval of the Plans and would therefore prefer
                        to retain flexibility as to the manner of reporting to the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and the nature of the problems or issues to
                        be brought to the attention of the Council and the President. He felt that
                        the essential need this year was to utilize the Plans as the grounds for the
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 budgetary request. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BJO1">Bell</persName> agreed with this thesis. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> suggested the possibility of the
                        report being submitted in September, when the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1962 budget request is being formulated. [The Under
                        Secretary subsequently asked that the report be ready in draft form by
                        August 15 for review and early presentation to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then turned to a question
                        on the Italian Plan, in the light of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            2158.<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">Regarding <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> Action No. 2158, see <ref target="#d250fn13">footnote
                                13, Document 250</ref>.</note> He felt that the Plan’s projection of
                        the Italian defense effort over the period was too low in view of the
                        recorded State/Defense intention to exert pressure on the Italians to make
                        an increased effort; the Rome Country Team should be asked whether it is not
                        reasonable to project an Italian defense effort with increases approaching 8
                        per cent per year as an initial target in discussions with <pb n="515"
                            xml:id="pg_515" facs="0547"/>the Italians. He pointed out that the
                        present 4 per cent constitutes merely an increase comparable to the
                        projected increase in per capita <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Japanese Plan and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        2158, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> asked whether the
                        military assistance being planned was not intended solely to create a
                        Japanese ability to assume military tasks presently being performed by U.S.
                        forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said that
                        generally speaking, yes. Mr. <persName>Kuss</persName> noted that Defense
                        had so far not been successful in eliciting a <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> statement that the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                        would be able to withdraw from Japan when the Japanese air force reaches a
                        specified capability, and that this probably is because the missions of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> in Japan encompass more than a
                        defense of the Japanese islands.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> asked the Defense
                        representatives for the reason behind the significant increase in the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> force goals for Portugal in the ASW field,
                        again in light of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 2158; was this because
                        of the withdrawal of the French fleet from <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said
                        that Defense would provide a quick answer on this point. Those present
                        surmised that the increase was the reflection of SACLANT’s estimate of his
                        current requirements in the eastern Atlantic.</p>
                    <p>The meeting concluded with an exchange of complimentary remarks concerning
                        the degree of cooperation between State and Defense staffs in the course of

                    <p>At noon August 8, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                        recorded a message for broadcast on national radio and television in which
                        he commented on the reconvening of Congress and outlined tasks requiring
                        legislative action before the end of the year. Among these were the Mutual
                        Security appropriations: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Our national security needs encompass more than excellence and
                                strength in our own military establishment. They include measures to
                                build free world strength everywhere. These require, and I therefore
                                request, appropriations of the full amount authorized by the
                                Congress for the Mutual Security Program. At this point in the
                                legislative process, these appropriations have been cut by well over
                                a half billion dollars. The Nation’s security and our inescapable
                                interest in a stable world require that these amounts be
                                restored.”</p>

                    <p>The President also announced that he was requesting an increase in the Mutual
                        Security contingency fund in order to meet unexpected crises, such as unrest
                        in the Congo. For text of his statement, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers

                    <p>[Here follow a list of participants, brief opening remarks by the President,
                        and discussion of unrelated topics.]</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mutual Security</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DEM1"
                            >Dirksen</persName> said he thought the Mutual Security Contingency Fund
                        increase would be ready for Friday the 19th, but that there would probably
                        be an added title containing a miscellaneous catch-all. Sen. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName> was persuaded that the Senate
                        would get to the mutual security program on Friday but said they did not
                        have the authorization for the $100 million contingency fund and asked if
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HBN1">Harlow</persName> could provide this.
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> said he hoped the
                        President would not be disturbed if there were an amendment proposed to the
                        Mutual Security Bill giving aid to Communist countries—that this might be
                        proposed, not with the intent of being passed, but to see how Senators
                        Johnson and <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> vote.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d264fn2"><persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and
                            Johnson were, respectively, the Democratic Party’s nominees for
                            President and Vice President.</note> The President suggested talking
                        with Sec. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> about this. He would
                        be quite willing to embarrass the Democrats but did not wish at the same
                        time to run the risk of embarrassing ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> said he would like to
                        see such an amendment, making some reference to the Monroe Doctrine. The
                        President responded that the Monroe Doctrine does not apply in the case of
                        Cuba; <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0549"/>it does not apply until the
                        state in question becomes a vassal of Moscow; as long as the country is
                        still independent, the Doctrine does not apply. Sen. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> proposed consideration of the idea
                        of adding an amendment denying military aid to Cuba. Sen. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName>’s opinion was the <persName
                            corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> amendment would go through if the
                        State Department did not resist—that it was an Administration problem. The
                        President said that we have been doing our best to break Poland away from
                        Moscow and that we have witnessed in that country a somewhat greater freedom
                        of expression. We do, he said, a little here and a little there, as we
                        can—just as, if you possibly knew how, you would break up the Sino-Soviet
                        axis. But at all events, he said, our policy is to break these various
                        alliances apart. Sen. <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> did not
                        know what Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> might do,
                        but he seemed to be going soft on China, on Asia all the way around. Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName>’ thought was that while
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> has to vote, to be on
                        record, he should be made to go on record. Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> thought it would be difficult for
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. But the State
                        Department, he felt, was very little politically inclined. The President
                        again urged that the whole question be taken up with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName> inquired why it might
                        not be desirable to have a modern interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine to
                        fit the present circumstances. In reply, the President pointed out the
                        problem of solidarity of the hemisphere. Our neighbors, he said, resist the
                        unilateral nature of the Monroe Doctrine. That is what we have been trying
                        to get at in the Caracas Declaration, the Rio Conference, and other
                        meetings—to create the willingness to resist Communist penetration in this
                        hemisphere, if with <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> help there is trouble in
                        one of the Pan-American countries. He emphasized the imperative need of
                        keeping our neighbors “thinking our way”. And, the President continued, we
                        are showing great promise. Mexico and others are coming around, seeing the
                        danger. If we were to try to accomplish our aims by force, we would see all
                        of these countries tending to fall away and some would be communist within
                        two years. Many of them are afraid of the Castro influence in their own
                        countries. They keep saying that the influence is waning, but they have got
                        to wait and let it happen. The Vice President pointed out that not
                        everything is bad in Cuba, that now for the first time we are seeing a
                        significant change among the people: they don’t like what’s happening. This
                        is beginning to become the sentiment of the professional people and the
                        peasants. Castro is obviously in very great difficulty, and other countries
                        are coming around to see the true situation. The problem is that Castro is
                        in charge in Cuba, not the Communists, as it appears. Things might, however,
                        get so bad that the Communists would have to make an overt move; then we
                        would have them.</p>
                    <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0550"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hoeven</persName> reported the concern over Cuba that he had
                        been made aware of in the mid-west. He said people are asking why don’t we
                        do something. A Republican candidate from the Senate is recommending a
                        blockade, claiming that parts for missile bases are being smuggled into
                        Cuba. The President reiterated his caution that if the United States does
                        not conduct itself in precisely the right way vis-à-vis Cuba, we could lose
                        all of South America. The Vice President’s opinion was that the argument is
                        really one over timing. The President has stated, he said, that we will not
                        tolerate a Communist government in Cuba. But the question is what we do
                        meanwhile and when we do it.</p>
                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> asked what the answer was
                        to the Laos situation. We have provided hundreds of millions of dollars to
                        Laos, and now what have we to show for it? The President replied that Laos
                        has always been neutralist, that it has to be so. He invited attention to
                        the fact, however, that the Laotians had not deposed their king. Sen.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> commented that it would be
                        helpful if the Congress could have an answer on Laos from Sec. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> before Friday.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d264fn3">August 19.</note></p>
                    <p>In the Mutual Security effort, the President said, you lose some countries,
                        you make some mistakes. But, he said, in the over-all look at the good we
                        have done. He acknowledged that he was worried over Central Africa. He had
                        concluded that the reason the Central Africans wanted independence was that
                        they wanted a vote in the United Nations; otherwise, they wouldn’t leave
                        France. Our own people, he continued, are gradually getting the idea that
                        what happens elsewhere in the world affects us. He cited Japan as an
                        example, saying that he had received all kinds of apologies from Japanese
                        and that a Japanese University wants to give him an honorary degree in
                        absentia as a kind of recompense for the treatment he had received. The Vice
                        President agreed, saying that we should note what is happening in Japan now:
                        they are stoning the Communists. He thought perhaps Japan is even more
                        strongly anti-Communist now than they would have been if the President had
                        been able to make his trip there.</p>

                    <p>The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the Mutual Security
                        appropriations bill, H.R. 12619, on August 19. Although the bill provided
                        $270 million less than President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName>’s total Mutual Security request, including his
                        August 8 petition, the committee in effect restored nearly all funds cut by
                        the House of Representatives, except $200 million cut from the Military
                        Assistance Program. It also removed most of the restrictions the House had
                        placed on spending the appropriation. (S. Rept. 1849, Eighty-sixth Congress,
                        Second Session)</p>
                    <p>After brief debate, the Senate passed H.R. 12619 on August 24. House and
                        Senate conferees reported a compromise version of the bill the following
                        day, cutting $534 million from the President’s request and restoring some of
                        the earlier House restrictions. (H. Rept. 2164, Eighty-sixth Congress,
                        Second Session) On August 26, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> released a statement declaring he was “gravely
                        concerned by the conference action.” Failure to restore the funds would
                        impede whoever succeeded him as President: “He, no less than I, must have
                        adequate funds to do the job.” (<hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
                            Current Documents, 1960,</hi> pages 857–858) The President also sent

                        Minority Leader <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName>, Speaker of

                    <p>Nevertheless, the House and the Senate approved the bill August 26. H.R.
                        12619 thus became P.L. 86–704, the Mutual Security and Related Agencies
                        Appropriation Act, 1961, which appropriated $3,716,350,000 for the Mutual
                        Security Program. Eisenhower signed P.L. 86–704 on September 2. For text,

                        reported a catch-all spending bill for fiscal year 1961, H.R. 13161 (H.
                        Rept. 2166, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session), which the House passed
                        with amendments that day. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported H.R.
                        13161 on August 27, having added $190 million for the Mutual Security
                        Program and having recommended alteration of a section of P.L. 86–704 which
                        restricted expenditure of certain Mutual Security funds. (S. Rept. 1925,
                        Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session)</p>
                    <p>The Senate passed H.R. 13161 with amendments August 29; House and Senate
                        conferees reported a compromise version of the bill August 30. The
                        conference report disagreed on the additional $190 million for the Mutual
                        Security Program. (H. Rept. 2211, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session) On
                        August 31, the Senate and House <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0552"
                        />agreed to the conference report by voice votes. The House, however,
                        accepted only the Senate amendment adding $65 million for Defense support,
                        and the Senate concurred. H.R. 13161 thus became P.L. 86–722, Second
                        Supplemental Appropriation Act, 1961, which President <persName

                        1961.</p>
                    <p>On September 17, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HCA2"
                            >Herter</persName> reported to the President on the institution of a
                        Mutual Security information program. In accordance with the President’s
                        instructions, the Department of State had established a position for a
                        Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs who would create and implement
                        “a program to build public understanding of the Mutual Security Program;”
                        created positions for four Regional Information Specialists in the field who
                        would provide Washington with factual material on accomplishments of the
                        Mutual Security Program, which in turn would be passed on to the media;
                        coordinated Department of Defense, U.S. Information Agency, International
                        Cooperation Administration, and other agency participation in this public
                        information program; and started providing information about the Mutual

                        problem of NSC Action 2275. He noted that military assistance problems were
                        co-mingled with problems of U.S. military programs, the U.S. Budget and the
                        balance-of-payments, and strategic, economic and political considerations.

                        on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> briefly reviewed the
                        history of the establishment of the <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1"
                            >Draper</persName> Committee which was created, he said, as a result of
                        a recommendation by the Secretaries of State and Defense to the President in
                        the fall of 1958. The Committee was requested to re-examine the purposes of
                        the military assistance program. One objective of this re-examination was to
                        counter a tendency toward indiscriminate Congressional cuts in the program.
                        Among the recommendations of the <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1"
                            >Draper</persName> Committee which were approved in principle by the
                        President were the following: (a) that long-term plans for military
                        assistance should be developed; (b) that order-of-magnitude dollar
                        guidelines should be provided to the planners to assure feasibility of the
                        plans which they developed; (c) that military assistance planning should be
                        decentralized to the field; and (d) that guidance provided to the planners
                        should be as specific as possible and should be based upon and implement
                        national security policy objectives and guidance.</p>

                    <p>As a first step in the implementation of the <persName corresp="#p_DGWH1"
                            >Draper</persName> Committee recommendations, mutual security operations
                        plans (MSOPs) had been developed for each country receiving assistance.<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d266fn4">Not found.</note> The objectives for these plans
                        were taken, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        indicated, from approved national security policies. In recognition of the
                        close relationship of economic, political and military objectives, all such
                        objectives which were susceptible of being achieved through the military
                        assistance program were included in the MSOPs. The MSOPs provided more
                        detailed guidance to the planners in the field than they had previously. The
                        decentralization of decisions on military assistance planning put a premium
                        on clear and precise instructions to the field and upon focussing
                        responsibility in the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>s, the U.S.
                        operations missions, and the unified commanders. To this end the Department
                        of Defense had revised its instructions and manuals.</p>
                    <p>The field was also given order-of-magnitude dollar guidance for planning
                        purposes. These guidelines were not regarded as binding but simply as trial
                        financial yardsticks to be used in measuring the extent to which objectives
                        set forth in the MSOPs could be met. These financial guidelines were
                        realistic and tight enough to force decisions. The field was also requested
                        to estimate each country’s contribution to its own defense on the assumption
                        that we would continue to press for increased defense expenditures where a
                        country was falling behind. The field was also asked to identify significant
                        short-falls. The field submitted its estimates to Washington for review
                        early last summer. Finally, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> reminded the Council of the decisions at Newport last
                        summer, including the agreement that the Council would make a further review
                        of the programs for the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, and Japan in connection
                        with this presentation of the five-year military assistance plan. He stated
                        that instructions had been given to U.S. Ambassadors pursuant to <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action 22754 but that this advice was not
                        to be given to the countries concerned until we presented our <gloss

                            Administration Subseries)</note></p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName>’s
                        presentation, General Lemnitzer amplified the views of the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff on the subject. He stated that the Joint Chiefs wholeheartedly
                        supported long-range military assistance planning. The need for such
                        planning had long existed and Congressional opponents had often criticized
                        the military assistance program because it was not based on such long-term
                        planning. He did not predict, however, that the same opposition would not be
                            <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0555"/>critical of the planning itself
                        if it were submitted to Congress. He noted that the Joint Chiefs had
                        participated in and made a thorough review of the plans. He went on to point
                        out that force goals for other countries were related to our own plans and
                        force goals. Therefore, the development of a long-term plan for military
                        assistance permitted the military services to better inter-relate military
                        assistance with U.S. plans and procurement. Such inter-relationship was
                        important because the items supplied under the military assistance program
                        could no longer be obtained off the shelf; procurement lead time had become
                        important.</p>
                    <p>Training for foreign military forces was, General Lemnitzer suggested, one of
                        the most important things that we did. Such training had not only a military
                        value but also an important value in getting across the principles of the
                        American way of life. Orientation tours for high-level military officers
                        were especially important and should be expanded and emphasized. General
                        Lemnitzer went on to suggest that we should exploit the principle of
                        cost-sharing. We should continue to seek ways to increase the contributions
                        of those countries which were able to pay. Cost-sharing did not necessarily
                        mean equal sharing by the U.S. and the country concerned. Our program in
                        Japan was a good example of what could be done through the cost-sharing
                        technique.</p>
                    <p>General Lemnitzer emphasized that our plans should be worldwide in character
                        and that we should not let the needs of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> detract from the needs of other areas of the world.
                        Military assistance was already important in Asia and might become
                        increasingly important in the Middle East. There were also emerging problems
                        in Africa and Latin America. It was important, he said, to support an
                        initial increase in funding. In order to continue deliveries at the rate of
                        $2.2 per year, we would need an appropriation of $2.4 billion in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962. This was less than half of the sum that
                        would be required if we attempted to achieve the strategic force objectives.
                        General Lemnitzer noted that the efforts of the Communist Bloc were growing.
                        Mutual assistance was a vital component of our security policy and needed to
                        be related to the magnitude of the Communist threat. General Lemnitzer
                        concluded by stating that he believed the program proposed was a reasonable,
                        although austere, one and justified strong support.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> concluded the
                        presentation of the five-year plan with some observations on foreign policy
                        aspects. He noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName>
                        had indicated that if military assistance deliveries were maintained at
                        present levels, we should be able to maintain a minimum acceptable defense
                        posture, though a posture far short of meeting the objectives of NSC papers.
                        In many cases, especially in the Far East and <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524"
                            facs="0556"/>the Near East, success of the military assistance program
                        depends upon education and training. Problems in such areas could not be met
                        through more assistance than was projected under the plan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> went on to observe that in
                        stating that the proposed programs were adequate, State and Defense could
                        not assure the Council that the aid contemplated would be all that would
                        have to be asked for. In preparing these plans we were operating on the
                        assumption of economic growth in the countries aided and on the assumption
                        of a capability and willingness on their part to increase their share of
                        defense expenditures. Accordingly, in the less-developed countries these
                        estimates were quite tentative. Furthermore, with the renegotiation of base
                        agreements during the next five years, there will be increased pressures for
                        additional assistance. The Communists were attempting to create chaos and
                        trouble wherever they could. Presently they were putting pressure on such
                        places as Cambodia, Burma, Indonesia, and Africa. They are making every
                        effort to change U.S. allies into neutrals and neutrals into Communists. We
                        had to have the means to move material quickly to trouble spots. The plans
                        reflected our expectations as to needs for meeting existing or anticipated
                        Communist pressures. However, if the Communists in the future should
                        concentrate their efforts at some place or some time, our efforts would have
                        to be increased.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that he was aware of
                        the importance of economic improvement in the less-developed countries.
                        Since political and economic stability were recognized as objectives of our
                        policy, we would need to find ways to increase the amounts provided for
                        economic development while maintaining security in these countries. In this
                        connection we were looking at the problem of Southeast Asia at the
                        moment.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> problem, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated, was different but more
                        disturbing. The danger in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arose from
                        the fact that we were falling further and further behind in achieving our
                        objectives. We could not meet our objectives even with a greatly increased
                        effort. This problem was complicated by our efforts to get the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries to increase their assistance to
                        the less-developed nations. This gap was recognized by the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and was weakening their
                        confidence in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military capabilities.
                        This was creating a very dangerous situation. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> countries could do more than they are doing or plan to do
                        and all are agreed on the necessity for increasing their efforts. The
                        question was how best to induce the additional effort. The action that we
                        took also had to be related to other U.S. actions in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, including the re-examination of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy for the next ten years. Our
                        plans for <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and the Development
                        Assistance Group were also clearly related to our military assistance plans
                        for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. To cut off or greatly reduce our
                        aid would not result in an increase in <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525"
                            facs="0557"/>country effort; in fact, it would have the opposite result.
                        Such action would mean that there would be nothing to fill the military gap
                        or to provide the U.S. support which was needed from a political point of
                        view. The only solution was to continue assistance on a cost-sharing basis
                        (except in the case of Greece and Turkey), making clear that we expect
                        increased effort from these countries and that we will re-assess our aid if
                        they do not make such an effort. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> noted that no grant assistance was contemplated for
                        Germany, the U.K., Luxembourg, France or Austria.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> observed that
                        military assistance created no balance-of-payments problem. In fact, such
                        assistance might help our balance-of-payments situation since, under the
                        proposed programs, there would be increased cash purchases of U.S. supplies
                        and spare parts as a result of increased European effort. We also had to
                        bear in mind the relationship of this problem to U.S. forces abroad. If our
                        balance-of-payments situation caused us to reduce these forces, we would
                        have to increase military assistance. Simultaneous reduction of U.S. forces
                        and military assistance would cause such a loss of confidence in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that it would have the gravest possible
                        effects on the structure of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It was,
                        therefore, important to maintain adequate assistance to <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1962. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out
                        that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> portion of the new
                        obligational authority contemplated for FY 1962 was $1 billion. He noted
                        that our plans contemplate continued assistance to Belgium, the Netherlands,
                        Portugal and Italy and dealt briefly with each of these in turn. In the case
                        of Belgium, there would be a special problem next year because of the
                        difficulties Belgium was having in the Congo. The Netherlands planned a
                        fifteen per cent increase in their defense effort for next year, following a
                        twelve per cent increase in 1960. In connection with our military assistance
                        plans for the Netherlands, we had to take account of the fact that the U.S.
                        was continuing military assistance to Indonesia. Our planning contemplated a
                        steady increase in Italian defense expenditures. We would work to enlarge
                        this effort but the political situation in Italy was such that a reduced
                        level of U.S. support could result in a Left-Wing government. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that the funds
                        contemplated for these four European countries represented a twenty-five per
                        cent decrease over the funds provided in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1961. This decrease was, however, related to programming realities and did
                        not represent a trend.</p>
                    <p>In Japan we planned a modest program of $50 million per year. Japanese
                        defense expenditures were at the lowest level in proportion to <gloss
                            target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> of any country we assisted. This was due
                        primarily to the postwar American policy which had resulted in
                        constitutional prohibition of Japanese military forces. The principal
                        objectives of the program for Japan were the following. We want a defense
                        build-up and the Japanese feel that they can make steep increases in their
                        defense budget; <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0558"/>such a build-up
                        should make it possible for the Japanese to carry part of the load in the
                        Far East. U.S. bases in Japan, especially naval bases, were important to us.
                        The new Mutual Security Treaty allowed us continued use of the bases for ten
                        years. If we were suddenly to start to reduce and eliminate our assistance
                        after ratification of the Mutual Security Treaty, we would strengthen the
                        forces favoring neutralism in Japan. A token military assistance program was
                        absolutely essential for this reason. In the case of Japan there were a
                        number of ways in which we could improve our own balance-of-payments and
                        budgetary situation. One of these was the settlement of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> debt. We had had to postpone
                        negotiations first because of the Mutual Security Treaty negotiations and
                        then because of the new Japanese elections. Prime Minister Ikeda had given
                        us assurances that after the elections, Japan would be prepared to conclude
                        negotiations on the subject. Ikeda had been responsible for the earlier
                        negotiations as Japanese Minister of Finance and fully recognized Japan’s
                        obligation. If we realized $600 million over a period of thirty years from
                        this settlement, we would receive $20 million per year which would offset
                        nearly one-half of the budgetary cost of the contemplated military
                        assistance program.</p>
                    <p>Concluding his comments, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> stated that he believed that the world-wide program
                        for FY 1962 should provide <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> about $2.4
                        billion. This was a figure which was slightly higher than planned deliveries
                        because of the need to build up the pipeline. The <gloss target="#t_NOA1"
                            >NOA</gloss> level in following years would be about $2.15 billion.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then read a proposed
                        Council Record of Action which would have had the Council: <list>

                    <p>Following Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s comments,
                        the President noted that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> had briefly mentioned the problem of the U.S.
                        balance-of-payments. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        had indicated that in the case of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        countries, the provision of military assistance would even result in some
                        improvement in our balance-of-payments. We all realized, the President
                        stated, that the two big problems facing us were the budget and the
                        balance-of-payments. He felt that studies of the military <pb n="527"
                            xml:id="pg_527" facs="0559"/>assistance program should not be confined
                        to amounts but should also seek to determine what kinds of assistance would
                        have a real effect in diminishing the balance-of-payments problem. If the
                        balance-of-payments got out of hand, there would be a disintegration of
                        confidence in the world. We should see what we could do about this problem
                        and should provide assistance in kind to the limit of our ability. The
                        budget problem was serious but even that was not so important as the
                        balance-of-payments problem.</p>
                    <p>In response Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted
                        that assistance to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (other than Greece
                        and Turkey) was entirely in kind. Even under cost-sharing arrangements, we
                        furnished American equipment. Assistance to Japan was also in kind. In the
                        case of the countries we were discussing, military assistance had no
                        balance-of-payments effect. In fact, as previously noted, increased European
                        defense budgets could have a positive effect on the U.S.
                        balance-of-payments.</p>
                    <p>The President referred to General Lemnitzer’s statement that the biggest
                        service we could provide to these countries was training. So far as we did
                        such training in the U.S. it was all right, but big programs in countries
                        like Laos and Cambodia involved spending dollars abroad. This was a very
                        important problem which was not being recognized in the current political
                        campaign. It was not merely a balance-of-payments problem but a problem of
                        loss of confidence in the dollar. The President suggested that a Treasury
                        representative should participate in planning of this kind.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said that State and
                        Defense were very conscious of the need to keep down dollar expenditures.
                        Eighty-five to ninety per cent of the military assistance funds were spent
                        in the U.S. and did not enter into the balance-of-payments. We were trying
                        to decrease the remainder. One way this had been done was by cutting off
                        maintenance and support funds for countries able to pay. Such action helped
                        reduce the outflow and increased the inflow of dollars. We would emphasize
                        training in the U.S. or establishment by a country of completely independent
                        training facilities within its own borders. Nonetheless, we would do some
                        training in the field through the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>s and
                        in the case of Laos and Vietnam, by means of special forces teams. However,
                        relatively small amounts of dollars were spent abroad for training. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> pointed out that during
                        most of the 1950’s, military assistance had had a small deficit effect on
                        the balance-of-payments, but during 1959–1960, it had been an overall gainer
                        of foreign exchange.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that he
                        recognized that military assistance did involve a budgetary problem. State
                        felt that the figure suggested was the best and fairest figure that could be
                        worked out between State <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0560"/>and
                        Defense as to the share of military assistance in the total defense budget.
                        He noted that the total defense budget, including <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                            >AEC</gloss> expenditures, was $45 billion or a little more.</p>
                    <p>The President referred to economic assistance and defense support, noting
                        that we keep hoping for cooperation from the richer countries in this area.
                        If military assistance was actually helpful to the U.S. balance-of-payments,
                        why did we not get the richer countries to help us with our budgetary
                        problem by picking up some of the defense support and economic assistance?
                        In response, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed
                        out that he and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        were planning to go to Germany soon<note n="6" xml:id="d266fn6"><persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                                >Anderson</persName> visited Bonn November 19–23, Paris November
                            23–25, and London November 25–26. Documentation on their trip is in

                            59, Conference Files: FRC 83–0068, CF 1781–1788.</note> to attempt to
                        get the Germans to increase their contribution to economic assistance. The
                        President suggested that they ought to go to two or three other countries.
                        The President said that he did not argue with the order-of-magnitude of the
                        proposed program but he did not think that we were tough enough about
                        insisting that our military assistance be provided in kind. Also, we ought
                        to get other countries to pick up more of the economic aid burden. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated that he would be
                        making some suggestions on economic aid in the next two or three weeks.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that he did
                        not want to be unduly critical of those who had prepared these plans, but he
                        had a feeling of frustration when he read statements like the following
                        which appeared in the summary of the plan: “Any amounts in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 substantially less than $2.4 billion
                        will make it improbable that a strategic concept that includes reliance on
                        allied military power and bases to meet the cold, limited, and general war
                        threat can be maintained. The implementation of any other budget or
                        financial policy to the extent that it requires a substantial downward
                        change in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962–1966 plan will require
                        a change in basic U.S. national policy and strategic objectives for the
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962–1966 period.” Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> observed that whenever a
                        suggestion was made for a reduction of military expenditure in any respect,
                        the answer was always put in terms of which divisions should be pulled out
                        of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or in terms of proposing to pull
                        the 7th Fleet out of the Formosa Straits. Nothing else, it seemed, could be
                        done to reduce military expenditures.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he was
                        astounded by the comments that had been made on the balance-of-payments. If
                        this proposed program were put into effect, he could not assume
                        responsibility for the security of the dollar. The London gold market had
                        opened at $36 an ounce this morning. This reduction in the price of gold was
                        not simply a matter of chance; it was the result of hard work. The loss of
                        confidence <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0561"/>in the dollar was being
                        registered on the face of the world. We talk about what other countries will
                        do but they have a good thing going and know it; they are not going to give
                        it up as a result of persuasion by us. They are not that loyal to <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nor do they feel that kind of obligation
                        to us as a result of our Marshall aid. These countries were not going to
                        support the dollar. The only way that we could get countries like Germany to
                        take action was to get them to put these expenditures into their budgets. A
                        long-term loan to the U.S. would be only a palliative. When we talk about
                        military assistance, we should insist that countries like Germany and France
                        buy their military equipment requirements.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> interjected to say
                        that Germany and France did purchase their military assistance needs;
                        nothing was included in the five-year plan for these countries. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> stated that we should
                        consider the other countries then. We could not afford such aid and if we
                        continued it, we would face the worst collapse you ever saw. This year there
                        had been a $4.5 million increase in our trade balance on current account and
                        yet the balance-of-payments deficit was running at an annual rate of $5–6
                        billion in the third quarter. If we ran such a deficit for twelve months, we
                        would destroy the international gold standard.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> pointed out that we
                        had received only $1.4 billion for military assistance last year, yet now it
                        was proposed that we go for $2.5 billion. We were talking of a five-year
                        plan but if we had made such a plan in 1955, it would have been out of date
                        in 1956. The balance-of-payments problem did not face us until 1956. We were
                        in trouble right now and had to take action now. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then reviewed the various <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> actions on this subject, quoting several of
                        them. He went on to point out that the financial side of the plan had not
                        been approved by those who provided the money. Treasury was given a few days
                        to look at such plans and then, when we got into an argument, was told that
                        this was not a good time to reduce assistance. He again emphasized that
                        continuing on this course would bring us the greatest holocaust we had ever
                        seen.</p>
                    <p>The problem was how to get increased effort from these countries, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> observed. We would not
                        get it, he felt, by doing what was proposed. The lines on the chart should
                        go in opposite directions; that is, U.S. aid should be decreasing while the
                        country efforts increase. Italy, Japan, Belgium, and the Netherlands were
                        all able to pay. The trouble that Belgium was having in the Congo was
                        peanuts compared with the troubles facing the U.S. We were facing a day of
                        reckoning. We were going to have to continue economic assistance and much of
                        the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> aid could not be tied to dollar
                        purchases. As for decentralization of the planning process, the field people
                        just did not know the balance-of-payments problem. They had to be taught to
                            <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0562"/>do their job differently. The
                        Secretary noted there were 354,000 dependents of U.S. personnel in Europe.
                        These were a hazard, a liability, and a cost. Getting $20 million per year
                        from a <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement would not solve
                        our problem. In the Secretary’s lifetime we had not been faced by a problem
                        as serious as the one facing us today. Moreover, this was a unique
                        experience; it had never happened to the U.S. before. He referred to a
                        conversation with the Prime Minister of Malaya who had suggested that the
                        U.S. was over-committed.</p>
                    <p>It is said, the Secretary stated, that this was just a budgetary problem. If
                        he had to make a choice between a budgetary problem and a
                        balance-of-payments problem, he would prefer the budgetary problem. However,
                        every time we spend dollars abroad, gold went out of Fort Knox. People
                        abroad are sophisticated and know all about the U.S. budget. If we let them
                        believe that we are going to have a severe budgetary problem, it will
                        destroy confidence in the dollar.</p>
                    <p>The President said that one thing was not clear to him. Was it true that the
                        military assistance program itself would result in a budgetary deficit?
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> agreed that it
                        would not produce a budgetary deficit if cuts were made elsewhere but he
                        pointed out that $1 billion more was proposed for military assistance.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the figure
                        was $600 million rather than $1 billion. However, he agreed with what
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had said about the
                        dollar, about the balance-of-payments, and about the time factor. His only
                        disagreement related to the programs for Japan, Belgium, Portugal and the
                        Netherlands where ten per cent of the total projected assistance was
                        scheduled to go. It was absolutely certain that if aid to these countries
                        was eliminated, they would not buy the same amount in the U.S. In fact, they
                        would not buy it at all. The result would be a weakened fabric of defense.
                        He stated that if the choice was between purchase here and grant assistance,
                        he would favor purchase. These countries had gold. The problem, however, was
                        the size of their defense budget. He noted that the defense budgets of the
                        Netherlands and Japan are increasing substantially. He concluded by saying
                        that these programs involved no balance-of-payments effect, only a budget
                        effect. He agreed that the budget effect should be considered in the overall
                        budget review. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        said that we could not afford an increase of fifty per cent in military
                        assistance. If you added up all security expenditures and the service on the
                        debt, you got a figure that was seventy-five per cent of the budget. Where
                        then could you cut? It was difficult to see how you could make cuts in the
                        rest of the budget and do what the people on both sides in this election
                        were calling for. If we took in in taxes one hundred per cent of all
                        personal income above $16,000 our revenues would be increased by only four
                        per cent.</p>
                    <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0563"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> pointed out that the
                        increase to $2.4 billion in <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> was intended
                        not to increase but to maintain expenditures. We had been living off the
                        pipeline of $8 billion built up in the period 1953–1954. The President
                        agreed that perhaps this was so, but while you were building up the
                        pipeline, you created this budget problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"
                            >Irwin</persName> pointed out that military assistance constituted 17.2
                        per cent of the total defense effort in Belgium. If we adopted the proposed
                        program with cost-sharing, the proportion would go down to 4.9 per cent in
                        the period 1962–1966. The reduction for the Netherlands would be from 19.3
                        per cent to 10.3 per cent; for Portugal, from 27.7 per cent to 7 per cent;
                        for Japan, from 19.8 per cent to 9 per cent; and overall, from 17.7 per cent
                        to 8.2 per cent. The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"
                            >Irwin</persName> how much military assistance would increase U.S.
                        exports and improve the U.S. balance-of-payments. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said that we did not know that it
                        would increase our exports, but it should maintain them. It would result in
                        a decrease in the U.S. proportion of the defense effort in these countries
                        and should have a good effect on the balance-of-payments.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> observed that last
                        year we had had a $3.8 billion balance-of-payments deficit. We had all
                        agreed as to the necessity of improving the U.S. exports. This year exports
                        had been increased by $4.5 billion. This should have meant a surplus in our
                        balance-of-payments. Instead, we would have the biggest deficit in the
                        history of the U.S. In the first quarter the deficit had been running at an
                        annual rate of $1.8 billion. Now, however, it was anticipated that the
                        deficit would be over $3 billion for the year and it was running at an
                        annual rate of $5-$6 billion in the third quarter. We were going to have a
                        terrible time with the problem of balancing the budget. He did not
                        understand how we could balance the budget and still increase military
                        assistance. The President said that he assumed that when Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> referred to balancing the budget,
                        he was talking about the cash budget. The plan as he understood it, called
                        for military assistance expenditures in the same amount as in the past. He
                        therefore could not see how military assistance would create a new problem
                        so far as the cash budget was concerned. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> replied that if <gloss
                            target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> was raised, expenditures eventually had to
                        increase.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> suggested that the
                        Council look at this program from the defense standpoint for a moment. This
                        program was interrelated with U.S. deployments. It was a better program, he
                        felt, to support Free World strength than the alternatives to it. The
                        President asked whether any dependents had been ordered back from overseas.
                        He suggested that we had better stop sending them overseas. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> observed that we were
                        faced by a very serious choice. He understood the balance-of-payments and
                        budget problem and had himself emphasized their importance. However, the
                        proposed program <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0564"/>was a better
                        program to base ourselves on than on some of the other things that we were
                        doing. He noted that the program would be subject to annual review.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> stated that the
                        dollar was under pressure and that the world was watching us. The promises
                        that had been made in this campaign had triggered a run on the bank;
                        something else might have triggered it if the campaign had not done so. We
                        were saying in the campaign that we were going to appropriate more without
                        raising taxes. The only alternatives then were to borrow and inflate or to
                        impose controls. Those abroad who held our money knew that these were the
                        alternatives. They could pull out their deposits in this country and we
                        would be off the gold standard.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> pointed out that there had
                        been no discussion with Budget about resources in the development of this
                        plan. He felt there were some facts that needed to be considered in this
                        connection. The mid-FY 1961 budget review had indicated a surplus of $1.1
                        billion. We know that the situation has since eroded. Although we could not
                        say so publicly, it was possible that we might end the year in the red.
                        Defense expenditures were moving up as a result of action by the Services
                        and revenues were down because of reduced corporate profits. It would not be
                        critical if there was a deficit this year but this year’s budget provided
                        the base for the next one. The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 budget
                        had built-in increases for civil programs of $1.75 billion. In addition,
                        Congress had earmarked $800 million of revenues for highway construction.
                        Together these two items made a total of over $2.5 billion of added charges
                        and would eat up all of the expected revenue increase without a single new
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Looking down through the years, we faced an even greater problem. A Library
                        of Congress study indicated that the U.S. national debt was $90 billion more
                        than the debts of all other Free World countries put together. Our per
                        capita debt was also larger. We owed tremendous amounts beyond this for past
                        services in the form of military and civilian retirement. We had a $300
                        billion obligation to veterans. These commitments totaled three-quarters of
                        a trillion dollars. These chickens were coming home to roost in the form of
                        $1.5-$2 billion increases each year in budget expenditures.</p>
                    <p>Our aggregate defense expenditures, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                            >Stans</persName> pointed out, were almost ten per cent of our <gloss
                            target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. In all the countries to which we were
                        providing assistance, the percentage was substantially less. For example,
                        the figure for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries was less than
                        five per cent.</p>
                    <p>The Council was not being asked to approve the five-year plan but it was
                        being asked to approve a program of the general order-of-magnitude proposed
                        for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962, subject to budget review.
                        Presumably, it was intended that such review should be as to details only.
                        This planning concept was not being presented with the details which <pb
                            n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0565"/>were usually presented in
                        connection with the budget. It started out with the so-called strategic
                        objectives which frequently exceed <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70
                        objectives. We did not take account of the willingness of the countries
                        themselves to support these strategic objectives. The strategic objectives
                        call for ten divisions for Italy as compared with five under <gloss
                            target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70. Since even the lesser <gloss
                            target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70 goals were not going to be achieved, it
                        was unrealistic to plan for larger goals. The proposed program of $11
                        billion for five years was sixty per cent more than Congress had been
                        willing to appropriate in the last five years. There was no indication as to
                        what the plan would require in defense support assistance which was a
                        substantial part of the Mutual Security Program. Apart from their political
                        unwillingness to meet the strategic objectives, some countries, for example,
                        Korea, want to reduce those objectives. There was no indication that such
                        desires were taken into account in the development of the plan. There was
                        also no indication as to whether the plan took account of Soviet intentions
                        to reduce Russian forces.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> went on to say that there
                        were no indications that reductions had been made in other programs to take
                        account of missiles to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>; for example,
                        to take account of the recent <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>
                            decision.<note n="7" xml:id="d266fn7">Reference is presumably to a U.S.
                            proposal to create a multilateral nuclear force in Europe.</note>
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> observed that he had
                        previously noted the relationship between these decisions and the military
                        program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> stated, however,
                        that we had done nothing but note the relationship. He also pointed out that
                        there were various studies on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        presently underway which could affect our assistance programs and that
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> planned to review the <gloss
                            target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70 goals in the spring. It was difficult, he
                        said, to judge the proposed program without reference to the military
                        strategy. It was also difficult to see why we could induce other countries
                        to do more only by increasing our own assistance. They might increase their
                        efforts more if we reduced our aid. He agreed with sub-paragraph a of the
                        proposed Record of Action but he could not agree with the proposal that the
                        Council concur in the proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962
                        program. Military assistance should compete with the rest of the defense
                        budget; that had been the idea a year ago when we had put military
                        assistance in the defense budget. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                            >Stans</persName> concluded by stating that for years now we had
                        transfused our strength to European countries. Now they were strong. We
                        could not continue these transfusions without reducing our own strength.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> noted that the military
                        assistance plans were aligned with strategic policies in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> documents. The Joint Chiefs of Staff based
                        their strategic objectives on the policies of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss>. He went on to say that, as had been stated, <gloss
                            target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70 objectives were slightly smaller <pb
                            n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0566"/>than <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> strategic objectives. Of the ten divisions included in the
                        strategic objectives for Italy, five represented the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> first line requirement and the other five
                        represented the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> second line
                        requirement. These latter five had never been at full strength and were not
                        fully supported in the plan. The plan provided for support at a level which
                        would mean minimum achievement of objectives. If these objectives were to be
                        implemented fully, it would cost $25 billion. The $11 billion provided for
                        in this plan was less than one-half of the cost of meeting the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> strategic objectives. We do, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> stated, take account of Soviet
                        actions in everything relating to our forces and to military assistance.
                        However, the recent <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> on the Soviet force
                        reductions indicated that the reduction in Soviet military manpower did not
                        involve reduction in Soviet military strength. The Soviet action was
                        designed to strengthen Russian military forces and to make manpower
                        available to the economy. There was a question also as to whether they would
                        in fact carry out their present plans. He noted that the Soviets were well
                        into the second generation of modernization whereas, if the proposed
                        five-year plan were carried out, European forces would still be heavily
                        dependent on obsolete equipment. He agreed that the <gloss target="#t_MRBM1"
                            >MRBM</gloss> decision had to be considered in relation to this plan. He
                        said that, of course, we could not be sure how the review of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy would come out but it was his
                        guess that we would come out with basically the same strategy, which was
                        based on agreed political strategy. If we continued to accept a forward
                        strategy, there might be some changes in military assistance—for example,
                        there might be increased modernization—but the plan would not be basically
                        affected. All of this planning had been approached from the point of view of
                        our own interests and had attempted to take account of the
                        balance-of-payments and economic problems. The Mutual Security Program, in
                        both its economic and military aspects, is essential to the maintenance of
                        the Free World position and U.S. leadership. To reduce it substantially
                        would have dangerous repercussions on the political, military, and
                        psychological side that were similar in character to what Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> was worried about on the
                        financial side. This was only one of the programs included in the budget and
                        was de minimus so far as balance-of payments effects were concerned. All
                        programs, he felt, should be looked at with the same care.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that if the possibility of balancing the budget next
                        year is being endangered, he would not send the budget forward without
                        definite recommendations on taxes. Another problem was, of course, how much
                        you could tax without slowing up the economy. You could increase taxes for a
                        short time or in a wartime situation but we were talking here about the next
                        forty years. There was not, however, much hope for getting favorable action
                        on taxes. Attempts to eliminate the postal deficit and to get interest rates
                        on a <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0567"/>realistic basis had not
                        succeeded. It just did not seem possible to impress Congress with the
                        necessity for action. In connection with the President’s last remark,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> noted that it had
                        not been possible even to get hearings on changing the exceptions in the tax
                        laws relating to Building and Loan Associations and to cooperatives.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> asked why we could not get
                        other countries to carry more of the load themselves and referred in this
                        connection to the increases that had occurred in the gold reserves of
                        several <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. The President noted
                        that he knew from his experience that people abroad did not look at the
                        problem in terms of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. Instead, they
                        compared standards of living and asked us in what ways we are making a
                        sacrifice. They do not think of the problem in dollar terms as we were doing
                        in this discussion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName>
                        referred to the chart included in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"
                            >Irwin</persName>’s presentation, which indicated that $9.4 billion in
                        military assistance expenditures would induce $93 billion in country effort.
                        This kind of analysis overlooks the fact that U.S. defense expenditures are
                        $45 billion per year, or $225 billion for the next five years. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> wondered why we could not convince
                        other Free World countries that, if we were going to be spending this much
                        on their defense, they should not put more into their defense.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> reminded the Council
                        that the five-year plan called for $1 billion per year for <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries of which only $200 million went
                        to the five countries with which we were most immediately concerned. This
                        was a relatively small percentage of the overall budgetary problem. Someone
                        would have to exercise judgment as to its importance in relationship to
                        other programs but State and Defense had done the best they could to develop
                        a program of manageable size. If you asked the Italians to increase their
                        defense budget, they might throw the government out. It was very difficult
                        to get increased defense expenditures approved by the Italian Parliament
                        when the income in the south of Italy was ten per cent of ours. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> suggested that, if we
                        had to, we should say that all military training will be done in the U.S. It
                        was being said that if we did not furnish military assistance, these
                        countries would not meet their military needs through purchases. If this was
                        the situation, we had better find it out. It was important that we find out
                        whether these countries were interested in defending themselves. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> referred to the fact
                        that when the U.S. had run a budgetary deficit in 1958, the Central Bank of
                        Italy, under the instructions of the Italian Parliament, had withdrawn $2.5
                        billion in gold from the U.S. He said that the President had provided real
                        leadership on these fiscal problems but the question was how we were going
                        to raise the money required to support such programs. He noted that half our
                        deficit since 1945 was accounted for by the Post Office and yet we could not
                        get Congress to raise postal rates.</p>
                    <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0568"/>
                    <p>The President observed that you could not take this problem in a vacuum. If
                        the problem was to be solved and stay solved and if you were going to avoid
                        disaster, you would have to look at the whole budget. However, as long as we
                        were facing a Soviet threat, we would have to make defense the prime factor.
                        We should cut other programs and also require the Defense Department to make
                        some hard decisions. Finally, additional revenues might possibly be needed.
                        Secrectary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> felt we should
                        tell other countries that if they want a tank, they should buy it. He
                        pointed out that cost-sharing programs had resulted, in the case of the
                        F–104, in the construction of a competitive aircraft factory in Europe at a
                        time when two of the existing six aircraft factories in the U.S. could meet
                        all U.S. defense needs. In the long run you could not live with this kind of
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> suggested that the
                        difficulty was that we always assumed that we should do more; we started
                        with a $2.5 billion program and then discounted it. We need first to
                        determine what you could buy for $2.4 billion and submit the results to the
                        usual budgetary review. We should also take a look at the effects of a lower
                        figure—say, $1.5 billion—on our defense position. Sacrifices had to be made;
                        to start with the presumption that we had to do more was fatal.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that in
                        the preparation of the plan the planners had taken account of defense
                        support. They had assumed, in developing their plans, that defense support
                        would not increase, but would instead be phased out in accordance with the
                        requirement of the Mansfield Amendment. The possible reduction in Korean
                        forces would not, he said, result in a decrease in military assistance,
                        although it might possibly mean a reduction in defense support. Such a
                        manpower reduction in Korea would be based upon provision of better
                        equipment to the Korean forces. He did not ask now for a determination of
                        the level of one part of the budget, but he wanted to be able to submit a
                        program of this magnitude to the Bureau of the Budget which could then look
                        it over in detail. The military assistance program did not stand out in Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s judgment as the program
                        which should be cut before any other.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, attempting to sum up the
                        discussion, stated that he understood that it had been agreed that a
                        decision on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 military assistance
                        program would not be taken in a vacuum; that is, in isolation from the rest
                        of the budget. He pointed out that it had been suggested that there be a
                        change in the determination contained in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        Action 2275. This action provided that two countries were to be notified
                        that military assistance will immediately be at a lower level and two others
                        were to be advised of an eventual decrease in assistance. In response, the
                        President stated that, as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> had pointed out, the problem was facing us right
                        now and could not be dealt with on a gradual basis. The budget and
                        balance-of-payments <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0569"/>problem could
                        destroy the defenses of the U.S. To say that we would tell other countries
                        that we will reduce assistance to them next year or in two years would not
                        solve the problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> observed
                        that these countries were to be told of our intentions at the time they are
                        provided the figures for the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 program.
                        The President stated that the world wants to know if we are going to meet
                        our obligations. More and more he was beginning to think that this was a
                        problem of revenue.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> turned to General Lemnitzer
                        and asked whether, in developing the strategic objectives, the Joint Chiefs
                        applied the same sort of hard judgments as when they developed U.S. force
                        objectives. For example, were the strategic objectives for Pakistan really
                        designed to deal with the Soviet threat? What part of these objectives
                        reflected the desire of the Pakistanis to have forces of comparable size to
                        those of India? The President observed that Pakistan was more afraid of
                        Afghanistan than it was of India. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                            >Gray</persName> said that if that was so, the Afghan threat could be
                        identified as a Soviet threat and his question was answered. However, if the
                        U.S. defense budget was simply a compilation of unilateral Service requests,
                        we would have a much higher budget than we did have. He wondered whether in
                        arriving at strategic objectives we applied some judgment as to the ability
                        of the country to finance such a military establishment. General Lemnitzer
                        said that overall the Joint Chiefs did apply the same criteria as they
                        applied in determining U.S. objectives. In Pakistan we had a variety of
                        military objectives and we realize that these compete with economic needs.
                        It was obvious you could not build Pakistani forces up to the point where
                        they could withstand the Soviet Union if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> concentrated its forces against Pakistan. The program for
                        Pakistan is pretty austere and of the kind that Ayub thinks he needs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> stated that the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 program should be presented to the
                        Budget in detail and that the Budget presentation should also include
                        information on the sacrifices that would be involved in a lower program of,
                        say, $1.5 billion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said
                        that Defense was ready to submit details to the Bureau of the Budget. He
                        pointed out that we did not plan to reinforce the conventional capabilities
                        of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and that if the program
                        were cut to $1.5 billion, you would be cutting <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>’s nuclear deterrent. The net effect, therefore, would be
                        that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would have neither a defensive
                        nor a nuclear offensive capability. The President suggested that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>’s question was a good
                        one—why were not these countries concerned about their own defense? Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> pointed out that several
                        of the countries receiving military assistance had increased their defense
                        expenditures greatly and that we should be able to get further increases in
                        their expenditures. The question here was whether the U.S. should continue
                        doing what we were now doing. The President expressed the view that State
                            <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0570"/>and Defense should submit the
                        proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 military assistance program
                        through the budgetary process and that from that point it would be handled
                        along with the rest of the budget.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> attempted to sum up the
                        discussion, suggesting that the Council Record should show that the Council
                        had considered the results of State-Defense planning and should reflect the
                        fact that it was important to have long-range plans. In this connection
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> observed that such
                        plans did not involve commitments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                            >Gray</persName> went on to say that the Record would show that program
                        levels for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 would be decided through
                        the budgetary process. He asked whether the Record should show that no
                        action had been taken on the Newport directive (i.e. <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Action 2275). Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> closed the discussion by stating that he would like
                        to discuss the Newport directive with the President in the light of the
                        Council discussion.</p>

                    <p>You will recall that the question of how to treat military assistance
                        programs for the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium and Japan in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 and beyond was fully discussed at the
                        National Security Council meeting of October 31.<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2"
                            >See <ref target="#d266">Document 266</ref>.</note> This now requires a
                        decision, since we must proceed very shortly to notify these countries
                        regarding their previously approved fiscal year 1961 military assistance
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>As indicated in the Council meeting, the Treasury Department and the Budget
                        Bureau feel that military assistance for these countries should be sharply
                        reduced in fiscal year 1962 and totally eliminated over the next two to
                        three years. As you are aware we believe that the balance of payments
                        problem is not affected by a decision on this question. The difference in
                        budgetary terms between the cost of the military assistance we propose for
                        fiscal year 1962 and that which might be provided under the Treasury-Budget
                        Bureau theory would be less than 5% of the total fiscal year 1962 Military
                        Assistance Program proposed.</p>
                    <p>For the reasons stated more fully in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        meeting, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> and I feel
                        strongly that the increased defense contributions from these countries which
                        are so necessary to our security posture, can only be obtained if we
                        continue an adequate measure of U. S. military assistance, making such
                        assistance contingent upon appropriate increases in their defense
                        budgets.</p>
                    <p>It is perfectly clear that reducing or eliminating the relatively low levels
                        of military assistance in these four countries would lead them to infer that
                        U.S. interest in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the defense of
                        the Far East was diminishing and that a “Fortress America” concept was being
                        seriously considered. It would therefore lead to reductions in the defense
                        expenditures of these countries, meaning in turn a substantial weakening of
                        our entire defense posture. This would be particularly the case should the
                        U. S. raise the possibility of reducing the level of its own forces in
                        Europe during next year’s <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> review.</p>
                    <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0572"/>
                    <p>With this in mind, and since we feel convinced that despite their
                        satisfactory gold reserves none of these countries is budgetarily able to
                        accommodate the very substantial increases which would be necessary if
                        military assistance programs were eliminated over the next two or three
                        years, I feel that we should handle the problem of notifying them regarding
                        our future intentions along the lines set forth in the attached draft
                            telegrams.<note n="3" xml:id="d267fn3">None printed. The operative
                            portions of the draft telegrams to Rome, The Hague, and Brussels stated
                            future U.S. grant military assistance was contingent on increases in the
                            Italian, Dutch, and Belgian defense budgets, respectively. The draft
                            telegram to Tokyo noted future U.S. contributions would depend not only
                            on U.S. appropriations, but on Japan’s ability to finance its share of
                            contemplated force improvement projects.</note> Secretary <persName

                            >Herter</persName> now proposes to send these four countries would not
                        carry out my understanding of the language or the spirit of the August 1
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>Given the now very substantial financial capabilities of these four countries
                        and the balance of payments and budgetary problems which now face the United
                        States, I cannot concur in the recommendations made to you in the November
                        13 memorandum.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName>’s memorandum and the
                        attached draft cables would call for continued and possibly increased levels
                        of military assistance for the purpose of inducing these countries to
                        increase their defense budgets—something they are fully capable of doing
                        financially without such assistance from us.</p>
                    <p>The memorandum appears to proceed on two basic assumptions: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners (even those
                                with very substantial financial capabilities) and Japan would
                                construe any future reduction in the level of United States military
                                assistance as a lack of U.S. interest in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> and the defense of the Far East and a start down
                                the road towards a “fortress America” concept.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Without attempting to pass judgment on the military and foreign policy
                        validity of the present <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Far East
                        strategic force goals, I can say that our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and other military alliances are very weak reeds for the
                        defense of the Free World if our financially able allies are not willing to
                        increase their defense expenditures as their financial abilities increase
                        and the financial problems of the United States become critical—in large
                        part owing to the tremendous amount of assistance we have given these
                        countries in reaching their present healthy situation. If our alliances are
                        that weak, the time has now come to reappraise them. In the past few years
                        we have discontinued new commitments for grant military assistance to the
                        United Kingdom, Germany, and France without any damage to the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> structure. We should be able to expect
                        similar responsible reaction from the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium and
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>The level of grant military assistance to these four countries which is now
                        running about $250 million a year is a substantial budgetary item for us.
                        However, even more important at the present time is the balance of payments
                        effect of continuing military aid. If the military <pb n="542"
                            xml:id="pg_542" facs="0574"/>equipment which we are now giving these
                        countries is of real importance to their military position, they should be
                        buying it (thereby increasing our exports and assisting our balance of
                        payments position) instead of our providing it to them free. Apparently the
                        only way they can be forced to purchase the military equipment they need is
                        through an orderly reduction and elimination of grant military assistance to
                        them on our part. When we assume a heavy military burden, as we are doing,
                        and let these four financially able countries off with a light burden, we
                        weaken the whole competitive position of the United States in world markets
                        which is so important in our fight to surmount our balance of payments
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>At the time the August 1 decision was made our balance of payments deficit
                        had been running at an annual rate of $2.7 billion. Today it appears that
                        this deficit is running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.4
                        billion. Therefore, there is even greater reason today than there was in
                        August to carry forward immediately your directive above-mentioned in <gloss

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> opened by requesting the
                        President to examine our mutual security program for the 1962 budget. He
                        thought it would be pointless at this stage to try to address the budget on
                        an item-by-item basis. As of now, guidance can be reduced to two questions
                        regarding (1) the level of mutual security program budget requests for 1962,
                        and (2) whether there should be a supplemental request of $150 million for
                        the Development Loan Fund in 1961. At this point the President read the
                        paper appended hereto<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">Not printed.</note> which
                        analyzes these two questions.</p>
                    <p>The President then recalled the statement by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting to
                        the effect that the foreign aid program does not affect the balance of
                        payments problem as much as does the procurement of military items
                            overseas.<note n="3" xml:id="d270fn3">See <ref target="#d266">Document
                                266</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> agreed with this statement since much of the
                        military assistance program funds are spent in the U.S. However, he fears
                        that the type of economic help which will be necessary in Africa will not be
                        susceptible to U.S. procurement.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the first question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said the State Department had originally thought $5.5
                        billion desirable, but in view of the tight budget, they had reduced this
                        figure. They now feel that $4.75 billion MAP is the lowest adequate figure.
                        The greatest difference comes in the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>
                        which has loaned out over half a billion dollars this year. As examples, in
                        India and Pakistan their total <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans
                        come to some $500 million. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        said that the next Administration<note n="4" xml:id="d270fn4"><persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName> was elected President
                            in national elections held November 8.</note> has made considerable
                        noise over the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>. This fact may justify
                        our going to the usual level in our own budget with the expectation that the
                        new Administration will raise it. If this Administration had responsibility
                        all through next year, we could not live with this figure. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that the large figure
                        for new obligational authority of the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>
                        will not translate much into expenditures.</p>
                    <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0576"/>
                    <p>The President asked whether other countries are doing their share to pick up
                        the load. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that other
                        countries are merely working in the direction of picking up their fair
                        share. The demands in India, for example, are so large as to absorb any
                        differential and to preclude the possibility of reduction of U.S. funds.
                        Britain, for example, doubled her foreign aid last year and Germany has now
                        begun with a program of $1.7 billion. The French and the British have a
                        program of $0.5 billion apiece per year. The Dutch and Swiss are
                        contributing.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> expressed concern over
                        the posture that this program puts the President in. We have now reached the
                        end of an era and we can no longer live as we did in the past. Other nations
                        have financed their deficits and this has resulted in withdrawal from our
                        gold supplies. We have supported the World Bank, the International Monetary
                        Fund, the Inter-American Development Board, and we have now embarked on a
                        $600 million program for development in Latin America.<note n="5"

                        these will come to $10 billion capital investment total. If we attempt to
                        afford the same levels as in the past, our expenditures are likely to exceed
                        our revenues.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that the
                        military assistance program does not affect balance of payments very much.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that it does affect
                        balance of payments some and that it is not sufficient to avoid exacerbating
                        the balance of payments situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said he thought we should
                        cut our mutual security program country by country. He feels a figure of
                        $3.46 billion is best. At all odds, it should not exceed the figure of $4.25
                        billion, but would be preferable not to exceed a round figure of $4 billion.
                        This figure will give us good support in Congress.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed some doubt about the support in Congress and said
                        that we are now approaching the hardest choice possible to make. The world
                        situation is worse rather than better, and, therefore, demands more help. On
                        the other hand, he himself is concerned with balance of payments as much as
                        anyone; and he realizes that we can defeat ourselves by violating fiscal
                        soundness. The only way out is to find a means of forcing other countries to
                        do their full share in carrying world responsibilities. He pointed up the
                        privileged status of Germany, which, while she is willing to contribute $1.7
                        billion dollars this year, has the background of contributing nothing. She
                        has been living in the best of two worlds. On our own part, one move we can
                        make is to redeploy troops.</p>
                    <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0577"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he realizes this is
                        a poor time to do such a thing. We should not redeploy many troops, but we
                        should begin the process. If forced to the choice, we should deploy major
                        forces rather than place ourselves in a position where we must starve other
                        nations by cutting mutual security. The President pointed out that he has
                        been taking a position for eight years that we should reduce the size of our
                        forces in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that if we make a
                        move to redeploy troops he will be able to withdraw many objections to
                        maintaining sizeable mutual security. The President said he had checked with
                        General Lemnitzer on withdrawing troops from Japan and found that all that
                        is left there are two important air bases. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said the hard money area in Europe is the key to
                        the problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said maybe we can take half
                        our forces out of Germany within the next few years. To Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>’s question, he said he personally
                        would be willing to begin this movement in calendar year 1962, but could not
                        speak for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said we have to hit the
                        problem again in a couple of days. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1"
                            >Gates</persName> has bad news from Defense and estimates that Defense
                        budget will go up $2 billion for a total of $43.3 billion. All he can see is
                        substantial redeployment and a reduction of forces. The Air Force is willing
                        to redeploy units from Europe, but the Army, however, is not. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented that the Army can see this
                        as a move toward reduction in their total force.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> reviewed recent
                        withdrawals, to include $490 million in gold in the month of November.
                        Britain withdrew $50 million yesterday and the Treasury will have to
                        announce an additional $75 million on Thursday. This is beginning to
                        resemble a run on gold. The President said we must tell the British that
                        while they have certain traditions, we have some also; one of these is the
                        soundness of the dollar, and we will take all means necessary to preserve
                        it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that if we
                        continue the current rate of withdrawals, we will reach an annual rate of $6
                        billion which will constitute a real run on gold. It is impossible, of
                        course, to predict circumstances which will exist in a year. Yesterday the
                        dollar was stronger than it had been in weeks. By contrast, pound sterling
                        was weaker. It is possible, though not certain, that the dollar was
                        strengthened by the fact that we have placed Europe on notice. He further
                        admitted that short term capital may be coming back to the U.S. He does not
                        visualize the rate of interest as affecting this problem too much. With
                        whatever optimistic signs one may find, however, the fundamental fact is
                        that people abroad are concerned over the dollar.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> said that he hopes that
                        State can agree that the redeployment of forces in Europe might be taken up
                        in December <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that the matter should be
                        brought up, but <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0578"/>had not figured on
                        the exact amount. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        admitted that the psychological problem is difficult because the people
                        abroad do not know the facts, such as this figure of $490 million withdrawal
                        in November. Only sophisticates know this. He has made an exhaustive study
                        of the purchase of gold bonds in Toronto. There has been a large amount of
                        this purchasing from the U.S., particularly from the west and south. Texas
                        is the worst offender. Oddly enough, it is not the rich. This matter in
                        itself does not concern [him] too much since he feels this action is the
                        result of gold speculators.</p>
                    <p>Recently Senator Murray had asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> to come to the Senate and testify on the balance of
                        payments. He himself had called Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1"
                            >Fulbright</persName> and had said that he does not want anyone in the
                        government to testify at this time. Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1"
                            >Fulbright</persName> agreed to back us up on this matter.</p>
                    <p>The President said that our budget message should start out with an
                        explanation of our objectives in the monetary field. It should set out the
                        facts of life baldly. It should admit, however, that we cannot keep the
                        peace if we turn our back on the world. He expressed doubt regarding Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s position concerning the
                        disastrous consequences of cutting mutual security below $4 billion. Our
                        budget must reflect our basic philosophy and our budget must be balanced. We
                        cannot afford to neglect measures which will be useful in cutting down a
                        balance of payments deficit. In general terms, he prefers to submit mutual
                        security requests in round terms such as $4 billion rather than $4,175
                        billion. Further, we should go to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                        tell them that we plan to withdraw two divisions. We should reduce the
                        overstaffed <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> infrastructure, bring home
                        Americans, and hire French and Germans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said if mutual security
                        must be cut drastically, he would hope that $2 billion would be taken off
                        MAP and $50 million off economic assistance. The President referred to the
                        new Latin American assistance program and said that unless this shows some
                        promise of success, we are in real trouble. Castro is showing success in
                        exporting Communism. Latin American governments must be willing to make
                        social reforms if we are going to continue a level of aid to them. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he felt that Latin
                        America is the area where we should concentrate our efforts on aid. We
                        should say to the European countries that they are the ones who have had
                        vested interests in Asia and Africa. The President expressed agreement and
                        said he had been talking to heads of some of the Latin American countries
                        for a couple of years on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> then brought up the second
                        question of the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>. He expressed the hope
                        that we would not add an extra $150 million to the fund this year. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said this is necessary,
                        since we had a battle over this matter last year and promised to come back
                        to reopen the <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0579"/>battle this year. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> argued that Congress has
                        exercised its will in refusing an extra $150 million for the <gloss
                            target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> twice. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                            >Stans</persName> accused the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> staff
                        of getting rid of money by the end of the year to prove requirements for the
                        next year, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> admitted
                        there was some of that going on. The President said that he himself had put
                        personal pressure for this $150 million for the <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                            >DLF</gloss> and he felt he must follow through with this request.</p>
                    <p>As the meeting ended the President mentioned again that he had always been in
                        favor of troop redeployment. He reiterated his request that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> discuss with the Secretary of
                        Defense the proposal to inform the North Atlantic Council, during the
                        forthcoming December meetings, that unless relief is obtained in the coming
                        year in meeting the costs of maintaining American units in Europe, and other
                        methods are found to relieve the adverse effect of our balance of payments
                        position, it will be necessary for the United States to withdraw a portion
                        of its European contingent by the end of calendar year 1962.</p>

                        a possible course of action in view of the Comptroller General’s decision

                            Inspector General and Comptroller, as the Attorney General believed
                            Campbell’s decision was based on an erroneous interpretation of the law
                            which would have unconstitutional results.</note></p>

                    <p>The President expressed concern about the possible ramifications of such
                        actions and said that in any event if he did take them he would think their
                        effectiveness should be limited to January 20, the end of his term of
                        office.</p>
                    <p>I said to the President that we had tried to think of every possible
                        eventuality; that so far we had not found any practical vulnerability in the
                        concept; but that we could not in all honesty guarantee absolutely that
                        events would ensue as we envisioned them.</p>
                    <p>The President was most emphatic in his determination to uphold the
                        Constitutional principle; he was concerned about the people involved and
                        their loss of jobs. He, nevertheless, was conscious of the many other people
                        (certifying officers, disbursing officers, and others) who would be acting
                        with some degree of risk in proceeding contrary to the decision of the
                        Comptroller General.</p>
                    <p>The President had talked with the Comptroller General Friday and called him
                        again this afternoon while I was still in the office.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d271fn3">No further record of these conversations has been
                            found.</note> The President outlined the course of action he was
                        considering and said that he was calling just to say that if it were at all
                        possible he would not like to see a head-on clash between himself and the
                        Comptroller General. The upshot of the conversation was that the Comptroller
                        General said that he would call Congressman Porter Hardy, the Subcommittee
                        Chairman who made the request for documents occasioning this situation. The
                        Comptroller General advised that he would report the results of his
                        conversation with Congressman Hardy.<note n="4" xml:id="d271fn4">On December
                            23, the White House released a statement by the President certifying he

                    <p rend="center">Summary of Major Findings and Recommendations</p>
                    <p>The supply expansion programs initiated during the Korean War and the
                        stockpiles accumulated by the Government virtually eliminate the threat of
                        raw material shortages of the type that impeded past defense mobilization
                        efforts.</p>
                    <p>The $7,350,000,000 worth of strategic and critical materials in Government
                        inventories, plus production in the United States and readily accessible
                        foreign areas, with a few relatively minor exceptions could easily support
                        an expanded defense industry for several war years.</p>
                    <p>In previous wars, time and distance helped keep hostile attack from American
                        shores. This may no longer be true. The protection afforded previously by
                        ocean barriers may have vanished with the advent of new weapons and the
                        means of delivering them.</p>
                    <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0582"/>
                    <p>Raw material consuming facilities are generally more vulnerable bombing
                        targets than are raw material producing facilities and inventories. This
                        lessens the probability of serious material shortage problems in nuclear
                        war.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the need for strategic and critical materials would be greater in
                        a limited war, or in an economic or political conflict, than in a nuclear
                        war.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Survival, Relief and Rehabilitation</p>
                    <p>As nuclear attack is today a distinct possibility and threatens the very
                        survival of the American people, this nation must attain and maintain a
                        position of preparedness that is flexible, balanced and within its
                        capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Annual military expenditures now total about $40,000,000,000. In addition,
                        the Government maintains materials stockpiles and industrial facilities
                        valued at many billions of dollars to support the defense effort. Yet for
                        human survival and relief the Government has stockpiled items, principally
                        medical, amounting to only about $200,000,000.</p>
                    <p>The Committee recommends that in stockpiling, emphasis be shifted from raw
                        materials to finished items and vital supplies for survival, relief and
                        rehabilitation. Energetic steps should be taken to make coordinated studies
                        in this area and to initiate appropriate programs. (See supplementary
                        statement by Henry H. Fowler in the Appendix.)<note n="1" xml:id="d272fn1"
                            >Not printed. In this Appendix, Fowler urged early action by the
                            Executive and Legislative branches of the Federal government to get a
                            program underway and enact appropriations. While coordinated studies
                            would be useful in the long run, Fowler wanted to stress the need for
                            decisive action to initiate the program.</note></p>

                    <p>The stockpiling of materials is still a major element of any preparedness
                        program. Accordingly the Committee makes the following recommendations: <list>

                                made for major military and atomic energy programs, as well as for
                                new and increasing uses of high-temperature and other

                                North American area. Attainment of the Minimum Goals should be given
                                priority. It should be noted that application of the Greater
                                Security Goals concept to perishable materials would be an
                                enlargement of present practices.</item>

                    <p>I came into the meeting about fifteen minutes after it had started. There
                        seemed to be general agreement that the voluntary plan for limiting the
                        importing of oil was about to break down. This was due to two factors—(1)
                        the unwillingness of Tidewater Oil to cooperate in the voluntary plan, and
                        (2) the increasing number of new people coming into the field who wish to
                        import oil.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated that it was probable that some system of mandatory
                        import controls would have to be worked out and put into effect. He
                        suggested two or three ways of doing this, and asked Secretary <persName

                        Committee, to consider these suggestion along with others.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> said that the Cabinet
                        Committee had had this problem under constant review, and would hold another

                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> opened the meeting by
                        generally reviewing the situation. He was followed by Captain Carson who
                        gave a summary of his hearings.<note n="2" xml:id="d274fn2">At the
                            recommendation of two reports of the Special Committee To Investigate
                            Crude Oil Imports, July 29 and December 12, 1957, the Voluntary Oil
                            Import Program went into effect with respect to purchases in states east
                            of the Rocky Mountains on July 29, 1957, and was extended to the
                            remaining states on December 24, 1957. The program was carried out under
                            provisions of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955 (69 Stat. 162)
                            and was administered by the Department of the Interior. Carson’s
                            hearings were apparently on the program.</note> A number of new
                        importers were requesting quotas, but by reason of the fact that demand had
                        not increased as anticipated, there was no room for them. While on the whole
                        most of the companies were going along with the program, there were three
                        importers that were very definitely out of line and this was having its
                        effect on the willingness of other importers to continue to conform to the
                        program. The situation in the domestic industry was very difficult. Oklahoma
                        had dropped its production about 10% and Texas had dropped its production
                        about 16% (9 days allowables). Louisiana had <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554"
                            facs="0586"/>also restricted production. No restrictions had been
                        imposed by California. Captain Carson thought that he could adjust the
                        program if he had an additional 40,000 to 50,000 barrels a day to allocate.
                        Chairman Weeks then posed the question as to whether any member of the
                        Committee thought the voluntary plan would work. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that the plan had been
                        working reasonably well and that there were serious security problems
                        involved in any alternative procedure. The thing that we should really do is
                        to compare the voluntary plan with the alternatives. He recalled that the
                        Department of Justice had indicated that there might be some method short of
                        mandatory controls of bringing the recalcitrants into line, and he asked the
                        representatives of Justice to discuss this point. Mr.
                            <persName>Hansen</persName> noted that any mandatory controls would be
                        extremely cumbersome. It would be necessary to afford objectors some type of
                        a hearing procedure and this would involve a large administrative staff for
                        which we had no funds available. Moreover, the objectors would probably file
                        suits in court and in the meantime the benefits of the voluntary program
                        would be lost. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> noted that
                        the success of a program should be measured by how well it is doing as
                        compared with alternatives. The voluntary program might be much better than
                        any alternative. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        again commented that it is necessary to consider the degree to which the
                        program is successful and the real question was how could it be made to work
                        better. It is possible that some reasonable additional reductions would be
                        consented to by Venezuela and Canada. At any rate, we were currently holding
                        consultations with them on that point. The Committee should very seriously
                        consider the difficulties of approaches other than a voluntary program,
                        since it would lead to a degree of socialization of the industry. We have
                        here domestic security interests and foreign security interests. Mandatory
                        controls might well lead to controls over price. It is possible that some of
                        the companies having existing allocations can move over for newcomers and
                        this after all may be temporary, for there may be an upturn in demand and it
                        may be possible to get along with the voluntary program. Chairman <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> noted that there was an existing
                        imbalance of imports and production by reason of the failure of any increase
                        in demand to develop. The small importers may be squeezed out. Unless some
                        action is taken, the extension of the Trade Agreements Act may well be
                        defeated in Congress and we had been advised to that effect by the leaders.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> again noted that there was an
                        imbalance of imports and production because of a decrease in domestic
                        demand. He suggested that the ratio be adjusted and that asphaltic crudes be
                        exempted from the program so as to give Carson in the neighborhood of 80,000
                        barrels a day as distinguished from the 200,000 barrels a day that was being
                        requested by the applicants. He commented that we cannot allow one company
                        to destroy the entire <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0587"/>system. The
                        answer was some reasonable cutback. Mr. <persName>Hoover</persName> noted
                        that there had not in fact been a large drop in domestic demand according to
                        the latest Bureau of Mines figures, although there had been some drop over a
                        period of time. Actually, the excess of production was not really due to
                        excessive imports. Factors that would have to be considered were the great
                        increase in use of natural gas; the fact that states other than Texas had
                        not cut back production substantially. The fact that we have at present
                        110,000,000 barrels above working stocks was due in his opinion to many
                        factors other than imports.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> commented that the
                        basic authority given to the President by Congress under Section 7<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d274fn3">Section 7 of the Trade Extension Act of 1955. (69
                            Stat. 162)</note> related to the national security. He had to determine
                        whether the domestic industry was reasonably healthy in the sense that there
                        was sufficient discovery and production so that our reserves did not decline
                        in terms of the number of years that they would be available. He recognized
                        that there were security interests involved also in our relations with
                        Canada and Venezuela and the Middle East. It was necessary to recognize that
                        the number of producing companies would increase and the number of importers
                        would increase. In the light of this the major concern of the big companies
                        was that there was a certain point at which they could not cut their profits
                        in the national interest unless they were forced to do so by some type of
                        mandatory control. On the other hand, the companies well recognized that a
                        voluntary plan was flexible and they had no desire for statutory controls. A
                        number of the smaller refiners in the United States were closing down. If we
                        were to have a form of mandatory control, the industry would prefer an
                        executive order to a statute. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> reverted to the point of what could be done to add
                        teeth to the voluntary program. Mr. <persName>Walsh</persName>, commenting
                        first on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>’s
                        statement, said that mandatory control through executive order was even more
                        difficult than legislation. Money would be needed to administer such a
                        program. In reply to Secretary Dulles, Mr. <persName>Walsh</persName>
                        suggested application of the Buy American Act<note n="4" xml:id="d274fn4"
                            >The Buy American Act, enacted March 3, 1933, stipulated that in all but
                            limited cases only unmanufactured articles, materials, and supplies
                            mined or produced in the United States and only manufactured articles,
                            materials, and supplies made in the United States could be acquired by
                            the government for public use. (47 Stat. 1520)</note> to those companies
                        which failed to comply with the voluntary program. In effect, they would not
                        be eligible to sell oil to the government. It was noted that such a sanction
                        might be avoided if the companies were able to segregate imported from
                        domestic oil, but it was felt that it would be rather difficult for them to
                        do so. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> inquired
                        whether it would be possible to forbid such companies from shipping their
                        oil in interstate commerce, but it was pointed out that this could only be
                        done through legislation. Judge Hansen said that <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556"
                            facs="0588"/>the Department of Justice had a memorandum<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d274fn5">Not found.</note> indicating how the Buy American Act
                        could be applied in this instance. The memorandum was premised upon the
                        theory that it would be most inconvenient for the companies to segregate
                        imported from domestic oil. There was then a general discussion of this
                        suggestion on the part of Justice, and it was agreed that Justice’s
                        memorandum would be distributed to those Departments which made large
                        purchases of petroleum products such as Defense, Post Office and <gloss
                            target="#t_GSA1">GSA</gloss>. At Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                            >Quarles</persName>’ suggestion, those Departments would study the
                        feasibility of applying this sanction so as to put some teeth into the
                        voluntary program.</p>
                    <p>The meeting then turned to the question of whether the voluntary program
                        would be adjusted to conform to the ratios between imports and production or
                        demand recommended initially by the Committee, or whether any change in
                        those ratios was required. It appeared to be the consensus of opinion that
                        these ratios had been very carefully worked out and that there was no reason
                        to change them at this time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>
                        raised the question of products such as unfinished gasoline and residual oil
                        or topped crude. After some discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                            >Gray</persName> undertook to have the situation with respect to these
                        items considered by his Committee after he had received figures on
                        categories of imports from Treasury. Some consideration was given to the
                        problem of new importers who trade their allocations with large importers in
                        exchange for crude located in the interior of the country and split with the
                        large importer the resulting price advantage. It was pointed out that this
                        was basically a refining problem. Some consideration was given to the
                        suggestion that allocations should be based on refinery capacity but it was
                        noted that this would greatly advantage the large refiners.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the meeting it was agreed that further study would be
                        given to reducing the total allocation under the voluntary programs so as
                        (a) to make the ratio between imports and production conform to the 12%
                        previously determined by the Committee to be necessary in the interests of
                        national security, and (b) to give some reasonable allocation to new
                        importers. In order to do these things it would be necessary to cut back
                        existing allocations by some reasonable percentage. Study would be given to
                        the feasibility of using the Buy American Act to bring recalcitrants under
                        the voluntary program into line.</p>

                                rend="smallcaps">Randall</hi></persName>: Enclosed is a report by
                        the Special Stockpile Advisory Committee dated January 28, 1958.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d275fn1"><ref target="#d272">Document 272</ref>.</note> One of
                        the basic recommendations of the Committee is that strategic stockpile
                        planning in general should be geared to the current concept of not acquiring
                        materials beyond the requirements for a three-year national emergency.
                        However, the Committee also concurred in the existing practice of acquiring
                        metals and minerals for the Supplemental Stockpile beyond the quantities
                        considered essential for defense purposes when they can be obtained in
                        exchange for U.S. stocks of agricultural surpluses. In this conclusion it
                        recognized the fact that such acquisitions bear no direct relationship to
                        the usual concept of stockpiling for a national emergency.</p>
                    <p>In light of the foregoing, the Committee recommended a change in the present
                        rules for determining the quantities of materials suitable for inclusion in
                        the Supplemental Stockpile. These rules, as you know, presently stipulate
                        that the amount of any strategic or critical material in the Supplemental
                        Stockpile may not exceed the lesser of (1) fifty percent of the five-year
                        long-term stockpile objective, or (2) the total five-year mobilization
                        requirement after deducting all other government-owned inventories plus
                        quantities on order. Instead of the foregoing, the Committee recommended a
                        case-by-case consideration of barter offers.<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2"
                            >This recommendation was in section II, which is not printed.</note> For
                        example, a proposed barter transaction recently submitted to the Department
                        of Agriculture involves the disposal of 50,000 bales of cotton to Spain in
                        return for a comparable value of industrial diamonds. Under the present
                        rules the amount of industrial diamonds on hand precludes such a
                        transaction.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that the present rules are derived from security
                        considerations, viz., long-term objectives and five-year mobilization
                        requirements. At the same time, the materials themselves are not considered
                        as necessary for defense purposes.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the Committee recommends, and I concur, that instead of adhering to the
                        somewhat irrelevant quasi-defense criteria which are used presently as
                        limitations on acquisitions, each proposed transaction should be evaluated
                        on its merits, i.e., what objectives, tangible or intangible, might be
                        achieved as a result thereof. I think it would be <pb n="558"
                            xml:id="pg_558" facs="0590"/>appropriate also at this time for the
                        Executive Branch to develop some concepts as to the ultimate purpose for
                        which the Supplemental Stockpile inventories might be used.</p>
                    <p>It is generally recognized that the relationship between the Supplemental
                        Stockpile and the national security is at best remote. Inventories in the
                        Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpile in most cases provide for our
                        full mobilization requirements. In many cases they exceed full mobilization
                        requirements. Acquisitions for the Supplemental Stockpile have generally
                        involved materials of which amounts needed for defense were already on hand.
                        They are in the Supplemental Stockpile essentially because the Congress
                        considered they were preferable to perishable agricultural surpluses.</p>
                    <p>It might be appropriate to weigh further Supplemental Stockpile acquisitions
                        in the light of what the needs of this country for metals and minerals might
                        be in a period twenty-five to fifty years hence. For example, it has been
                        pointed out frequently that the amount of metals consumed during the past
                        fifty years exceeds the amount consumed during the entire preceding history
                        of the world. It has been further pointed out that demand is constantly
                        increasing and will further increase as under-developed areas of the world
                        industrialize. It is axiomatic that the quantities of metals and minerals in
                        the earth’s crust are fixed. The Supplemental Stockpile of metals and
                        minerals might be given the role of providing some insurance against the
                        depletion of the natural resources of this country and of the world.</p>
                    <p>Under this concept of the ultimate purpose which this present or future
                        stockpile of metals and minerals might serve, its administration and
                        direction would appear to be compatible with the responsibilities of the
                        Department of the Interior. That Department could set up an
                        interdepartmental committee, possibly with representatives of the
                        Departments of Defense, State, Treasury, Agriculture, Commerce, the Bureau
                        of the Budget, and the Office of Defense Mobilization, to advise it as to
                        the types of objectives that might be achieved by the use of barter, e.g.,
                        preclusive buying, strengthening international relations, assisting the
                        domestic economy, etc. This committee might also provide advice as to the
                        types of materials and quantities that should be acquired on the basis, for
                        example, of the known or estimated reserves of this country.</p>
                    <p>In light of the foregoing, I would like to commend to you the recommendations
                        of the Special Stockpile Advisory Committee and my own recommendation that
                        further study and consideration be given to a new concept as to the role
                        which the Supplemental Stockpile <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0591"
                        />should play in the future.<note n="3" xml:id="d275fn3">On March 15,

                            >Weeks</persName> recalled the steps taken last July,<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d276fn1">See <ref target="#d274fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                274</ref>.</note> then stated that the situation had become more
                        complicated because of noncompliance principally by a single company,
                        decreased demand, and the advent of new importers. He pointed out that
                        production in Texas had recently been cut to a nine-day per month basis.</p>
                    <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0592"/>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> enumerated the various
                        possibilities: (1) voluntary controls; (2) mandatory controls; (3) tariff;
                        (4) no Government action. He believed that foreign policy considerations
                        ruled out the practicality of action through tariffs.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> stated that the Subcommittee
                        had studied hardest how to make voluntary controls more effective, which
                        might be done by invoking the Buy American Act against importers who refused
                        to comply with the voluntary control program. He stated that the largest
                        Government buyers—Post Office, Defense, and <gloss target="#t_GSA1"
                            >GSA</gloss>—are studying further the actions they might take. The
                        President asked if Government contractors might also operate under a policy
                        like the Government’s Buy American policy and thus extend the range. The
                        Attorney General stated this would require study but he felt it might result
                        in a lengthy law suit before final decision. The President emphasized the
                        need for having some sanction over any ruthless company.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> made clear that the
                        Committee has yet to make a determination between mandatory controls and
                        voluntary controls. The President noted how certain producers seemed to have
                        anticipated his decision, and he asked Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> or Sec. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>
                        to set them straight as to the status of the matter.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> stated that an increase in
                        demand was not in sight, then went on to express his belief that any action
                        taken by the Administration should be by Executive Order rather than
                        legislation.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_PGWB1">Persons</persName> called attention to the
                        potential impact of the oil situation on the Trade Agreements
                        legislation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> pointed out that the nearly
                        complete compliance thus far in the voluntary agreements of last July would
                        seem to preclude any justification for changing now to mandatory controls.
                        The President again emphasized that one organization should not be allowed
                        to get away with breaking the agreements when all others complied. He added
                        that the four-day schedule for some pipelines seemed to substantiate the bad
                        position of the oil industry.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> called attention to the
                        increasing interest among Members of Congress for getting the Defense
                        Department to decrease its offshore program, a change that would be contrary
                        to statements made at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d276fn2">The <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                            16–19, 1957.</note> The President could see no merit in such a change
                        since a very great defense factor was involved through the wartime supply
                        potential, particularly in spare parts, established overseas through
                        offshore procurement.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Crude Oil Imports</hi>—The President opened the meeting by
                        inquiring of Sec. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> the status of
                        the Oil Import Committee study. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> replied that the Committee would be ready to see the
                        President early next week. The President then asked as to the character of
                        the conclusions being reached. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> said that apparently the Committee would recommend a
                        combination of the voluntary program with an addition of some leverage
                        through resort to the Buy American Act. An Executive Order by the President
                        would be recommended.<note n="1" xml:id="d277fn1">On March 27, the President
                            issued Executive Order 10761 which instructed the Federal government to
                            buy only American domestic crude petroleum or products made from any
                            product refined in the United States from such crude petroleum. For text
                            of the executive order, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
                                Current Documents, 1958,</hi> pp. 1490–1491.</note> Import volume
                        would be reduced to 713 million barrels daily for Districts I-IV in order to
                        maintain the 12% ratio in the face of reduced consumption. Also the quotas
                        would be reapportioned to allow entry of additional importers into the
                        program.</p>
                    <p>In reply to another query from the President, Sec. <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> stated he did not expect domestic production to
                        increase in the near future.</p>
                    <p>The President then asserted that if a program like this failed to work, it
                        would be necessary to at least try compulsory quotas. He again cited the
                        very low level of activity in the oil industry and reaffirmed his dislike of
                        a situation where a recalcitrant company could deviate without punishment
                        from a generally agreed program.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> opined that the voluntary
                        restriction of imports had worked about as well as could be expected, that
                        the decrease in consumption was the new factor making necessary adjustment
                        of quotas, and that many industries were experiencing difficulties. The
                        President recalled the great length of time the problem had existed and
                        expressed some reservations as to the potential effectiveness of voluntary
                        agreements for solving the problem.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> stated that the
                        Department did not object to the new policy but he wished to make clear that
                        the Buy American feature might cost Defense between $10 and $20 million
                        additional per year.</p>

                                        growth on exports of a few basic commodities, their
                                        development programs are adversely affected by large
                                        fluctuations in prices of such commodities. If necessary for
                                        political reasons, the United States should, on occasion,
                                        join in a multilateral examination of price, production, and
                                        demand trends which might help to promote readjustments
                                        between supply and demand and reduce price fluctuations.

                                that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> had called
                                attention to the fact that the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"

                                    target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> policy requires interagency
                                policy-level approval before such an agreement may be discussed with
                                a foreign nation. Neither of these points was reflected in paragraph
                                27–d, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>
                                believed that the whole subparagraph should be deleted until present
                                policy in this regard is first modified by the <gloss
                                    target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>. Accordingly, General <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that the
                                subparagraph be deleted and its substance referred to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> for action.</p>
                            <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that
                                there was a statement made, he believed, at the 1957 conference at
                                Buenos Aires which was based on the President’s approved policy with
                                respect to the problem of international commodity agreements and
                                related matters. He therefore suggested that since this statement
                                had been approved by the President, it should be inserted in NSC
                                5810 in place of the present subparagraph 27–d.</p>
                            <p>“General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> if it were not
                                possible to send the substance of this subparagraph to the <gloss

                                having jurisdiction in this field. Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he could not understand
                                why this was necessary, inasmuch as the policy statement he was
                                referring to had already been made by the President. Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> suggested that
                                decision should be delayed so that we could determine whether what
                                was said at Buenos <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0596"/>Aires on
                                this matter in 1957 continued to be what we still believed to be
                                wise policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                                said he had no intention of going beyond what we had said at Buenos
                                Aires, and handed the President a copy of the Buenos Aires
                                statement. The President then suggested that the substance of
                                subparagraph 27–d be transmitted to the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                                    >CFEP</gloss> together with Secretary Dulles’ statement made at
                                Buenos Aires. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                    >Dulles</persName> said he merely wanted to state that any
                                severe inhibition such as proposed by Treasury and Commerce in the
                                bracketed portion of subparagraph 27–d, against even considering or
                                discussing international commodity agreements with our Latin
                                American friends, would have catastrophic repercussions throughout
                                Latin America. The President agreed that this was true, but also
                                warned against the danger of price-fixing as an actual U.S. course
                                of action. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                                also expressed great concern about the problem, but likewise agreed
                                that we could not certainly state that we would not even discuss it
                                with our Latin American neighbors. The President added that extreme
                                care must be taken with regard to the wording of the policy guidance
                                on this problem.” (Eisenhower Library, <persName corresp="#p_WAC1"

                        Council on Foreign Economic Policy for a review of existing policy on

                    <p>At its meeting on May 20, the Council on Foreign Economic Policy took up
                        consideration of U.S. participation in commodity agreements. The specific
                        issue was whether the Department of State should participate in an
                        international study group to examine coffee problems, to encourage
                        coffee-producing countries to develop sound national production and
                        marketing policies, and to recommend measures to be taken by those countries
                        to that end. While the Council on Foreign Economic Policy worried that such
                        a group might recommend an international commodity agreement as a possible
                        solution to the coffee problem, the Council approved U.S. participation in
                        the study group and possible discussion of an international commodity
                        agreement, but only as an exception to established policy. The Council also
                        urged the Department of State representatives to take every precaution <pb

                            Commodity Trade</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In 1954, the Economic and Social Council of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> established a Commission on International Commodity Trade
                        over U.S. objections. After long consideration, this Government declined to
                        participate in the Commission’s work. Despite its election to the
                        Commission, the U.S. did not send a representative and in fact did not even
                        send a formal observer. When the U.S. term of office expired in 1956, the
                        Council, on U.S. urging, failed to reelect the U.S. Even with this urging, a
                        small scattering of votes was registered for the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The United Kingdom at first participated in the work of the Commission. In
                        1956, the U.K. also withdrew. The ground for the U.K.’s withdrawal was
                        somewhat different from the reasons for our non-participation. The U.K. has
                        always been more tolerant of international commodity arrangements than we,
                        at least theoretically. Clarence Blau, who was present at the time of the
                        U.K. withdrawal, reported that this was a move dictated by the British Board
                        of Trade over Foreign Office opposition.</p>
                    <p>The failure of the U.S. to participate was stated to be the inclusion in its
                        term of reference of the task of developing “measures aiming at the
                        maintenance of a just and acceptable relationship between the prices of
                        primary commodities and the prices of manufactured goods in international
                        trade”. We took the position that this international parity provision was of
                        doubtful economic validity and practicality.</p>
                    <p>The net effect of the U.S. and U.K. non-participation has been that the
                        deliberations of the Commission have been dominated by the Soviet bloc and
                        the underdeveloped countries. Such countries as France and the Netherlands
                        have been members, but in commodity matters, they tend to take the viewpoint
                        of the underdeveloped areas. Canada is currently a member, but finds itself
                        quite isolated.</p>
                    <p>The State Department has increasingly felt that our non-participation has
                        very serious political disadvantages. In effect, this Commission provides a
                        forum for the Soviet bloc, the uncommitted countries and the Latin American
                        countries to discuss commodity problems in <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567"
                            facs="0599"/>the absence of real Western participation. The Soviet bloc
                        thus has the opportunity to score cheap propaganda victories over the
                        Western countries with the underdeveloped countries by showing sympathy for
                        the commodity problems of those countries and at the same time pointing out
                        the absence of the major Western consumers of commodities. Our absence
                        therefore can be used as an indication that despite our statements of
                        willingness to discuss commodity problems, we are not in fact prepared to do
                        so.</p>
                    <p>With the worsening of the markets for basic commodities, the State Department
                        has felt that our position of non-participation has been getting more and
                        more difficult. At the same time, the underdeveloped countries have shown an
                        increasing desire for us to participate. This has gone to the extent that
                        both Argentina and Uruguay have proposed changes in the terms of reference
                        of the <gloss target="#t_CICT1">CICT</gloss> which would remove the
                        objectionable reference to the parity principle.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances, the U.S. will be faced with the question at the
                        forthcoming meeting of the Economic and Social Council whether it is willing
                        to participate in the <gloss target="#t_CICT1">CICT</gloss> if appropriate
                        changes are made in the terms of reference of that Commission. It is the
                        State Department position, at the <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> level,
                        that it is politically desirable that we participate if the U.S. Delegation
                        to the 26th Session of the Economic and Social Council can negotiate
                        satisfactory changes in the terms of reference. The State Department would
                        propose that the delegation make it clear that this represents no basic
                        change in our policy with respect to commodities but merely an
                        implementation of our often repeated statement that we are willing to
                        discuss commodity questions with other countries.</p>
                    <p>While we ordinarily do not look behind State Department political views, I
                        should say that Clarence Blau, who has attended <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> meetings for a number of years, has been reporting to us
                        for two years that he feels that our position vis-à-vis the <gloss
                            target="#t_CICT1">CICT</gloss> is becoming increasingly untenable
                        politically. He has also reported to me that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
                        representative to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has made remarks to
                        the same effect to him as late as this April.</p>
                    <p>Under the circumstances, I would like authority to approve the State
                        Department position. You may wish to call this matter to the attention of
                        the Secretary, inasmuch as he participated in the 1954 decision of
                        non-participation.</p>
                    <p>It may not be amiss to recall that one of the resolutions adopted at the
                        Buenos Aires meeting which you attended provided for the setting up of a
                        similar group in Latin America.<note n="1" xml:id="d281fn1">See <ref
                                target="#d279">Document 279</ref>.</note> The U.S. joined in that
                            <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0600"/>resolution and has participated
                        in the commodity discussions in that group. We would interpret the
                        participation in <gloss target="#t_CICT1">CICT</gloss> as doing on a <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> basis what we have already agreed to do on a
                        Latin American basis.</p>
                    <p>Since this matter must be finally decided within the next week or two, I
                        should appreciate your early attention to this question.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d281fn2">At the 26th Session of the U.N. Economic and Social
                            Council, held at Geneva, July 1–31, the U.N. Commission on International
                            Commodity Trade was reconstituted with new terms of reference and new
                            membership, including the United States and the United Kingdom. The new
                            terms of reference emphasized primarily study and analysis of
                            international commodity trade rather than its former main responsibility
                            of attempting to avoid excessive price fluctuation in commodities and
                            maintaining a “just and equitable relationship” between primary
                            commodities and manufactured goods. The U.S. representative to the
                            Council emphasized that U.S. membership was under the new, broader terms
                            of reference and in no way altered U.S. opposition to international
                            commodity agreements. (<hi rend="italic">U.S. Participation in the

                        unresolved when the Council last discussed it in connection with Paragraph
                        27–d of our new Basic National Security Policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5810/1), at the Council meeting on May 1, 1958. He pointed
                        out that on this occasion the issue had been referred to the Council on
                        Foreign Economic Policy. On May 22, 1958 the Chairman of the <gloss

                            >Randall</persName>, had filed a report with the Council giving the text
                        of existing <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> policy on international
                        commodity agreements and also the consensus of the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> that this policy remained valid and should be continued in
                        effect. (A copy of General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s
                        briefing note is filed in the Minutes of the Meeting and another copy is

                    <p>At the conclusion of General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s
                        briefing, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated
                        that he had an observation to make with respect to the text of our policy in
                        the matter of commodity agreements. He pointed out that the text of our
                        policy as formulated by the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> revealed
                        two different emphases. The first paragraph which reads as follows: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The United States shares the concern of other nations about the
                                problems arising from commodity price and market instability and is
                                prepared to discuss and explore with other governments possible
                                approaches to these problems”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">according to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> emphasized the willingness of the United States at
                        least to discuss and explore approaches to these problems. On the other
                        hand, the last paragraph of our policy reading as follows: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Representatives of the United States will not participate in any
                                discussion or meeting with respect to an international commodity

                        </quote></p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">appeared to have a somewhat conflicting emphasis. It seemed
                        quite possible to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        that the discussions authorized by the first paragraph could lead to a
                        commodity agreement in which other nations than the U.S. would participate.
                        A current example is that of coffee. Under existing world economic
                        conditions, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt
                        that we would want to be sure that the first paragraph of this policy <pb
                            n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0602"/>was liberally interpreted when it
                        was implemented although of course we would not agree to actual U.S.
                        participation in any commodity agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> said he not only
                        understood Secretary Dulles’s point but agreed with him. Indeed this
                        specific matter had been discussed at great length by the <gloss
                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>. The general view in the <gloss
                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> was that the U.S. should go ahead and
                        discuss commodity problems with other nations as much as they desired but
                        not to the point of sticking our necks out too far and being committed to
                        participation in an international commodity agreement. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> thought it was extremely difficult
                        to express in words the sensitive emphases that both he and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> were agreed upon. It was
                        hard to draw so fine a line.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he believed that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> was on the right track.
                        Under current conditions the U.S. simply could not hold itself aloof from
                        these problems of commodity price and market instability as we had been in a
                        position to do when our policy on this subject had first been adopted and
                        when commodity prices were relatively high.</p>

                        concerning <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Clarence Randall</persName>’s
                        proposal for the President to delegate to the Secretary of Agriculture the
                        responsibility for determining the materials for which surplus agricultural
                        commodities are to be bartered.<note n="2" xml:id="d284fn2"><persName

                    <p>The President said that he was aware that the Congress intended that a
                        reasonable amount of barter be conducted and that he thought Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>’s proposal was the best means for
                        doing this. However, before approving Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName>’s proposal, he wanted to be sure: (1) that the
                        Congress had no objection to the delegation of this authority to the
                        Secretary of Agriculture; (2) that the Secretary of Agriculture <pb n="573"
                            xml:id="pg_573" facs="0605"/>had no objection to the proposal; and (3)
                        that the interested agencies would have an opportunity to appeal to the
                        White House if they disagreed with the Secretary of Agriculture in
                        administering this responsibility.</p>
                    <p>On the first point, I informed the President that the Congress would have no
                        objection to this responsibility being delegated to the Secretary of
                        Agriculture. I told the President that Mr. <persName>Harker</persName>
                        Stanton, Counsel of the Senate Agricultural Committee, had advised the White
                        House on September 26 that he did not see any reason why under the language
                        of the law the Secretary of Agriculture could not be delegated this
                        responsibility. In this connection, see the attached memorandum from Paul
                        Cullen to me, dated September 26, 1958 (Incl. 4).<note n="3"

                    <p>On the second point, I informed the President that I had been assured by
                        Assistant Secretary Marvin McLain, who is Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName>’s assistant for barter operations,
                        that the Secretary of Agriculture will go along with the delegation of this
                        responsibility to him if that is what the President wanted (Incl. 3).<note

                                rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> I also told the President that the

                            >OCDM</gloss> had approved Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName>’s proposal.</p>
                    <p>On the third point, I informed the President that pursuant to a
                        recommendation of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy last May,<note
                            n="5" xml:id="d284fn5">See <ref target="#d280fn1">footnote 1, Document
                                280</ref>.</note> the Secretary of Agriculture established an
                        interdepartmental committee to advise him concerning barter operations. The
                        arrangements provide for the referral to the White House of disagreements on
                        matters considered by the committee.</p>
                    <p>In view of the above, the President said that an Executive Order should be
                        prepared immediately, delegating to the Secretary of Agriculture the
                        responsibility for determining the materials to be acquired through barter.
                        He further said he thought the Executive Order should provide for interested
                        agency coordination and referral of any disagreements to the White House
                            (<gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>) for decision.</p>

                    <p>The Bureau of the Budget is preparing a proposed answer to Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName>’s letter to the President
                        (Incl. 1).<note n="6" xml:id="d284fn6">Not printed. In the letter, November
                            11, Eisenhower provided <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName>
                            with authority to acquire certain materials through barter of surplus
                            agricultural commodities and provided Benson authority to procure other
                            strategic and critical materials from time to time by the order of the
                            Director of the Office of Civilian and Defense Mobilization. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> was instructed to “continue to
                            consult the appropriate agencies in order to assure a broad and flexible
                            consideration of the problems inherent in the program.” The President
                            stated that unless there was a net gain from the exchange, the national
                            interest did not require accumulation of commodities for which there was
                            no current or projected need. Therefore, <persName corresp="#p_BET1"
                                >Benson</persName> should continue to approve for barter only those
                            transactions which would expand total exports of surplus agricultural
                            commodities without disrupting world markets. (Eisenhower Library, White

                    <p>Dulte 2. Re oil imports Following is an excerpt from memorandum of
                        Secretary’s conversation with the President this morning: “I said I thought
                        that it would not be possible to propose a final decision on new controls on
                        oil imports in the next few days. The President recalled that several
                        representatives of the oil industry had come to see him last week with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> to explain that
                        since the inception of the voluntary restrictions on the imports of crude
                        oil, imports of semi-finished products had increased sharply from about
                        80,000 barrels a day to 380,000. The President had thought that this problem
                        could be taken care of by increases on the duties on semi-finished products,
                        he also thought that this increase could be handled quite separately from
                        the question of voluntary program on crude, which he thought could
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>I said that as the problem had been presented to me, this differentiation had
                        not been proposed. I said that I believed that any mandatory program which
                        would restrict imports of oil would involve serious questions of our
                        obligations under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and our trade
                        agreements with Venezuela, Canada and possibly others. Nonetheless I thought
                        that perhaps a separate handling of the imports of semi-finished products
                        might be possible.</p>
                    <p>At this point the President telephoned Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> in Washington. After his conversation he told me
                        that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had said we
                        would probably be in trouble as regards <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> either way, but that another possibility was that
                        importers might voluntarily limit imports of semi-finished products to 5
                        percent of their total imports. This would hold semi-finished imports down
                        to about 35,000 barrels. The President left it with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> that the latter could call me here
                        if need be to seek an acceptable program; meanwhile Mr. <persName

                            n="2" xml:id="d285fn2">According to a memorandum of a telephone

                            and nothing would be done without <persName>Dulles</persName> knowing
                            about it. (Eisenhower Library, <persName>Dulles</persName> Papers,

                        possibilities we had discussed.</p>
                    <p>The President emphasized that unless the Executive takes some action,
                        Congress will, and there is some doubt that if he were to veto new
                        legislation, the veto would be upheld. I expressed my agreement as to the
                        urgency of doing something effective.”</p>

                    <p>Thereupon, you appointed the Special Committee to investigate Crude Oil
                        Imports and directed it to undertake an investigation to determine the
                        facts. On July 29, 1957, the Committee confirmed Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s certification in a special report and
                        recommended the development of a voluntary program to limit crude oil

                    <p>On May 28, 1958, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> wrote you to
                        say that he concurred in the judgment of the Special Committee that it was
                        necessary for the Committee to have cognizance of all aspects of the matter
                        of the importation of petroleum and its products, in order that the
                        Committee might guard against circumvention of the voluntary program through
                        the importation of products.<note n="5" xml:id="d286fn5">Not found.</note>
                        Accordingly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> advised you that
                        his original certification of April 23, 1958, required cognizance of the
                        whole field of petroleum and its products and recommended that you instruct
                        the Special Committee to govern itself accordingly.</p>
                    <p>You instructed the Committee to proceed along those lines and, since then,
                        the revised national security clause (Section 8 of the 1958 Extension Act),
                        through use of the phrase “... imports of such article and its derivatives
                        ... “<note n="6" xml:id="d286fn6">Ellipses in the source text.</note> has
                        supported the view that the Special Committee should have cognizance of all
                        aspects of the importation of petroleum and petroleum products.</p>
                    <p>In view of Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName>’s
                        request, I have felt it proper to review the factors which influenced Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s original conclusions and
                        your responses to them. In the light of this background, and as provided for
                        in Section 8 of the 1958 Extension Act, I have also conducted an
                        investigation which I deem appropriate in order to determine the current oil
                        import situation as it is related to the national security.</p>
                    <p>In the course of this investigation, I have sought information and advice
                        from other appropriate Departments and Agencies. Likewise, I have given
                        consideration to the relevant factors set forth in Section 8. Finally, I
                        have examined the trend of past imports, the current situation and such
                        projections as are available. As to such projections, I have also weighed
                        the potential consequences of a termination of the voluntary program which
                        has been in effect since Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s
                        original certification.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of the foregoing, in response to Under Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName>’s request, I do hereby advise you,
                        pursuant to Section 8 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1958, that in
                        my opinion crude oil <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0609"/>would be
                        imported into the United States in such quantities or under such
                        circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security, if it were not
                        for action to limit crude oil imports. I believe also, as did Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, that the certification with respect to
                        crude oil requires cognizance of all aspects of the importation of petroleum
                        and petroleum products.</p>

                    <p>Commodity matters, particularly as they relate to efforts to solve chronic
                        problems of price fluctuations and market instability, have come
                        increasingly to the fore as major international economic issues.</p>
                    <p>There is considerable pressure on the U.S. for participation in various types
                        of international commodity arrangements. The question is whether in its
                        implementation present U.S. policy against participation in commodity
                        agreements is defined clearly enough to withstand such pressures while
                        avoiding the adverse effects on our international position and

                        established by the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> on October 25,

                        policy statement, the U.S. has avoided involvement in any new international
                        commodity agreements. However, U.S. representatives have participated in
                        international discussions of commodity problems covering coffee, cocoa,
                        sugar, wheat, rubber, copper, lead and zinc. The U.S. at the <gloss

                        revised terms of reference.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, the impression has been widely held abroad that the U.S. is
                        disinterested in commodity problems of the less developed countries. Our
                        attempts to remove this erroneous impression have unfortunately led to the
                        equally erroneous impression that we are willing seriously to entertain
                        commodity agreement proposals.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">III. Conclusions</hi></p>
                    <p>The basic statement of U.S. policy set forth in October 1955 continues to be
                        a sound approach for the U.S. to maintain in relation to international
                        commodity problems. Under that policy it should be possible for the U.S. to
                        participate in international commodity discussions without compromising the
                        basic U.S. position. In the course of such participation, we should
                        emphasize in more positive terms the validity of the U.S. position.</p>
                    <p>The following guidelines are proposed for implementing the U.S. policy with
                        respect to U.S. participation in international commodity discussion: <list>

                            <item>Stress a willingness to exchange information about developments in

                            <item>Encourage studies of means of expanding consumption of the

                            <item>Encourage examination of, and attention to, the more fundamental
                                causes of commodity instability including undue economic reliance by
                                some producer nations on single commodities, unsound monetary
                                policies, etc.</item>

                                connection, reference should be made to the fact that the U.S. has
                                not been successful in eliminating agricultural surplus despite
                                massive attempts at crop “management” through price supports and

                                economic and other policy reasons U.S. participation in any

                                not in any way be construed as implying a commitment on the part of
                                the U.S. to participate in an international commodity

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> had a relatively successful
                        talk with the Venezuelan and Canadian representatives here in Washington
                        regarding the imposition of mandatory country import quotas. Both the
                        Venezuelan and Canadian representatives said they would recommend our
                        proposal to their governments, but both of them said no final decision could
                        be had for internal political reasons until some time in the New Year.
                        Therefore, it was decided to go ahead and make a modified version of <pb
                            n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0612"/>the present system mandatory on a
                        temporary basis as of the first of the year, and allow State a reasonable
                        period of time to reach agreement with the Canadian and Venezuelan
                        governments on the permanent solution involving country import quotas.</p>
                    <p>Late yesterday Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName>
                        informed Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> that he had
                        had second thoughts about this and felt that there should be no more
                        conversations with Venezuela and Canada, and that after issuing a temporary
                        mandatory order as of the first of January the whole matter should be thrown
                        into the laps of the Congress for their decision. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> indicated he still favored the
                        solution of a cost compensating import excise tax which would equalize the
                        cost of foreign oil at American ports with a heavier tax on the cheaper oils
                        from the Middle East. If he has not already done so I assume that he will be
                        talking to the President along these lines some time in the near future.</p>
                    <p>It would be most helpful if you could say a word to the President about the
                        extreme difficulties which would be posed by the adoption of this principle,
                        i.e., the drive to extend the same principle to Japanese imports.<note n="1"

                            CANADA</p>
                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Present System of Controls</hi></p>
                        <p>1. The present system of voluntary control of imports was instituted in
                            July 1957 with respect to crude oil and was extended in March 1958 to
                            certain petroleum products. The controls were framed in terms, not of
                            Canada or any other supplying country, but of importing companies and
                            U.S. areas. The quota of each importing company was fixed on a
                            historical basis, i.e., in relation to its past imports during a stated
                            period.</p>
                        <p>2. The rationale for the imposition of controls was that the level of oil
                            imports was such as to threaten to impair the national security. Section
                            7 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d289fn4">See <ref target="#d286fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    286</ref>.</note> authorized the President to adjust the level
                            of imports in the event of such a finding.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Effect of Present Controls on Canadian
                                Production</hi></p>
                        <p>3. So far as concerns Canadian oil, these import restrictions have not
                            yet become a limiting factor on imports, due in part to the effect of
                            the recession on expected demand. Nevertheless, under the present
                            program because of price considerations the trend of imports has been in
                            favor of Middle East and Far East oil sources to the detriment of <pb
                                n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0614"/>Western Hemisphere sources.
                            Thus, while quotas under the voluntary system of firms which normally
                            import from Canada are currently 138,000 b/d (a figure substantially
                            below the high point of 209,000 b/d reached in April 1957 during the
                            Suez crisis), actual imports from Canada in CY 1958 are expected to
                            average 80–90,000 b/d.<note n="5" xml:id="d289fn5">The tables on page 8
                                show U.S. oil imports, 1954–58. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note></p>
                        <p>4. However, these restrictions can be expected to limit the import of
                            Canadian oil when and if demand increases above the allowables and, in
                            any case, may well have an important effect on the future development of
                            Canadian oil. The present permissible import levels would not be high
                            enough to stimulate exploration and development of Canadian
                            resources.</p>
                        <p>5. Canadians consider that the most economic and effective development of
                            their oil resources depends on assured access to their natural market in
                            the Northwestern and North Central United States. Canadians believe
                            their oil deserves, and should have, on security grounds, a preferential
                            position in the United States relative to other imported oil. They
                            regard the application of the U.S. import control system to importers
                            from Canada as a sign that Canada will not have such a position in the
                            U. S. market.</p>
                        <p>6. The prospect that the continuing need for U.S. quotas may affect
                            normal growth of the U.S. market for Canadian oil is one of the factors
                            in Canada’s current consideration of whether to provide an additional
                            outlet for Western Canadian crude through construction of pipelines to
                            the Montreal market. Such action by Canada would have the collateral
                            effect of curtailing the present substantial market for Venezuelan crude
                            in Eastern Canada, with detrimental effect on the development of
                            additional reserves in the Western Hemisphere outside of North
                            America.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Proposed Revision of Controls</hi></p>
                        <p>7. The President’s Special Committee to Investigate Crude Oil Imports is
                            currently considering a revision of the present import control system.
                            What effects this revision will have on imports from Canada and the rest
                            of the Western Hemisphere will depend on the weight given to Canadian
                            and other Western Hemisphere resources in the interest of national
                            security.</p>

                            Committee, in developing the import control program, did not approach
                            the problem from a Western Hemisphere or Canadian viewpoint but equated
                            national security with domestic production.</p>

                                Import Restrictions on Canadian Oil</hi></p>
                        <p>10. a. Restrictions on the importation of Canadian oil are contradictory
                            to the long-standing plan of the United States and Canada to share their
                            resources in time of war on a continental rather than on a national
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>b. Increased Canadian and other Western Hemisphere oil resources, the
                            development of which U.S. import restrictions tend to inhibit, would be
                            essential in certain emergency situations as a supplement to U.S.
                            resources. For example, because petroleum and petroleum products are
                            expected to be limiting factors in the survival and recovery of the
                            United States in the event of an attack on the continental United
                            States, the immediate and continuing availability in neighboring
                            countries of maximum supplies would be in the interest of national
                            security.</p>
                        <p>c. Such increased resources would lessen the political leverage and
                            economic impact on Free World security of the denial or interruption of
                            Middle East oil. While preferences for the development of Western
                            Hemisphere (dollar) oil would adversely affect the import of non-dollar
                            oil from areas outside the Middle East (e.g., the Far East), in <pb
                                n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0616"/>comparison with the adverse
                            impact which the import control program has on foreign oil development,
                            the effect of a preference for Canada and Venezuela would be small.</p>
                        <p>d. Although U.S. import quotas will not force Canada to provide access to
                            Montreal market for Western Canadian crude, such access would tend to
                            deny that market to Venezuela oil and thus adversely affect the
                            development of oil sources in Venezuela. The economic effect on
                            Venezuela of the loss of the Canadian market would be most serious and
                            it is likely that the United States would be blamed.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Arguments Against Eliminating or
                                Reducing Import Restrictions on Canadian Oil</hi></p>
                        <p>11. a. A preference for Canadian oil imports would conflict with our
                            general policy of non-discrimination among country sources and might
                            create serious foreign relations difficulties, both in connection with
                            our trade policy and in the broad economic and political field. However,
                            special treatment of the imports of countries of a given area appears
                            not to violate our obligations under <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> when the exception is “necessary for the protection of
                            its (the United States’) essential security interests in time of war or
                            other emergency in international relations”. It must be admitted that,
                            were the exception applied to Canadian imports only, it is probable that
                            under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> or under our bilateral trade
                            agreement with Venezuela such preferential treatment would be
                            challenged.</p>
                        <p>b. In view of the state-imposed controls on oil production in the United
                            States, the removal of all restrictions on oil imports from Canada would
                            tend to give to Canadian producers a preferred position, as against U.S.
                            producers, in the U.S. market.</p>

                        <item>The question before the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> is
                            whether any foreign economic policy reasons override the national
                            security reasons outlined in the Planning Board paper with respect to
                            giving preferential treatment to oil imports from Canada and Western

                            that oil imports must be restricted for national security reasons, this
                            finding having been duly made and recently reaffirmed by the Director of

                        <item>The burden of the Planning Board paper is that Canadian and Western
                            Hemisphere oil should be given preferential treatment. Among the reasons
                            for the conclusion are: (1) Canadian oil can be delivered to the United
                            States by pipeline, unlike oil from other sources which would employ
                            vulnerable sea transportation; (2) restrictions on Canadian oil would be
                            contrary to the U.S.-Canadian plan to share resources in time of war;
                            (3) Canada’s oil exports to the United States should be large enough to
                            stimulate Canadian oil exploration and development; (4) failure to give
                            preferential treatment may force Canada to build an east-west pipeline
                            which would result in reducing its Venezuelan imports; and (5) the
                            greater availability of Canadian and Western Hemisphere oil would reduce
                            Free World reliance on Middle East oil.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The Planning Board recognizes that any discriminatory import treatment
                            accorded Canadian and Western Hemisphere oil would be contrary to U.S.

                            reasons is authorized both by the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                            and by the Venezuelan bilateral trade agreement.</item>

                        <item>If the question before the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> were
                            whether any oil import restrictions at all should be imposed for
                            national security reasons, the problem would be much simpler. We could
                            then take the position that <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0618"/>the
                            United States would be seriously affected from a foreign economic policy

                            restrict trade. We could also urge that the cumulative effect of the
                            imposition of oil quotas and the recent U.S. action in lead and

                            losing its world leadership in trade liberalization and the beginning of
                            a backward movement towards more restrictive world trade practices. It
                            could also be urged that the Middle East and Far East oil producing
                            countries would be hurt economically, thus affecting their economic
                            growth and stability and serving to undermine other U.S. economic
                            actions to achieve this purpose. But the U.S. has already imposed
                            voluntary quotas and is expected to impose mandatory quotas in the near
                            future.</item>

                            necessary for national security.</item>

                            >Strauss</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFA1"
                            >Seaton</persName>; and the paragraph was adopted in the form shown in
                        the Action below.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> said the President’s
                        Committee on Oil Imports had yesterday recommended an extension for two
                        months of the present voluntary arrangements in the field. This action was
                        fortunate in the light of events in Venezuela. Some members of the Committee
                        questioned <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0620"/>the basic national
                        security finding on which future action is to be based. After Christmas, the
                        Committee will consider this finding and the action which should be taken
                        after expiration of the two months’ extension of voluntary arrangements.</p>
                    <p>The President felt that if we tried to give preference in oil imports to
                        Canada and Venezuela, we would find ourselves in trouble in the Middle East,
                        and in addition we would be violating a fundamental principle of U.S.
                        foreign relations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName>
                        observed that national defense considerations provided the only excuse for
                        such preferences. The President noted that the law conferred on the
                        President an arbitrary power in this field; but when the President attempts
                        to use this power, great obstacles are revealed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that there was some
                        possibility of giving preference to Venezuela without violating our
                        principles, provided a five or six year average was used in computing oil
                        imports. Venezuela had always had a large share in our oil imports, while
                        the Middle East share had only recently increased. The President wondered
                        whether preferential arrangements had not always been on a voluntary basis.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the lead and zinc
                        arrangements were not voluntary. In response to a query from the President,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> added that Canada would
                        have to be a special exception with respect to oil imports.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> pointed out that the
                        Department of Defense had a special interest in Canada and was engaged in
                        frank discussion with Canadian defense officials on U.S.-Canadian relations.
                        From the defense viewpoint, it was important to handle the problem of
                        Canadian oil properly. The Canadian oil problem was even more important than
                        the Venezuelan problem, because Canadian oil is more important to the U.S.
                        than Venezuelan oil and because Canada is more important than Venezuela in
                        the defense of the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFA1">Seaton</persName> wondered whether
                        “preference” had been defined. The President said such definition was the
                        task of the Committee.</p>
                    <p>The President then remarked that some day the Attorney General might find the
                        constitutionality of preference arrangements being tested. In case such a
                        question were raised, the fact that a national security finding like the one
                        under discussion had been adopted by the President on the advice of the
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> might help make the preference
                        arrangements constitutional.</p>

                                I’d like to ask the Council to look at the Action we have drafted to

                            adjusting and regulating imports of crude oil and its principal products
                            into the United States and creating a mandatory system of controls on

                        question, then stated that noncompliance by a few companies had tended to
                        demoralize those that did comply to the extent that some of the latter now
                        intended to withdraw from the voluntary program. He also stated that the
                        Executive Order restricting Government purchases from noncompliers had not
                        fulfilled its purpose.<note n="2" xml:id="d292fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d277fn1">footnote 1, Document 277</ref>.</note> Further
                        complicating the program were increased imports of finished petroleum
                        products and the advent of many new importers desiring to share in the
                        program. Finally, there had been some advice from the Justice Department
                        that there needed to be reference to the Anti-Trust Act should coordination
                        of the companies’ activities be extended further. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> immediately stated that Justice had
                        intended only to make clear that it could give no assurance against serious
                        litigation developing.</p>
                    <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> then noted the <gloss

                        constitute a threat to national security,<note n="3" xml:id="d292fn3">See

                        followed by Cabinet Committee recommendation of its new program which he
                        described in detail.</p>
                    <p>He concluded with the recommendation that the Cabinet Committee be discharged
                        of its responsibilities and that the Secretary of the Interior take over the
                        operation of the new mandatory program.</p>
                    <p>With regard to residual fuel oil, included for the first time in the program,
                        Adm. <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> made clear that no
                        reduction in volume was contemplated and that there would be frequent
                        opportunities for review to prevent any shortage from developing in those
                        areas dependent upon residual fuel oil. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA2"
                            >Herter</persName> set forth State Department’s serious reservation as
                        to including residual because of its heavy impact on Venezuela. He noted
                        that imports for the past few months were unusually high, above the 1957
                        level, that Mexico was coming into this picture, and that there could be
                        serious question as to whether the <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0624"
                        />defense essentiality concept could be applied to residual. He also hoped
                        that in the administration of this program a very sharp eye would be kept on
                        the price factor.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_SFA1">Seaton</persName> assured him that this
                        would be done because of its bearing on the national economy as a whole. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFA1">Seaton</persName> thought that the impact of
                        the program would be to prevent prices from falling further, thus firming
                        them up, rather than raising them—although some small increases might occur
                        in particular products. Much of this would depend on the actions of the
                        State regulatory bodies as to limitations of production.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General expected that the new program would be attacked in the
                        courts and that there would be serious problems in the defense of the
                        Government’s position. Accordingly, to facilitate this defense, he hoped
                        that the basic papers from Defense to <gloss target="#t_OCDM1">OCDM</gloss>,
                        and <gloss target="#t_OCDM1">OCDM</gloss> to the President, would be drawn
                        up with a view to making the strongest possible case. This could best
                        include, he thought, any specific estimates that the Defense Department
                        could make as to requirements, resources, etc.</p>
                    <p>The President recalled the traditional Defense Department position as to the
                        essentiality of having a strong domestic oil industry, also the fact that
                        the law specified “threatened” to injure rather than actual injury. On the
                        other hand, the President noted, there was a school of thought which held
                        that our oil resources should be conserved in peacetime by freely admitting
                        foreign oil, thus preserving necessarily limited resources for wartime.
                        However, he thought, this school must recognize in the new techniques for
                        making war that an existing healthy industry was more necessary than one
                        which could only be developed over a period of years. He felt there had to
                        be incentive for continuing exploration for new reserves.</p>
                    <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>’ suggestion,
                        Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> said he would consult
                        further with him, particularly as to the full report that is being
                        prepared.</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> foresaw possible
                        repercussions in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> where questions
                        already exist as to the full solidarity of South American support for some
                        of our positions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> noted State Department
                        efforts to explain to the Venezuelans that failure to act on the part of the
                        Administration might result in the imposition of more stringent regulations
                        by the Congress.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired as to the possibilities of some accommodation of
                        Venezuela’s needs through the way in which specific quotas are handled. Adm.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> did not see much
                        possibility of telling the oil companies what kind of oil they could import
                        or from where, since only seventeen companies are engaged in importing
                        residual oil. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> asserted
                        again that Venezuela will not be cut back except in relation to the
                        unusually high past two months.</p>
                    <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0625"/>
                    <p>The President stated his interest in the unity of the American continent, and
                        wished it were possible to act in unity with Canada on this particular
                        item.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> noted again the
                        provisions for frequent review so as to avoid hardship, then stated the
                        great expectation there is that the coal industry would force protective
                        legislation if the Administration did not include residual in the program.
                        This expectation was concurred in by the Vice President. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> again mentioned the impact on
                        Canada. Adm. <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> assured there
                        would be no damage to Canada since the 1957 levels were being retained. He
                        pointed out also that Canadian oil actually profits from American oil policy
                        since it could not compete in the American market if all foreign oil were

                    <p>The President expressed his concern over the tendencies of special interests
                        in the United States to press almost irresistibly for special programs like
                        this and wool and cotton, etc., in conflict with the basic requirement on
                        the United States to promote increased trade in the world. While he did not
                        wish to be pessimistic about the nature of free government, he did want to
                        caution about the troubles that might develop from too many cases of this
                        sort.</p>

                        supplying as much as 56 percent of Europe’s requirements in 1965. The
                        relative importance of coal, however, will decline by more than fourteen

                        will be made up in part by water power and by atomic energy, the bulk will

                    <p>The decrease in surplus available in 1965 contrasted with 1960 is due
                        primarily to estimated increases in United States domestic demand which
                        would reduce excess productive capacity above anticipated production from
                        United States wells to approximately 15% from the present 30%.</p>
                    <p>9. Productive capacities of the Western Hemisphere are treated as a single
                        unit consisting primarily of the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean
                        area, including Venezuela. Surplus export capability is considered to be nil
                        from other South American countries and from the Central American area. It
                        is estimated that roughly half of emergency exports would come from the
                        United States after making allowance for some increase of United States
                        imports from Canada, and that the remainder would be supplied from the
                        Caribbean, mainly from Venezuela. The indicated volume of shipments given
                        above could be sustained for at least one year in an emergency. Although
                        rationing and other measures to restrict consumption in the Western
                        Hemisphere countries are not contemplated in this paper, substantial
                        increases in the above quantities would be possible in an extreme crisis if
                        such measures were taken—especially by the United States.</p>

                    <p>10. If the Western Hemisphere were suddenly called upon to furnish the
                        quantities mentioned in paragraph 8 and to sustain exports indefinitely at
                        that level, it would constitute a severe drain on Western <pb n="598"

                        reduction of reserves including those in the United States, (b) an
                        uneconomic expansion of producing facilities, and (c) increased product
                        prices to the United States consumer.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Tanker Availability</hi></p>
                    <p>11. Under normal conditions it is estimated that a tanker surplus of over 700
                        T–2 equivalents will be available in 1960 in excess of Free World
                        requirements. By 1965 it is assumed that this surplus will have disappeared
                        and that tankers will not be available beyond those required to meet normal
                        requirements. The position in 1965 assumes that by that date there will have
                        been scrapped those tankers which by normal commercial standards have ceased
                        to be operationally profitable, including substantially all of the United
                        States built World War II tanker fleet.</p>
                    <p>12. Under emergency conditions, and depending upon the extent that Middle
                        East oil is denied, shipments to Europe would be reduced from the Middle
                        East and increased from the Western Hemisphere. The shorter haul involved
                        would result in the utilization of fewer tankers than under normal
                        conditions. Under these conditions the limiting factor would be the
                        availability of oil and not a shortage of tankers.</p>

                    <p>13. Recommendations for additional measures to decrease reliance on Middle
                        East oil can be developed in the light of the situation which would exist in
                        the absence of such measures. In examining each of the three cases which
                        follow, it is assumed (a) that Western Hemisphere oil will be available in
                        the quantities stated in paragraph 8, and (b) that tanker availability will
                        be that given in paragraph 11. The three cases are: <list>

                                fully met both in 1960 and in 1965 by reorganizing the pattern of
                                supply sources to Free Europe. This reorganization in 1960 would
                                involve routing the bulk of Europe’s requirements around the Cape of
                                Good Hope as only limited supplies would be required from the
                                Western Hemisphere; in 1965 however, because of tanker limitations
                                Europe will draw on the Western Hemisphere for maximum
                                availabilities, routing only about one quarter of its requirements
                                around the Cape of Good Hope. (See Appendix 2) North Africa and
                                Communist Bloc oil are assumed to be available in this case.</item>

                                Middle East, North Africa, and Communist Bloc sources were
                                unavailable, Free Europe’s supply level after drawing on available

                                measures discussed in paragraph 15 would be 69% and 59% of normal
                                respectively, in 1960 and 1965. Of the above sources assumed to be

                                demand in 1960 and 74% in 1965. (See Appendix 3) These estimates are

                                become 94% and 98% respectively. (See Appendix 4) These estimates

                    <p>15. The percentages cited in Cases II and III assume a lapse of sufficient
                        time to realize the full effect of emergency actions, in particular the
                        making available of Western Hemisphere oil. During the first months, not
                        more than five, there might be a brief period when Europe’s shortfall would
                        be greater than indicated above. During the first two weeks of an emergency,
                        loaded tankers already at sea West of Suez would continue to arrive at
                        European destinations from the Middle East at normal rates. It is expected
                        that European countries would then begin to draw down on stocks which now in
                        total average about 60 days normal commercial requirements of which at least
                        half would be available in an emergency. Past experience indicates that the
                        oil industry would act at once to reschedule tankers without waiting for
                        direction from Government-Industry Committees. Accordingly, the arrival of
                        emergency shipments from the Western Hemisphere would start during the
                        second month and would increase from then on until maximum efficiencies are
                        attained. This analysis of phasing represents a conservative estimate from
                        the logistics standpoint of the expected flow of oil to Europe.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Non-logistic Considerations</hi></p>
                    <p>16. The discussion thus far does not consider non-operational and
                        non-logistical problems which might affect adversely deliveries in the first
                        months of an emergency. In this paper it is assumed that cutbacks will be
                        shared ratably between Europe and other areas of the Eastern Hemisphere. But
                        whereas the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> could allocate oil in
                        Europe, no inter-governmental machinery exists elsewhere in the Eastern
                        Hemisphere. Negotiations to persuade these non-European governments to
                        cooperate with the West could be time-consuming and might fall far short of
                        success. While they were in progress (or even thereafter, in the event of
                        their failure) it might prove necessary or expedient to divert to areas
                        outside Western Europe part of the oil being made available on an emergency
                        basis from the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>17. Other difficult problems of a non-logistic nature exist. Important among
                        these is the difficulty of securing agreement among the affected Western
                        Governments that a crisis exists and that emergency action is necessary.
                        Inability to reach such an agreement would delay <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601"
                            facs="0633"/>increases in production both here and abroad and the
                        imposition of rationing measures in consuming countries. Also companies
                        might have difficulty in altering contracts for deliveries East of Suez.</p>
                    <p>18. The cumulative impact of these factors suggests the wisdom of allowing
                        three months to meet initial rates given in paragraph 8 and six months to
                        meet the maximum rates. On this basis, the levels of supply for Western
                        Europe during the first six months would be substantially below those shown
                        under Cases II and III in paragraph 13.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Effect of Reduced Availability</hi></p>
                    <p>19. The importance of oil to the energy requirements of Free Europe is
                        growing, particularly in relation to basic industry and essential services.
                        However, in the event of an emergency, it is considered that European
                        requirements could be cut back by at least 10 percent without any
                        appreciable effect on industrial production or employment and that if the
                        cut back were increased to 15 percent the probable consequences would not be
                        severe. Since oil will represent about 30% of Europe’s total energy supplies
                        during the early sixties, a 10 percent cut back in oil could reduce over-all
                        energy availabilities by about 3 percent.</p>
                    <p>20. Of the three cases the most serious from the viewpoint of internal
                        economic effects of energy shortages is Case II both in 1960 and 1965. The
                        deficit in Case II under complete denial of North African and Soviet oil, in
                        addition to all the Middle East, would be about 30 and 40% of normal
                        requirements in 1960 and 1965 respectively. The overall energy deficit could
                        be in the range of 8 to 13%, a deficiency that would contribute
                        significantly to a decline of industrial production in a number of
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>21. Case I and Case III would pose less serious problems. The oil shortfall
                        in Case I amounting to nil in 1960 and in 1965, and in Case III ranging in
                        the absence of North African and Soviet oil from about 12 to 16% in 1960 and
                        1965 respectively, cannot be expected to cause an appreciable reduction in
                        economic activity. However, even a small reduction in economic activity
                        should be measured against the rate of growth that otherwise might be
                        maintained. Moreover, during the early months of a crisis the level of oil
                        supply will be lower until emergency measures have been completed. Oil from
                        North Africa, if available, would materially improve the supply picture as
                        would oil from the Communist Bloc.</p>

                    <p>22. The disruption of oil production and transit facilities in the Middle
                        East and the import of emergency supplies from the Western Hemisphere would
                        require very large additional dollar outlays by Free <pb n="602"
                            xml:id="pg_602" facs="0634"/>Europe. These added outlays are roughly
                        estimated, after emergency measures are taken, to be in the range of $1.2 to
                        $1.9 billion on an annual basis in 1960 and $1.1 to $1.4 billion in 1965.
                        During the early months of the crisis when emergency shipments from the
                        Western Hemisphere have not yet reached their peak levels, the annual rate
                        of extra dollar outlays would be smaller by several hundred million dollars.
                        These estimates are based on current oil prices and tanker rates. In a major
                        crisis, both prices and rates would undoubtedly rise.</p>
                    <p>23. The major part of the extra dollar outlays would fall upon the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and to a lesser extent on France. The
                        financial problems of these countries would be aggravated if the crisis were
                        accompanied by a loss of confidence in their currencies and pressure on
                        their foreign exchange reserves. The method by which Free Europe might meet
                        these outlays is not considered in this paper. It can be determined only
                        when the exact nature and scope of the emergency is known. The extra dollar
                        expenditures would occur primarily because of the switch from cheaper Middle
                        East oil with a low dollar element to more expensive Western Hemisphere oil
                        with a high dollar content. To pay for the emergency oil, Europe would
                        either have to expand its exports of goods and services to the Western
                        Hemisphere or be faced with an outflow of dollars or gold. But the extent to
                        which Europe’s trade can be redirected in this manner is questionable. The
                        limited convertibility measures recently taken by the European governments
                        do not materially affect the basic nature of the dollar drain that would
                        ensue as the result of an emergency.</p>

                        early completion of plans currently under study by the <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> to establish agreement on sharing of
                        supplies in <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> countries in times of
                        emergency through a Government to Government organization. The United States
                        should also resolve the legal difficulties which restrict the functioning of
                        the Foreign Petroleum Supply Committee and which cast doubt upon the prompt
                        reactivation of a Middle East Emergency Committee.</p>
                    <p>26. <hi rend="italic">Standby Plans for Rationing and Conservation of
                            Supplies in Europe</hi>. Prompt and effective rationing of oil in an
                        emergency is an inexpensive substitute for oil stockpiling. It has been
                        stated by Europeans that without advance planning as long as three months
                        might be required to make consumer rationing fully effective in Europe.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation</hi>. The United States should urge Western
                        European Governments, where appropriate, through the <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>, to take whatever advance actions may be
                        necessary to assure in an emergency prompt initiation and enforcement of
                        consumer rationing and other practicable oil conservation measures.</p>
                    <p>27. <hi rend="italic">Stockpiling</hi>. The provision of stocks in excess of
                        normal commercial requirements would cushion the effects of an oil shortage
                        and would provide time to implement emergency actions. <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> countries <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604"
                            facs="0636"/>have agreed on the need to provide one month’s emergency
                        tankage and stocks beyond the normal holdings of about 60 days. Several
                        countries have already taken steps to put into effect the <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> recommendation. The United Kingdom has
                        unilaterally decided to provide two months’ emergency stocks.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation</hi>. The United States should encourage
                        Western European Governments to support the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                            >OEEC</gloss> 30-day emergency stockpiling program.</p>
                    <p>28. <hi rend="italic">Storage</hi>. Alternatives to the provision of
                        additional conventional tankage in the form of (a) floating storage or (b)
                        salt dome cavities or underground structures do not seem to have been given
                        adequate consideration in Europe. Costs involved appear under favorable
                        conditions to be considerably less than for conventional tankage.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation</hi>. The United States should, through
                        normal channels, provide more complete information on technology and costs
                        of these methods, and encourage European Governments to utilize the
                        development of unconventional forms of storage.</p>
                    <p>29. <hi rend="italic">Transportation Facilities—Tankers</hi>. The maintenance
                        of a surplus tanker fleet through 1965 would act as a deterrent to a cut-off
                        of Middle East supplies. If the amount of available Middle East oil
                        production were greater than is assumed in Cases II or III, a tanker surplus
                        in 1965 could have the effect of (a) reducing the dollar cost to Europe by
                        providing a choice between oil sources in the light of all existing
                        conditions at the time, (b) minimizing the drain on Western Hemisphere
                        reserves, and (c) moderating the impact upon tanker rates and upon the
                        Western Hemisphere price structure.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation</hi>. The United States should indicate to
                        European Governments the advantages resulting from (a) utilization in a
                        reserve fleet in Europe of serviceable but obsolescent tankers not only to
                        provide additional (floating) storage as mentioned in paragraph 28, above,
                        but also to slow down the high rate of tanker scrapping that is expected
                        during the early and middle nineteen sixties, thus keeping in being a
                        potential fleet in excess of normal requirements, (b) maintenance of surplus
                        operational tankers by such measures as operating at reduced speeds or on
                        uneconomical routes, or for the transportation of unconventional cargoes,
                        and (c) moth-balling of surplus tankers.</p>
                    <p>The United States should also continue its present policy regarding
                        maintenance of a moth-balled tanker fleet.</p>
                    <p>30. <hi rend="italic">Transportation Facilities—Pipelines</hi>. Two 24-inch
                        pipelines each with a potential carrying capacity of 300,000 b/d or more are
                        presently being constructed or definitely planned from the Sahara to <pb
                            n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0637"/>the Mediterranean Coast. The secure
                        operation of these North Africa pipelines would add a considerable insurance
                        factor to Europe’s supply position.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation</hi>. The United States should continue to
                        encourage the affected foreign governments to provide favorable conditions
                        which would assure the uninterrupted transportation of oil through these
                        pipelines.</p>
                    <p>31. <hi rend="italic">Oil Shale and Tar Sands Development</hi>. Although it
                        now appears doubtful that output from United States oil shale and Canadian
                        tar sands will become a significant alternative source before 1965, recent
                        developments include plans for testing the practicability of the use of
                        nuclear bombs to improve mining techniques, and thus produce economical
                        substitutes for crude oil. Capability to produce oil in significant amounts
                        from United States oil shale would add significantly to available
                        reserves.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation</hi>. The United States should (a) continue
                        its active research program to solve shale oil refining and extraction
                        problems, (b) encourage private enterprise to solve such problems, and (c)
                        if requested, cooperate with Canada in solving similar problems relating to
                        tar sands.</p>
                    <p>32. <hi rend="italic">Natural Gas Development</hi>. Experiments have been
                        nearly completed with the present trial run of the S.S. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Methane Power</hi> to test the technical and economic feasibility of
                        shipping liquefied natural gas by tanker. This revolutionary development
                        appears to hold great promise of making possible for the first time,
                        shipment of natural gas by sea. Great reserves of natural gas are now
                        available in Venezuela and in North Africa that may be utilized as a new
                        source of energy for Europe and that may provide a significant further
                        easing of Europe’s supply position. Authorities in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are participating in and are alive to the
                        economic potentialities of this project that has excited active interest
                        also in France and Europe generally.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation</hi>. The United States should follow

                        reaction gives great promise of becoming an important source of power and
                        may tend, perhaps by 1970, to stabilize Europe’s imports of oil by
                        offsetting Europe’s growing energy requirements. By 1965, as shown in Table
                        I, nuclear energy will grow in importance although at a rate less than the
                        increase of total requirements.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Copper Stockpile</hi>—Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HLA1"
                            >Hoegh</persName> reviewed the situation of the Strategic and Critical
                        Stockpile and also the Defense Production Stockpile as regards copper. He
                        posed the question of whether it were desirable at the present time to
                        dispose of 129,000 tons of copper surplus to the Defense Production
                        Stockpile. The governing policy exists, he said, that there should be no
                        action taken adverse to the national economy. He noted that it had been
                        necessary for him to make a statement the preceding week that the
                        Administration policy was to act with great care and that if any copper were
                        sold from the stockpile, the action would be gradual and careful. Gov.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> stated that his Agency
                        thought the disposal should be carried through during this period of a
                        healthy market.</p>
                    <p>There was an inconclusive discussion as to the significance of recent
                        fluctuations in the copper market.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if Defense Department still provided materials to
                        producers for certain activities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MENH1"
                            >McElroy</persName> said the possibility of utilizing some copper in
                        this way was being studied but that it would undoubtedly raise similar
                        strong objections.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> pointed to the fact that
                        some $3 or $4 billion worth of materials in the stockpile are classified as
                        excesses, hence the review of this subject as a possible means of helping
                        out in the present tight budget situation. He stated that Mr.
                            <persName>Floete</persName> believes disposal of the 129,000 tons now
                        would be in the interest of the economy by removing the threat of this
                        overhang.</p>
                    <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0639"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> spoke of the desirability of
                        getting shortened the current requirement that any proposal for disposing of
                        material for the Strategic Stockpile must lie in front of Congress for six
                        months prior to action. A shorter waiting period would help avoid “missing
                        the market.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> also suggested in connection
                        with “put” contracts that it might be cheaper merely to pay the difference
                        of $45 million between the present market price and the contract price,
                        rather than to take the materials at the full contract price.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> also noted that certain
                        government actions are being brought into line with stockpile excesses
                        rather than making purchases on the market, as for instance Treasury
                        purchases of copper for pennies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> thought that all of these
                        problems and the additional ones of barter—which merely serves to increase
                        surpluses in the stockpile—and the 3-year stockpile concept should be
                        reviewed and brought together in a Cabinet paper.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> spoke at some length of
                        various aspects of the problem and concluded that he would hesitate to sell
                        copper now, preferring to await any undue increase in the price of copper or
                        a real shortage of it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName>
                        concurred in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>’s view
                        because of the problems a present sale would occasion in our foreign
                        relations as regards Chile, Mexico and Peru. Sec. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SFA1">Seaton</persName> stated that Interior opposes sale at
                        this time, though he recognized that it was merely a matter of timing and
                        that the day must come when the government disposes of these stockpile
                        surpluses.</p>
                    <p>The President was not certain that the government should ever dispose of
                        these materials until a real need for them existed somewhere. He thought
                        things like copper were much more desirable to hold on to even than the gold
                        that is buried at Fort Knox. The reason for this, he repeated, was that the
                        supplies of these things were necessarily limited and eventually the day
                        would come when they would be very much needed. The President allowed that
                        they also might be used to defeat market speculation, such as that which
                        occurred in coffee.</p>
                    <p>The President reaffirmed his favor for bartering perishable materials for
                        nonperishable. The latter could be considered as money in the bank. Sec.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFA1">Seaton</persName> agreed that he would be
                        happy to see them retained if it were possible to remove the threat of
                        overhang.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SRJ1">Saulnier</persName> recalled the government’s
                        interest in directing its actions against inflation and he favored a limited
                        program to dispose of this copper over a 2-year period in order to moderate
                        the inevitable rise in the price of copper. As for the industry being
                        worried about the overhang, the only way to guarantee that the stockpiles
                        would be permanently locked up would be by dumping them in the ocean, <pb
                            n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0640"/>hence he favored a very close
                        appraisal of the stockpiles to see if the government could get out from
                        under by a very gradual and orderly disposal.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that there should be further study of the matter looking to a
                        full scale presentation at a later date.</p>
                    <p>Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> believed some announcement
                        ought to be made as to the present status of things. The President opposed
                        any formal announcement but was agreeable to further informal statements by
                        Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> such as he was already
                        involved in.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> urged that there be
                        discussions with the industry, if that had not already been accomplished, on
                        how to dispose of the excesses since it was possible they could be very
                        cooperative. Adm. <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> noted that
                        even copper producers are not of one view. Sec. Mitchell was anxious that
                        there be no uncertainty as to the Administration’s position, since labor
                        contract negotiations are coming up in the industry and there could be great
                        pressures upon the government to sell or not to sell should a strike
                        occur.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that if sale of this copper were to be accomplished
                        as an anti-inflationary measure then it should be done at a time when the
                        situation was much more difficult than it is now and when a major government
                        sale could have an impact instead of passing unnoticed.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> presented a proposal,<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d297fn1">The proposal became Proclamation No. 3290, April
                            30. For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current
                                Documents, 1959</hi>, pp. 1465–1467.</note> agreed on by the
                        agencies involved (with some reservations from Treasury) for the
                        liberalization of oil import restrictions presently in effect with respect
                        to Canada. We have been pressed by the Canadians for this liberalization;
                        failure to liberalize might be an added inducement for the Canadians to
                        build an uneconomic pipeline from their western oil fields to the Montreal
                        market. This would cut into Venezuelan oil shipments to Montreal and upset
                        the market generally.</p>
                    <p>The proposed liberalization, it is judged, would increase the flow of
                        Canadian oil into the United States market, chiefly into the Northwest, by
                        about 30,000 barrels a day, a modest amount.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> agreed with the
                        proposed action but pointed out that there might be objection from Alaska,
                        from our own Colorado-New Mexico suppliers and from Far Eastern
                        suppliers.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed with the proposed liberalization. He indicated the
                        desirability of an understanding with Canada to the effect that if imports
                        should loom excessively large, or if the Venezuelans should be blocked out
                        of Montreal, this would be dealt with as a new situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> discussed the proposed
                        proclamation and read a proposed press release,<note n="2" xml:id="d297fn2"
                            >The press release has not been found.</note> tentatively scheduled for
                        release on Thursday, April thirtieth.</p>
                    <p>The relationship of the proposed action to the situation in Venezuela was
                        discussed. Modification of the regulations with respect to Venezuela are in
                        prospect and are being discussed with the Venezuelans. But it will be a
                        matter of months before action can be taken.</p>
                    <p>A draft of a letter from the President to President Betancourt of Venezuela
                        was discussed. This draft was intended to allay Venezuelan disappointment
                        arising from the desire of the Venezuelans for modification of restrictions
                        against them at the time we announce modification of the Canadian curbs. The
                        President felt the draft seemed to promise more to the Venezuelans than
                        might be forthcoming. It was agreed that the letter would be redrafted.

                            >Paarlberg</persName> will work on the redraft.<note n="3"

                            Policy. The letter as sent, April 28, was transmitted in telegram 724 to
                            Caracas, April 29, and stated that the forthcoming amendment to the
                            mandatory program would improve the operation of the program and serve
                            the interests of the Western Hemisphere. The Presidential letter
                            reminded Betancourt that while the relatively small amount of Canadian
                            oil sold in the north central and northeastern United States did not
                            compete with Venezuelan oil, the amendment would reduce, the United
                            States hoped, the serious risk of a permanent loss to Venezuela of its

                        as to other sources of energy) as a means of reducing the dependence of

                            target="#t_OCDM1">OCDM</gloss> said the decision to ask for a study had
                        been made because the Middle East was in a position to exert too much
                        economic and political leverage against Western Europe; and it was
                        considered desirable to develop means to reduce this leverage. The report
                        prepared by the Interdepartmental Group suggested various means of reducing
                        this leverage. Of course, the surest means of reducing Western European
                        dependence on Middle East petroleum would be the development of alternative
                        petroleum sources in Europe and in other areas of the Free World reasonably
                        accessible to Europe. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName>
                        then summarized Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12 of the report; read the

                        in Paragraph 13 of the report; and indicated that the recommendations of the
                        report were to be found in Paragraphs 24–33. Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> said he had concurred in the report
                        and in addition had recommended that the last sentence of Paragraph 22 of
                        the Near East policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5820/1) should be
                        deleted and a new paragraph inserted reading as follows: <quote

                        the action which the Council should take. Some agencies thought that the

                        oil” while others urged that we merely “retard Western Europe’s increasing

                        draft Action began with the words “in order to reduce Western Europe’s
                        dependence on Middle East oil.” He said one of our objectives was to induce
                        countries of the Middle East to refrain from denying oil to Western Europe;
                        in his view the danger of such a denial would be minimized by a reduced
                        dependence of Western Europe on Middle Eastern oil. Finally, Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> referred to the provision
                        (in the “Note” at the end of the draft <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        Action) that the same agencies which had prepared the report would be
                        charged with the task of continuing work on the implementation of the policy
                        adopted and would make yearly progress reports to the Council.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that Governor <persName

                        had studied the report and had received written comments on it from State,

                        “Economically and politically feasible” two issues remained to be settled:
                        (1) The left-hand (<gloss target="#t_OCDM1">OCDM</gloss>, Defense, Interior,
                        Commerce) version of the draft Action reads “in order to reduce Western
                        Europe’s dependence on Middle East oil” while the right-hand (State,
                        Treasury, Budget) proposal reads “in order to retard Western Europe’s
                        increasing dependence on Middle East oil.” (2) The left-hand version
                        indicates that “the U.S. should take action” while the right-hand version
                        provides “the U.S. should continue to encourage action.” Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then called on Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the views of the
                        State Department were governed by practical considerations. Middle Eastern
                        oil was not dollar oil and was therefore more attractive to European buyers
                        than oil from other parts of the world. He thought it was not practicable to
                        seek to reduce the present degree of Western European dependence on Middle
                        East oil, but it was advisable to try to retard Western Europe’s increasing
                        dependence on Middle East oil. He wondered where the “new” oil, that is the
                        oil which would replace Middle Eastern oil, would come from. If it came from
                        the Western Hemisphere, a serious dollar problem would be created. He
                        favored the development of oil resources in such areas as North Africa but
                        did not think that the goal of reduction of Western Europe’s dependence on
                        the Middle East was possible of achievement. Therefore, he favored the word
                        “retard” in the right-hand version of the draft Action. With respect to
                        “taking action” vs “continuing to encourage action”, he felt that a great
                        deal was being done already. For example, to prevent Western Europe becoming
                        increasingly dependent on the Middle East, we were working with the
                        oil-producing countries, with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>,
                        with the oil companies in connection with the development of new sources of
                        supply, and with the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> in connection
                        with stockpiles. Without the word “continue” the draft Action would indicate
                        that we are about to embark upon some new course of action and he was not
                        aware what <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0645"/>that new course of
                        action would be. The U.S. was already taking action of the type listed in
                        the recommendations of the report by the Interdepartmental Group and would
                        continue to do so.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then said he would
                        like to turn to a specific problem for a moment. It seemed probable that
                        substantial reserves of petroleum were ready for development in Libya, but
                        the oil companies were loath to push this development too rapidly and
                        thereby jeopardize their position in the Middle East. If the left-hand
                        version of the draft <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action were adopted
                        and literally interpreted, the U.S. would be compelled to put pressure on
                        the oil companies to develop the Libyan fields immediately. A rapid
                        development of the Libyan fields would have severe repercussions in the
                        Middle East; it would for example, preclude the purchase of more oil from
                        Iran to compensate Iran for a decline in the price of oil. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought that the specific
                        problems he had just mentioned illustrated the enormous complexity of the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>The President said another factor should be taken into consideration, namely,
                        that under a system of free enterprise Western Europe would follow economic
                        rather than political impulses and would obtain oil from the Middle East as
                        long as such oil was cheaper than other oil. He thought the reduction of
                        Western European dependence on Middle East oil was an unrealistic objective.
                        We should make certain there are no obstacles to the development by private
                        companies of petroleum sources world-wide without, however, urging private
                        crash programs or adopting governmental programs for oil development. A
                        development by private companies of alternative sources of oil would
                        automatically reduce the degree of Western Europe’s dependence on the Middle
                        East. We sometimes talked about policies which would keep the U.S. petroleum
                        industry ready for expansion in case of an emergency, but we discovered at
                        the time of the Suez crisis that the Texas fields were operating only nine
                        or ten days a month and that it was difficult to step up this production
                        schedule. As long as Middle Eastern oil continues to be as cheap as it is,
                        there is probably little we can do to reduce the dependence of Western
                        Europe on the Middle East. The Libyan oil fields appeared promising, but the
                        oil industry apparently did not want a crash program for development of the
                        Libyan fields. He was not aware of any practicable thing we could do that we
                        were not already doing in connection with Western European dependence on
                        Middle East oil.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> said our objective
                        should be to reduce Western European dependence; our course of action might
                        be to continue to encourage such action as is economically and politically
                        feasible to facilitate the development of alternative petroleum sources. The
                        President agreed, but doubted that practical results would flow from stating
                            <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0646"/>that our objective is to reduce
                        Western European dependence, because Middle East oil will continue to be
                        consumed by Western Europe as long as it is the cheapest oil.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought that to
                        reduce Western European dependence was not a practical objective, but
                        inasmuch as the key language in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        Action would be the course of action language, he would not object to
                        “reduce” as an objective as long as the course of action indicated that we
                        should continue to encourage such action as is economically and politically
                        feasible to retard increasing Western European dependence on Middle East
                        oil.</p>
                    <p>The President failed to see that there was any great difference between
                        “reduce” and “retard”. Certainly in an emergency we would like to have
                        Western Europe less dependent on the Middle East than it was in 1956.
                        Perhaps our objective should be to reduce dependence and our course of
                        action should be to retard increasing dependence.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that petroleum
                        developments in Algeria were also encouraging. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> said that two large pipelines had
                        recently been constructed through Algeria to the Mediterranean and he had
                        been told that by the end of this year 600,000 barrels a day would be
                        flowing through these pipelines. The President wondered what we could do to
                        reduce dependence that would be better than these pipelines. He added that
                        he noted from the report prepared by the Interdepartmental Group that the
                        relative importance of coal as a source of energy for Western Europe was
                        declining and the relative importance of oil was increasing.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President asked whether the Libyan oil fields were being developed
                        exclusively by U.S. companies. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said Shell was interested in Libya, but that the big
                        strikes were under the control of U.S. companies. The Vice President said he
                        understood that it was our policy not to push development of the Libyan oil
                        fields. Secretary Dillon said this policy was an oil company policy, not a
                        U.S. Government policy. On the other hand, if we urged the companies to
                        develop the Libyan fields rapidly at this time, the result would be a
                        serious disturbance in the Near East. The Vice President thought the nub of
                        the matter, the immediate problem, was what to do about Libya. We had a
                        great many political problems in Libya. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that if the Libyan people were
                        fully cognizant of Libyan oil resources, they would demand their immediate
                        development. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said it
                        would not be long before they were fully informed of these oil resources.
                        The Vice President pointed out that any suggestion that the U.S. oil
                        companies are deliberately retarding the development of the Libyan oil
                        fields would be very unfortunate. The President said the oil companies were
                        not retarding the development of the Libyan oil fields unduly, inasmuch as
                        they were putting 100 million dollars into these fields at a time when
                        petroleum supplies were adequate.</p>
                    <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0647"/>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary of the Interior said that he would like a clear
                        statement that reducing Western European dependence on Middle Eastern oil is
                        U.S. policy. As one who had suffered through the Emergency Committee during
                        the Suez crisis, he felt strongly on this matter. The report prepared by the
                        Interdepartmental Group showed that most of the things that could be done
                        are already being done, but a reiteration of a policy of reducing dependence
                        would be desirable.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> said the new
                        language proposed by Governor <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName>
                        would be acceptable to Defense if it were acceptable to State. General White
                        concurred in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName>’s
                        position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> suggested that he
                        be permitted, in the light of the discussion, to work out a draft <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action. The President concurred in this
                        suggestion and added that he would accept whatever language the agencies
                        could agree on.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> felt he should inform the
                        Council that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, which had been
                        mentioned in the report, was now operating under a lessened sense of urgency
                        because of the existing excess coal supplies and the decline in the cost of
                        transporting oil and coal.</p>
                    <p>The President believed that the development of nuclear power should proceed
                        on a cautious, experimental basis. He feared that if we invested huge sums
                        of money in present processes, a breakthrough sometime in the future would
                        wipe out this investment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                        indicated that U.S. programs for the development of nuclear power were on a
                        prototype and experimental basis. He agreed there might be a break-through
                        in the future in the development of nuclear power, and added that in any
                        event there would be a gradual evolutionary development.</p>

                    <p>The domestic beet and cane, Puerto Rican, and Hawaiian sugar growers agreed
                        in December that they would join in support of an indefinite extension,

                    <p>The Department did not formulate a final view as to whether or not it would
                        support the unamended extension of the Act. The Philippines, in particular,
                        have pressed for an opportunity to participate in expanded United States
                        consumption, and have cited an undertaking by the President when he signed
                        the 1956 legislation committing the Executive Branch to give consideration
                        to the Philippine request when new amendments are being prepared. Several
                        Latin American countries have also requested increases in their quotas in
                        the United States market. Domestic refiners favor an amendment which would
                        increase foreign participation (principally Cuban) in the reallocation of
                        deficits.</p>
                    <p>Certain actions of the Castro administration after its coming into power made
                        it seem advisable in the Department’s opinion not to press ahead with
                        attempts to assure Cuba’s share of the United States market until the
                        implications of various revolutionary measures could be studied.
                        Subsequently, on May 17 a proposed Agrarian Reform law was announced in Cuba
                        and large scale expropriation of American-owned properties in Cuba appears
                        imminent. United States owners of Cuban sugar properties have urged the
                        Department to adopt a stern public posture toward the confiscatory
                        provisions of the Agrarian Reform law, suggesting that Cuba be warned that
                        the Sugar Act might be amended to Cuba’s detriment.</p>
                    <p>There have been reports in recent days that the Cuban Government plans to
                        delay for one or two years the implementation of the Agrarian Reform law as
                        it applies to sugar. These reports have not been confirmed officially by the
                        Cuban Government. The Department of Agriculture does not dispute the
                        validity of our contentions as they relate to foreign affairs. Agriculture

                    <p>Agriculture at one time favored extension of the Sugar Act this year with an
                        amendment which would empower the Secretary of Agriculture to revise foreign
                        quotas upon a finding that U.S. supplies were likely to be endangered. State
                        argued that Executive Branch sponsorship of such a provision might be
                        interpreted in Cuba and other countries in Latin America as an obvious
                        attempt to intervene in Cuban internal affairs. Agriculture has apparently
                        dropped this proposal and now suggests inclusion in the legislative history
                        of an undertaking on the part of both houses of Congress to take speedy
                        action to revise quotas if Cuban supplies decline. This approach would seem
                        also to open up possibilities of misinterpretation by Latin American
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>It should also be noted that the fears of the Department of Agriculture cited

                        assumption that enactment of sugar legislation might not take place prior to
                        January 1, 1961. Such an eventuality seems extremely unlikely in a year when
                        Congress will be adjourning early for elections. Comments on other points in

                            several fields without adequate compensation. The effect on U.S.
                            investors who might be contemplating investment abroad should also be
                            considered.</item>

                        Agriculture that the State Department would be prepared to participate in
                        the preparation <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0651"/>of the
                        Administration position on sugar legislation with a view to introduction of
                        a bill early in 1960. By that time a much fuller appraisal of political and
                        economic developments in Cuba will be possible.</p>
                    <p>Since Agriculture’s main preoccupation appears to be with future planning for
                        domestic growers, the Department might agree not to press for any change in
                        the section of the Act under which domestic areas receive 55 percent of
                        increases in consumption over 8,350,000 tons. Such an assurance should help
                        Agriculture and the domestic growers make more definite plans for the
                        future. (The Department should not at this time undertake to seek an
                        amendment to the deficit reallocation provisions.)</p>

                    <p>The Cabinet Paper and its summary present no problems for the Department.
                        They have been carefully reviewed by the Department’s representatives at a
                        series of interagency meetings, and all of the important suggestions offered
                        by us have been accepted.</p>
                    <p>The need for disposing of excess stockpile materials is more affirmatively
                        stated than in the paper approved by the Cabinet in April, 1958. However, it
                        is clearly provided that such disposals must not seriously disrupt usual
                        markets or adversely affect the international interests of the United
                        States, and that there must be prior approval of the interested agencies,
                        including the Department of State.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the proposed new legislation to achieve better coordination
                        and management of all stockpile programs, the Department has forwarded to
                        the Budget Bureau certain comments and recommended changes,<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d300fn4">Not found.</note> aimed primarily at emphasizing the
                        foreign relations aspects of stockpile disposals. There is no prospect of
                        action by Congress at this session.</p>
                    <p>The paper, in addition to containing no provisions which are objectionable
                        from the Department’s viewpoint, is more explicit than were earlier policy
                        statements in ensuring that due regard be given to the foreign relations of
                        the United States, and approval by the Cabinet would therefore seem
                        desirable.</p>

                            xml:id="d301fn1">See <ref target="#d300fn1">footnote 1, Document
                                300</ref>.</note> pointing out the history of stockpiling and
                        outlining the current situation as regards excesses. He explained that the
                        excess resulted from the reduced goals as a result of the three-year
                        concept, the change in strategical concepts, the expansion of some sources
                        of supply, and obsolescence of some materials; of a slightly different
                        nature were the excesses resulting from operations under P.L. 480. He
                        presented several charts giving the quantitative status of selected
                        materials. He pointed out that at present there are over $7 billion worth of
                        materials in the stockpile, of which $3.76 billion were for filling
                        established objectives; the remainder is excess. Under the proposed plan,
                        $4.22 billion worth would constitute objectives, leaving an excess of $2.95
                        billion.</p>
                    <p>Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> repeatedly emphasized that
                        disposal of excesses would be undertaken only if the market conditions for
                        the item were satisfactory and if disposal would not adversely affect our
                        foreign relations. He made clear that it is proposed at this time to sell
                        only natural rubber. There will be further interagency discussions prior to
                        any disposal of aluminum. As regards other minerals, the market is not in
                        satisfactory condition at this time.</p>
                    <p>Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> also stressed the
                        importance of pressing again next year the general legislation which would
                        eliminate the requirement for a six-month waiting period prior to any
                        disposal.</p>
                    <p>Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> then went over the specific
                        recommendations in the Cabinet Paper. Following this, Sec. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> inquired whether the three-year
                        requirement was based on estimates of need in an all out war. Gov. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HLA1">Hoegh</persName> said the basis was that of a
                        three-year period of emergency, not necessarily related to the duration of
                        any potential war. The President added a word about his own concern with
                        having resources at hand for accomplishing recovery in the event of nuclear
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> highly recommended approval
                        since the paper contained all the needed safeguards.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> suggested that the paper
                        be amended to eliminate the requirement that all the agencies approve each
                        disposal action—something that would be pretty cumbersome. The President
                        said that concurrence rather than approval would be satisfactory but that
                        specific agreement seemed to be needed. Mr. <persName>Flemming</persName>
                        concurred with the President’s view.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Flemming inquired whether Sec. Mitchell should be consulted because of
                        the relationship of any strike. Sec. Mitchell indicated that satisfactory
                        arrangements for this were already established.</p>
                    <p>The paper was approved.</p>

                    <p>At the 422d meeting of the National Security Council, October 29, Kenneth G.
                        Harr, Director of the Operations Coordinating Board, briefed the Council on
                        implications of recent oil discoveries in Libya. Harr estimated that by 1965
                        approximately 25,000 barrels a day would be going to Western Europe from a
                        pipeline and port being constructed in Libya by ESSO. By 1964, Libya would
                        be producing 100,000 barrels per day; by 1965, total production would be
                        300,000 barrels per day. Obviously, Harr continued, Libyan oil would be
                        strongly competitive in the Western European market. (Memorandum of

                        revisions to paragraph 60 read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“A stockpile of strategic and critical materials as authorized under
                                P.L. 520, 79th Congress, should be maintained. Objectives for the
                                strategic stockpile should be determined on the basis of the time
                                required for supplies of materials in a national emergency to match
                                essential needs of the emergency. Pending a determination of the
                                essential needs of the nation after a nuclear attack (including
                                reconstruction), the planning period should be limited to a maximum
                                of three years, provided that until such determination is made the
                                ‘maximum objective’ should not be less than six months’ usage by the

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Frank</persName> A. Kemp, acting as spokesman for the group,
                        stated that it consisted of representatives of the entire domestic sugar
                        industry with the exception of the Virgin Islands. He pointed out that the
                        domestic industry representatives have given considerable thought to the
                        problem of renewal of the Sugar Act and are meeting now in Washington to
                        decide on a position. They feel that, as Congress convenes in two months’
                        time and the session will undoubtedly be a short one, we have to arrive at a
                        position soon in anticipation of action by the Congress early in the next
                        session.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Kemp</persName> said that the industry sees only two
                        alternatives: (1) a simple extension for a short period of time—six months,
                        a year or possibly two years or (2) a longer extension—possibly 4 or 5
                        years—with <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0656"/>some modification in the
                        present terms of the law. The domestic industry has worked closely with the
                        Department in previous years on sugar legislation and it hopes that we will
                        be able to cooperate again in the same effective fashion to formulate a
                        position that will satisfy the interests of the industry and the
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRRJ1">Rubottom</persName> replied that, as many of
                        the persons present are aware, both he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1"
                            >Mann</persName> have maintained an “open door” policy and have
                        discussed this question with many of them. The Department while, of course,
                        primarily concerned with the overall interests of the U.S. welcomes the
                        views of the industry. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRRJ1">Rubottom</persName>
                        then pointed out that it has always been his firm belief that U.S.
                        businessmen and U.S. business firms abroad are one very important facet of
                        the image which foreigners have of the United States. He mentioned that he
                        has made this point on many occasions publicly, most recently in speeches at
                        Montgomery, Alabama and Dallas, Texas. He then reviewed the history of our
                        relations with Cuba since January 1 stressing that we have tried to deal
                        with Castro so that in the event of an economic or political collapse in
                        Cuba the blame can only fall on the Cubans themselves and Castro’s
                        deficiencies, and not on the United States. He emphasized that it is his
                        firm belief that foreign relations cannot be conducted on the basis of
                        expediency and must be guided by a set of principles which will give
                        continuity to our actions and policies. He mentioned that he and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> are in essential agreement
                        that we should not take any action on sugar legislation which could be
                        interpreted as punitive toward Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Kemp</persName> agreed that we must be guided by principle but
                        that “times have changed” and in today’s world some flexibility must be
                        provided, although in the case of sugar legislation he felt that it should
                        eschew politics and concern itself solely with the needs of sugar producers
                        and consumers. In this connection he stressed the need to assure an adequate
                        supply of sugar to the U.S. consumer and the desirability of some action in
                        the next session of Congress to provide such a guarantee. He then asked if
                        the Executive Branch would decline authority to adjust foreign quotas.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRRJ1">Rubottom</persName> replied that the idea of
                        giving the Executive Branch the power of adjusting quotas had been advocated
                        by a number of people and it certainly merits consideration. He pointed out,
                        however, that he was not prepared to give any indication of what the
                        Department’s position on sugar legislation will be as any such position will
                        be the product of considerable consultation by the many interested people in
                        the Department. He stated that we realize the urgency of the <pb n="625"
                            xml:id="pg_625" facs="0657"/>matter and have set November as a target
                        date for arriving at a position although we may not be able to do it that
                            soon.<note n="1" xml:id="d303fn1">In White House Staff Notes, No. 690,

                    <p>Representatives of the sugar industries of California, Hawaii and Louisiana
                        then mentioned some of the problems peculiar to their areas and stressed
                        their need to have a reasonable amount of security in the law as it takes
                        about two years to bring a crop in from the time of planting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Shields</persName> thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRRJ1"
                            >Rubottom</persName> for seeing the group and said that the meeting of
                        the industry representatives is continuing and they hope to come up with a
                        specific proposal within a short time which they then would like to present
                        to the Department.</p>

                    <p>The Sugar Act of 1948,<note n="1" xml:id="d304fn1">61 Stat. 922.</note> as
                        amended, expires December 31, 1960. As Cuba is our predominant foreign
                        supplier, consideration of recommendations to the Congress has been more
                        difficult than usual. Preliminary exchanges of views have occurred during
                        the past month with the domestic sugar industry and with the Department of
                        Agriculture. Following these meetings <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> made certain recommendations to the
                        Under Secretary as to a State Department position.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d304fn2">See attachment below.</note> The key point is a
                        recommendation that the President be given discretionary authority to adjust
                        the quotas of foreign countries should he determine this is in the national
                        interest. This would permit a reduction in <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626"
                            facs="0658"/>the Cuban quota whenever the Executive believed such action
                        was warranted. The recommendations approved by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> are attached.</p>
                    <p>In our inter-departmental discussions, the major difference that developed
                        between State and Agriculture concerned the method to be used in obtaining
                        sugar in an amount equivalent to any reduction in the Cuban quota.
                        Agriculture wanted to purchase the sugar on the world market, and take the
                        profit which would result. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        was opposed to government purchase of sugar, preferring that some other
                        method be used. At a meeting today with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD1"
                            >Paarlberg</persName> on this subject it was decided: <list>

                            <item>To ask the Congress for Presidential authority to adjust the
                                quotas of foreign countries when in the national interest or to
                                secure dependable sources of sugar for the United States. The
                                authority should be flexible enough to permit the Executive to
                                obtain sugar in any manner deemed most feasible at the time.</item>

                    <p rend="center">SUMMARY</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Sugar Act</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTD1"
                            >Morse</persName> set forth the Administration proposal for extending
                        the Sugar Act with new provisions, particularly providing some discretional
                        authority to the President. It was the consensus that the matter of quotas
                        or any general reapportionment of them should not be opened. There were
                        differences of opinion as to whether action should be taken early or later
                        in the session, but it was agreed that the Administration should proceed
                        promptly to submit its recommendations.</p>
                    <p>[Here follow summaries of other unrelated issues discussed at this
                        meeting.]</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Sugar Act</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTD1">True
                            Morse</persName> described the interest of sugar producers, refiners,
                        and consumers in accomplishing this legislation. Half of the usage, he said,
                        was commercial. He noted that action on this would normally have occurred
                        last session but had been postponed on the recommendation of State
                        Department to await developments in Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTD1">Morse</persName> then outlined the provisions
                        being recommended (see attached Fact Sheet<note n="1" xml:id="d305fn1">Not
                            found.</note>), emphasizing two things: (1) the new provision which
                        would foreclose later fulfillment of a quota after it had been declared a
                        deficit and reallocated by the Secretary; (2) a new provision whereby the
                        President could reduce the quota, for no more than one year, of any foreign
                        country except the Philippines should he determine <pb n="628"
                            xml:id="pg_628" facs="0660"/>that a shortage exists or that there is
                        need to assure the supply. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTD1">Morse</persName>
                        said that Rep. Cooley objects to the latter as a giving up of a power of the
                        Congress; however, since the power was limited to one year, the Congress
                        could act to change quotas whenever it saw fit, and the need did exist for
                        the President to be able to act at such times as Congress was not in session
                        or might find it embarrassing to deal with the issue.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired about the provisions by which 96% of any Puerto Rican
                        or Virgin Island deficit would be allocated to Cuba. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTD1">Morse</persName> said this was merely to continue
                        existing practice, and that there is a great desire not to open up the
                        matter of quotas among foreign countries in the light of the extreme
                        lobbying of 1955. Also, to open up foreign quotas would reopen the domestic
                        situation, whereas the industry is now agreeable to the proposal as it
                        stands. He noted the complication that new areas of production would add to
                        the quota question if opened up.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Halleck</persName> asked about timing. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTD1">Morse</persName> said there were differences
                        of opinion, but the matter had to be handled this session and probably
                        should not be left to the last minute. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                            >Halleck</persName> thought it might be more easily handled at the end
                        of the session. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTD1">Morse</persName> said it
                        would take quite a while to get to the Floor in any event. Sen. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WW2">Williams</persName> had doubts about awaiting the end
                        of the session. The President said this was something for the Leaders to
                        discuss and settle. It was agreed that the Administration submission should
                        be made promptly in any event.</p>
                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> said the bill would give
                        rise to great discussion of the Cuban situation when it gets to the Senate.
                        Sen. Bennett recalled that this had been handled on a bipartisan basis in
                        the past, but that Senator Ellender objects to the authorization for the
                        President, hence it should be submitted as an Administration bill this time.
                        Sen. Bennett suggested that some sort of a compromise might be possible by
                        stipulating that Congress would have power to review such a Presidential
                        determination if it were in session. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA2"
                            >Herter</persName> thought this would make the situation much more
                        difficult for the President if he ever found it necessary to use the
                        authority. Sen. Bennett continued to be interested in the possibility of
                        trying to develop some mutually agreeable language. The President thought
                        that the most important thing was to get agreement on a decent length of
                        time for which this bill would be extended, especially since there had been
                        so many comments about drastic limitation of the time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> called attention to
                        Articles 15 and 16 in the 1949 Treaty, ratified by the Senate, creating the
                        Organization of American States. These Articles denied any right of a nation
                        to intervene or threaten to intervene in the affairs of another member, and
                        also prohibited coercive economic measures. The President felt that should
                            <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0661"/>any problem arise as to Cuban
                        sugar being cut off, it could be argued that Cuba is interfering with the
                        United States economy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName>
                        hoped, in view of Article 16, that there would be no clamor in the Congress
                        for punitive measures against Castro.</p>
                    <p>Sen. Wiley noted that there were many complex questions involved, concerning
                        domestic matters as well as foreign, and inquired if these had been studied.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTD1">Morse</persName> replied affirmatively, and
                        stated that all concerned felt that the quota question should not be opened
                        up. Mr. <persName>Hoeven</persName> noted the disinclination in the House
                        Agriculture Committee to do anything more than a short-term extension in
                        view of Castro’s hostility toward the United States. He thought it might be
                        best to get a closed Rule for whatever limited bill might be reported in the
                        House, and let the Senate undertake any necessary modification. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Halleck</persName> agreed that the situation
                        would be difficult but that the Leadership would do its best.</p>
                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName> asked if this
                        constituted generally a great foreign affairs problem. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> said no, that it was much more a
                        domestic problem. He commented also that a straight one-year extension,
                        without the additional authorization to the President, would be in effect
                        helpful to Castro without accomplishing anything on domestic problems.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Byrnes</persName> thought it so desirable to avoid any great
                        controversy over this, that every effort should be made to try to work in
                        agreement with the Democrats. The President responded that a one year
                        extension merely served to keep the pot boiling and that it would keep the
                        sugar growers in doubt as to where they stood. If it were to be a one year
                        extension, there would be all the greater necessity for the special
                        authorization to the President. He hoped that Mr.
                            <persName>Hoeven</persName> could be very persuasive with his
                        colleagues.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the Leadership might announce after the meeting that the
                        Administration would submit a bill designed to meet requirements of the
                        industry and protect United States consumers. It was also agreed that
                        Administration bills should be filed simultaneously in the House and the
                        Senate even though the House must act first.</p>
                    <p>Sen. <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> asked about the
                        consumption estimate set by Agriculture for the year. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTD1">Morse</persName> said that it had been estimated—as a
                        form of insurance—at as high a level as could be justified.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President thought it might be best to secure action on this as
                        quickly as possible since the emotional trend was likely to increase. He
                        asked the Secretary of State if there was any basis for assuming that the
                        situation would improve in the near future. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA2"
                            >Herter</persName> said there was no evidence of such.</p>

                    <p>The Department of Justice has requested the advice of the National Security
                        Council concerning the national security implications of possible relief
                        directed at joint production, refining, transportation, and storage
                        companies participated in by the defendants in the international oil cartel
                        antitrust case presently being litigated by that Department. Specifically,
                        Justice has asked the Council whether national security considerations
                        suggest that Justice not seek to secure, either by negotiation or by trial
                        upon failure of negotiation, the divestiture or substantial alteration of
                        defendants’ interests in such joint companies, as well as prohibition
                        against defendants entering into similar joint companies in the future.</p>
                    <p>The complaint in the oil cartel case, instituted in 1953, charges five
                        defendant American oil companies, Standard Oil Company (N.J.) (Jersey),

                        Dutch-Shell (Shell), named as co-conspirators, but not defendants, with a
                        continuing agreement and concert of action since 1928, in violation of the
                        U. S. antitrust laws, to secure and exercise control over foreign production
                        and supplies of crude oil and petroleum products, to regulate U.S. imports

                        progress in the case and trial may be expected to begin shortly after
                        defendants produce documents from their foreign files on or before
                        September, 1960 as ordered by the Court in December, 1959.</p>
                    <p>Defendants, together with BP and Shell, have varying interests in a great
                        number of intertwined joint production, refining, transportation, storage
                        and marketing companies abroad. The oil cartel complaint charges that these
                        joint companies were used to further and carry out the alleged conspiracy to
                        restrain and monopolize U. S. foreign commerce. The principal joint
                        producing ventures are Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco) in Saudi Arabia
                        owned by Jersey, Socony, Texaco and Socal; Kuwait Oil Company (Kuwait) in
                        Kuwait, owned by Gulf and BP; and Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), owned by
                        Jersey, Socony, BP, Shell and the French Company, Compagnie Francaise
                        Petroles. The defendants, together with BP and Shell, principally through
                        joint companies, control approximately 85% of all foreign oil production.
                        The defendants alone control about 58%.</p>
                    <p>Jersey has indicated a present willingness to settle the case against it on
                        the basis of an injunction against and splitting up of joint marketing
                        abroad with any of the other defendants or BP or Shell. There is a
                        possibility that the other defendants might also offer to settle on a
                        similar basis. The Department of Justice is now faced with the decision as
                        to the scope of relief it should seek, i.e., whether to seek only the
                        split-up of joint marketing activities, or whether to seek also the split-up
                        of the joint production, refining, transportation, and storage activities.
                        Justice has not requested the advice of the Council on the question of the
                        splitting up of the joint marketing activities abroad, since it considers
                        this relief does not raise national security questions.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, the Department of State has been asked to consider the
                        possible impact of a court order requiring divestiture or substantial
                        alteration of the joint production, refining, transportation and storage
                        companies, on our foreign relations both with the countries in which the
                        joint companies have concessions and with countries whose companies (such as
                        BP and Shell) may be concerned as partners in such joint companies.</p>
                    <p>In making this request, the Department of Justice realizes that it may not be
                        possible for the Department of State to make one overall judgment as to the
                        possible foreign relations impact of a court order requiring divestiture or
                        substantial alteration of the joint companies. It is aware that the possible
                        foreign relations impact will vary depending both on the particular joint
                        companies involved and on the country or area in which they operate.</p>
                    <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0664"/>
                    <p>Moreover, Justice is not able at this time to provide detailed information as
                        to the exact forms which the remedies of divestiture or substantial
                        alteration might take in the various cases involved. Thus, in any given case
                        the relief sought might require either the sale to a single defendant of the
                        shares in the joint company owned by the other defendants, or the
                        distribution of the assets of the joint company to separate new companies,
                        each of which would be owned by a single one of the former joint owners.</p>
                    <p>Thus, in the case of a company such as Aramco, all of whose shares are owned
                        by defendants subject to the jurisdiction of the U. S. Court, the Court
                        might order three of the owners to sell all of their Aramco shares to the
                        fourth owner, or order the assets and operations of Aramco to be split up
                        between four new companies, each owned by one of the former joint owners of
                        Aramco. In the case, however, of companies such as Kuwait and IPC, in which
                        shares are owned by foreign companies over whom the U. S. Court does not
                        have jurisdiction, the only available remedy would appear to be either for
                        one of the defendants to buy out all the other shares or for all the
                        defendants to sell their shares to the foreign owner or owners, since the
                        Court could not order the foreign companies involved to divest themselves of
                        their interests.</p>
                    <p>In considering the possible impact on foreign relations of the various types
                        of relief which might be involved, you may wish to consider such factors as:
                        (1) the possibility that the split-up of the interests of the joint
                        companies might involve a renegotiation of concession agreements with
                        foreign countries, and terms which might be obtained in such cases; and (2)
                        the possible effect of the various types of relief on movements for
                        nationalization in the foreign countries in which the joint companies
                        operate.</p>
                    <p>There is attached a list of joint companies<note n="1" xml:id="d306fn1">Not
                            printed.</note> operating in the production, refining, storage and
                        transportation fields which might be affected by the relief sought in this
                        case, as well as the joint marketing companies regarding which Justice has
                        not requested any advice. These companies are listed by country of
                        operation, so that those operating within your geographical area may be
                        readily ascertained. While it is recognized that your Bureau may not in the
                        time available be able to give a full assessment of all possible foreign
                        relations considerations which might be involved if varying types of relief
                        were sought in the case of each of these joint companies, we would
                        appreciate receiving by 5 P.M. Friday, April 15 at the latest, your best
                        judgment as to the possible foreign relations impact of the above possible
                        forms of relief as applied to what you consider the most important of the
                        joint companies in your area.</p>

                        responsive to the Attorney General’s request.</p>
                    <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0666"/>
                    <p>Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> said that a
                        criminal, anti-trust action against certain oil companies had been
                        undertaken in 1952. The last act of the Truman Administration had been to
                        substitute a civil suit for a criminal prosecution in this case. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s Administration had
                        approved President Truman’s decision and consequently the Department of
                        Justice had started the civil suit. The purpose of the Department of Justice
                        inquiry now was to determine whether a decree against the defendant
                        companies limited to marketing only would be in accordance with the wishes
                        of the Council. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> thought
                        that the views expressed by the Department of State (Reference Memorandum of
                        May 2) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Reference Memorandum of May 5) were
                        valid. He wished to express his concurrence with the State and <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views and to indicate that the draft Record
                        of Action prepared by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board
                        was satisfactory to him.</p>
                    <p>The President recalled that in 1953 the U.S. had become involved in the
                        Mossedegh affair and the Iranian consortium. He thought the Attorney General
                        had been directed at that time to avoid prosecuting the oil companies. The
                        Attorney General said the President’s recollection was correct but that the
                        present case was different from the Iranian consortium case. At present the
                        Department of Justice was endeavoring to settle a law suit against certain
                        companies. He believed all the petroleum companies concerned would accept a
                        settlement along the lines agreed upon by the first company with which a
                        settlement was reached.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, while concurring in
                        general in the draft Action prepared by the Planning Board, suggested that
                        sub-paragraph d of that draft be amended by deleting the words “U.S. foreign
                        relations and” so that the Attorney General would be requested to conduct
                        proceedings in the oil cartel case with due regard to the effect on national
                        security interests. He also believed that the provision in subparagraph d
                        for consultation by the Attorney General with the Department of State should
                        be extended to include the Attorney General’s consultation with the
                        Department of Defense. The Attorney General agreed with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>’s proposed amendments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that the Attorney
                        General in his request for the advice of the Council had referred to joint
                        production refining, transportation and storage companies, with no mention
                        of joint marketing arrangements. The State comments on the oil cartel case
                        had similarly been addressed to joint production refining, transportation
                        and storage companies, not to marketing. Sub-paragraph e of the draft Record
                        of Action asserts that it is not inconsistent with sub-paragraph d to
                        proceed with the negotiation of consent judgments respecting joint
                        marketing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> felt
                        sub-paragraph e would be improved <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0667"
                        />if it began “Further agreed to recommend to the President that the
                        Attorney General be advised that it would not be inconsistent with d above”
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General said adoption of the draft Record of Action would enable
                        the Department to move ahead. The Department would, of course, consult with

                    <head>308. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>In the early morning hours of July 6, the last day before the Congress
                        recessed for the Democratic and Republican Presidential conventions, it
                        passed legislation amending the Sugar Act of 1948, as amended, and extending
                        the Act for 3 months beyond its expiration date of December 31, 1960. Had
                        Congress recessed without action on this legislation, Cuba could have sold
                        the remaining 25 percent of its annual 1960 quota at the U.S. domestic price
                        of about 2 cents per pound above the world market rate. The legislation as
                        passed specifically provided that the President should determine the new
                        quota for Cuba for the balance of 1960 and for the first 3 months of 1961,
                        and provided a formula for reallocation of the old Cuban quota. The
                        Eisenhower administration had requested from Congress broad discretion in
                        allocating the reductions in the Cuban quota, but because of the need to
                        demonstrate disapproval of the Castro government, the President signed the
                        legislation with its rigid formulas for reallocation.</p>
                    <p>Under the terms of the new legislation, the President was authorized to
                        import sugar to meet the needs of U.S. consumers in amounts not exceeding
                        the amount by which the Cuban quota was reduced. Under Congress’ formula,
                        the first reallocation was to be made to countries with quotas between 3,000
                        and 10,000 tons—Haiti, the Netherlands, China, Panama, and Costa Rica—to
                        bring their total imports to 10,000 tons each during the calendar year.
                        Next, the Act provided that 15 percent of the remainder of imports was to be
                        purchased from the Philippines. The balance of the allocations were to be
                        purchased from countries other than the six above which had quotas in the
                        U.S. market. These purchases were to be prorated according to their
                        established quotas. Countries in this category were Mexico, Peru, Nicaragua,
                        and the Dominican Republic. If additional sugar was required, the President
                        could under the terms of the new legislation authorize purchase from any
                        foreign producer without regard to allocation.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> announced on July
                        6 that he was reducing the Cuban sugar quota from 739,752 to 39,752 short
                        tons. In addition, Cuba was denied a quota of an additional 156,000 tons—its
                        share of the Puerto Rican and Hawaiian deficit, and any share occasioned by
                        increased U.S. domestic consumption, approximately 150,000 tons. In all, the
                        Cuban sugar quota was reduced by 1 million tons. (Department of State, <hi

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> introduced the subject to the

                        Briefing Note is filed in the Minutes of the Meeting and another copy is

                    <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s
                        presentation, the President said he had received the most glowing reports on
                        the prospects for petroleum production in Libya. He had been told that the
                        Libyan reserves exceeded even the Sahara reserves. He asked whether Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> had available an estimate of
                        possible oil production in Libya. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> remarked
                        that the latest estimates on Libyan oil production were not quite as
                        optimistic as the estimates which were current a year ago. The President
                        said reports he had received indicated that Libya had a great oil field and
                        would receive huge amounts of money from oil production.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said the Libyan oil field was
                        expected to produce 250,000 barrels per day in 1965 compared to a production
                        of 375,000 barrels per day in Mexico, 250,000 in Brazil, 450,000 in Tunisia,
                        and 3,350,000 in Venezuela. The President asked whether figures for Algeria
                        were available. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said Algeria
                        was expected to produce 560,000 barrels per day in 1965.</p>
                    <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0671"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> said he had recently
                        been in Libya and had talked with oil experts in that country. In his view,
                        the Libyan oil field had reserves in excess of present estimates. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> said he leaned toward Mr.
                            <persName>Dulles</persName>’ estimate rather than toward the estimate
                        just mentioned by the Secretary of Commerce. He had recently talked with oil
                        experts at our Embassy in Libya and had concluded that the Libyan oil field
                        had substantial but not tremendous reserves. He remarked that the oil
                        companies operating in Libya were being required to make a selection of the
                        acreage they would exploit and to release the remaining acreage for
                        redevelopment by other companies. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1"
                            >Mueller</persName> thought this last requirement was responsible for
                        pessimistic reports on Libyan oil reserves. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed, adding that the oil
                        companies were pushing ahead with production in Algeria but were holding
                        back in Libya.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then reported on the formation
                        last week of the new Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, with
                        Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Venezuela as members. The purpose of
                        the Organization was to control production and prices. What impact it will
                        have on the world oil picture remains to be seen. The President said that as
                        far as the Middle Eastern countries in the new Organization were concerned,
                        anyone could break up the Organization by offering five cents more per
                        barrel for the oil of one of the countries. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                        said that the five countries represented 80 per cent of the oil reserves in
                        the world and half of the oil in world trade. Egypt had not been invited to
                        be a member of this Organization because it was thought Egypt would not
                        collaborate with Iran due to Iranian-Egyptian tension over Israel. The
                        President said he thought Egypt had no oil in any case. Mr.
                            <persName>Dulles</persName> agreed that Egypt had very little oil;
                        however, the country was interested in oil questions because of the Syrian
                        pipelines. He said that Venezuela intended to seek Soviet cooperation with
                        the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, taking the line that Soviet price
                        cuts will hurt the underdeveloped countries. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought this Venezuelan initiative
                        would be helpful. It had been demonstrated in the past that the <gloss

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said the real
                        concern in recent years was not the amount of oil Europe imports from the
                        Middle East as compared with the amount it imports from the U.S. The
                        question was whether relations between the Middle East and Europe were of
                        such a nature that it would be reasonable to permit Europe to depend on
                        Middle Eastern oil. One element in the situation in recent years had been
                            <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0673"/>Middle Eastern antipathy toward
                        the U.K., a condition which was improving. At one time the Middle East was
                        in a strategic bargaining position vis-à-vis Europe but this position had
                        been lost because of the glut in the world oil market, as evidenced by
                        formation of the Organization just mentioned by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>. In Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName>’s view the North African oil reserves were
                        tremendous. The U.S. companies quite properly were not encouraging Libya to
                        assume that Libya’s enormous resources ought to be developed immediately
                        because such development would only add to the excess supply of oil in the
                        world market. The oil companies were not exercising any deception but were
                        simply not advising Libya to proceed with oil development. The oil reserves
                        in North Africa, however, are larger than the oil companies have given the
                        North African governments to understand. Moreover, the greatest natural gas
                        reservoir in the world lies under the Sahara. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> thought that a policy providing
                        for the supply of U.S. taxpayers’ dollars to other governments to enable
                        them to develop their oil resources made little sense. He said there was no
                        written policy precluding provision of U.S. assistance for petroleum
                        development abroad. However, the National Advisory Council had had this
                        matter under consideration for many years. If the practice of this
                        government in refusing to provide assistance for petroleum development
                        abroad is changed, Mexico will be the first applicant for assistance.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> noted that the
                        Mexican Government would not run the risk of financial assistance for oil
                        exploration. At present, the Mexican oil industry secures capital by selling
                        oil below the world market price and uses the capital, not for oil
                        exploration, but for governmental purposes. In the case of Bolivia, which
                        received U.S. assistance for petroleum development as an exception to the
                        general practice, four or five months had been required by this government
                        to devise a system under which we would make no direct loan to the Bolivian
                        oil agencies but would instead provide the loan to other agencies of the
                        Bolivian government.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> noted
                        that our lending policy involved a number of unwritten rules; for example,
                        money is not loaned by the Export-Import Bank for the operation of
                        newspapers because of the propaganda possibilities of newspapers. A change
                        in this policy had been considered and rejected. Similarly, money cannot be
                        loaned for the construction of TV facilities; until recently money could not
                        be loaned for the construction of hotels. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> thought that plenty of private
                        capital was available for petroleum development in any country which would
                        favorably receive such private capital. Accordingly, he did not believe U.S.
                        Government money should be used for petroleum development, especially when
                        such use would assist in building socialism. A somewhat different problem
                        was presented by pipelines and refineries. He thought it would be a mistake
                            <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0674"/>to encourage pipeline and
                        refinery development in areas which already had plenty of these facilities
                        but pipelines and refineries might be encouraged in areas or countries which
                        did not yet have them. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> believed that U.S. lending policy was very
                        important and that such policy should be debated and determined in the
                        National Advisory Council.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said he seemed to remember a
                        recent case in which the Soviets had been able to move into a country and
                        take over the transportation and distribution of oil. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                            >Gray</persName> was probably thinking of Ethiopia. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said there were those who thought that
                        government financial or other assistance for petroleum development, as
                        provided for in the draft action, constituted the only means of countering
                        Soviet activities which threaten to take over the oil facilities of a
                        country.</p>
                    <p>The President said we could talk about general policy of letting a country
                        help itself economically but in a cold war skirmish different
                        considerations, that is, national security considerations, might govern. Our
                        decisions might have to be determined in some cases by the political
                        situation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> felt
                        that any such decision should be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> expressed concern
                        that no action should be taken to strengthen the idea that there is a policy
                        against any assistance of any sort for petroleum development in the Free
                        World, no matter what the situation is in a particular case. He pointed out
                        that we did give assistance to Bolivia for petroleum development. In Bolivia
                        both a Bolivian nationalized oil company and various private U.S. oil
                        companies were operating. The Bolivian national company was about to go
                        bankrupt, in which case the Bolivian Government would have taken action
                        against the U.S. oil companies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> thought freedom of action should be maintained for
                        this government to act on a case-by-case basis, especially with respect to
                        pipelines and refineries, although not with respect to exploration, which he
                        characterized as a bottomless pit. In Ethiopia the U.S. lost out to the
                        Soviet Union in the competition for the right to construct a refinery
                        because of the unwritten policy of not providing financial assistance for
                        petroleum development. As a result the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        will now supply Ethiopia with oil. The Ethiopian case involved only $2-$3
                        million. We could not provide assistance to U.S. interests in Ethiopia in
                        time to forestall the Soviet activities because no agreement could be
                        reached in this government. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> thought this government should have freedom of action
                        in cases of this kind.</p>
                    <p>The President felt that problems of this nature should be settled on a
                        case-by-case basis. He believed the National Advisory Council should
                        re-examine the problem. Whenever the international political situation
                        demands that we provide financial assistance, then we <pb n="643"
                            xml:id="pg_643" facs="0675"/>should do so whether the commodity involved
                        is oil, diamonds, or what have you. Mr. <persName>Patterson</persName> said
                        the purpose of the draft action on this subject was to permit financial
                        assistance for petroleum development to be provided on a case-by-case basis.
                        He noted that nine countries were receiving some Soviet assistance.</p>
                    <p>The President said that assistance should not be provided for oil
                        exploration; if the countries involved would not finance their own
                        exploration, he saw no reason why we should do so.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> believed the
                        problems connected with financial assistance for petroleum development
                        should be decided in the National Advisory Council, which would take into
                        account political considerations. The President said that political
                        considerations may be overriding in any particular case. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> believed it would be a mistake to
                        write out all the rules associated with lending policy. Overriding political
                        considerations could be brought up by any agency in the National Advisory
                        Council and taken into account by that body.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Patterson</persName> inquired about taking into account
                        overriding national security interests. He said the National Security
                        Council had an interest in this problem. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> said he was inclined to agree with
                        the comments made by the Secretary of the Treasury, despite the fact that
                        the Commerce representative on the Planning Board had agreed to the draft
                        action. Mr. <persName>Patterson</persName> asked whether the Bolivian deal
                        had opened the door for financial assistance for petroleum development.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said the Bolivian
                        deal had opened the door a crack.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that the
                        Export-Import Bank refuses to finance a U.S. driller who wishes to drill for
                        oil in Argentina. The big oil companies are able to finance themselves but
                        this driller requires outside assistance. The President thought it might be
                        satisfactory to finance drilling equipment but not drilling operations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> wondered whether
                        those who had suggested settling this problem on a case-by-case basis meant
                        that every single case must come before the National Security Council. He
                        could not endorse such a procedure because he felt many of the cases were
                        not of sufficient importance to engage the time of the Council. He believed
                        the matter ought to be settled on the basis of a broad policy laid down by
                        the Council. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said
                        he was reluctant to see the National Security Council adopt rules for
                        financing. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> feared
                        that a policy of the kind reflected in the draft action might make it
                        possible for a loan to be made where circumstances might make a loan
                        undesirable. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed
                        out that financing could not be provided unless it was in the national
                        interest to do so. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        said that if he were a businessman, he would work hard to get his own
                        interest defined as part of the national interest. Secretary <pb n="644"
                            xml:id="pg_644" facs="0676"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> was inclined to agree with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>’s comments,
                        although his Planning Board representative had also agreed to the draft
                        action.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> should collaborate in preparing a policy on this
                        subject in general language so that individual cases could be decided by the
                        proper authority on the basis of the general policy. This general policy
                        should effect a reconciliation of the view that national security
                        considerations should be taken into account and the view of those who
                        emphasize financial considerations. The President added that each individual
                        case should be submitted to him for decision, even though the amounts of
                        money involved may be small.</p>

                            <item>Noted the statement of the Secretary of the Treasury that the
                                National Advisory Council on International Financial and Monetary
                                Problems, in its coordination of U.S. lending policy, considers the
                                financing of projects in the petroleum industry under the same basic
                                principles as it considers the financing of projects in other
                                industries and that in accord with its general lending policies the
                                U.S. Government has not provided significant financing for petroleum
                                development projects because: (1) the United States has not
                                generally financed any development enterprises abroad where private
                                capital is ready, willing and able to do the job; (2) the United
                                States would not participate in financing of projects in any
                                industry with a degree of risk such as is generally involved in
                                petroleum development except in the most unusual circumstances; and
                                (3) the cost of financing major petroleum development would absorb
                                an injustifiable proportion of the funds available for lending. In
                                considering petroleum projects, a difference should be noted between
                                exploration and development on the one hand, and refining and
                                transportation on the other. The problem involved in financing the
                                latter category is not as great as the former.</item>

                        <p rend="center">WESTERN EUROPEAN DEPENDENCE ON MIDDLE EAST OIL</p>
                        <p>In May of 1959 the Council discussed an interagency study on the
                            feasibility of using other sources of petroleum and additional transit
                            facilities (taking into account available information as to other
                            sources of energy) as a means of reducing the dependence of Western
                            Europe on Middle East petroleum and on existing transit facilities. At
                            that time <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 2080–b was
                            approved, which reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Agreed that, in order to retard Western Europe’s increasing
                                    dependence on Middle East oil and to reduce the effects on
                                    Western Europe of an emergency created by any complete or
                                    partial denial of Middle East oil resources, the United States
                                    should continue to encourage such action as is economically and
                                    politically feasible to facilitate the orderly development of
                                    alternative Free World sources of oil and other forms of energy
                                    outside the Middle East, and the broad diversification of means
                                    of transporting fuel in the Free World. The United States should
                                    also urge Western European countries to increase their petroleum
                                    stockpiles and to have in readiness emergency plans for
                                    conservation, sharing and transportation of oil.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This action was referred to the Director, <gloss target="#t_OCDM1"
                                >OCDM</gloss>, for appropriate implementation in the light of the
                            interagency study and in collaboration with the Departments of State,
                            Defense, Treasury, Interior and Commerce, progress reports on such
                            implementation to be submitted to the Council annually.</p>
                        <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0678"/>
                        <p>Today we have the first such annual progress report. The Planning Board
                            has discussed it and has prepared a draft Council action.</p>
                        <p>But before discussing the draft action, I would like to summarize for you
                            what the report says. It first analyzes the changes during the last
                            fifteen months in the outlook for Western Europe’s 1965 normal oil
                            situation. Estimated Western European demand for oil is up; estimated
                            supply from Libya and Algeria is up; estimated supply from the Soviet
                            Bloc is up; supply from the Western Hemisphere is down; and a tanker
                            surplus instead of a tanker balance is projected. These changes result
                            in approximately the same 1965 barrels-per-day Western European reliance
                            on Middle Eastern oil as was estimated in the 1959 study, but, because
                            of the greater demand, <hi rend="italic">relatively</hi> less reliance
                            under normal conditions. In Middle East emergencies, however, Western
                            Europe’s position would be worse in two out of three cases than
                            previously estimated,<note n="14" xml:id="d309fn14">Reference is to the
                                three hypothetical cases discussed in <ref target="#d295">Document
                                    295</ref>. The first was a Middle East transit stoppage in which
                                the Suez Canal and the piplelines to the Eastern Mediterranean were
                                closed down, the second was the transit stoppage in case one plus
                                denial of all Middle East oil sources, the third case envisioned the
                                transit stoppage and denial of all Middle East sources except
                                Iran.</note> primarily because of the substantial upward revision in
                            the estimated 1965 demand of Western Europe and the rest of the Eastern
                            Hemisphere. The foregoing is a statistical analysis which admittedly
                            does not take certain factors into account. The Planning Board concluded
                            that on balance this situation has improved in the last year and a
                            half.</p>
                        <p>The report also deals with U.S. Government actions which have affected
                            the picture. As a means of determining certain possible alternative new
                            or additional sources of oil outside the Middle East, the situation was
                            reviewed in eleven countries. Action was taken to provide U.S. financial
                            help to the Bolivian Government oil agency and to conduct a
                            U.S.-financed study of that organization. Investigations are being made
                            with chemical explosives to obtain data on which to base the design of a
                            possible nuclear experiment looking toward recovering oil from oil
                            shales. Finally, the U.S. has, in the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> supported emergency organization planning, encouraged
                            standby planning for rationing and conservation of supplies, and pointed
                            out that unconventional facilities, such as salt cavities and obsolete
                            tankers, may provide a relatively inexpensive form of emergency oil
                            storage.</p>
                        <p>Turning now to the draft Council action recommended unanimously by the
                            Planning Board, paragraphs b and c follow the recommendations of the
                            interagency report.</p>
                        <p>READ b and c.</p>
                        <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0679"/>
                        <p>Paragraph d would rescind the reporting requirement established by the
                            Note to Action 2080, with the understanding that any Council member may
                            request a progress report should circumstances change.</p>
                        <p>Is there any objection to this draft action? Because <gloss

                        <p rend="center">PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT IN FREE WORLD COUNTRIES</p>
                        <p>In the course of preparing the progress report on Western European
                            Dependence on Middle East Petroleum which we have just discussed, the
                            interagency committee formulated a split recommendation on U.S.
                            government aid for petroleum development. Inasmuch as the question was
                            broader than the Western European Dependence problem, the Planning Board
                            decided that recommendation on it should be developed as a separate
                            draft Council action.</p>
                        <p>The discussion in the interagency committee arose out of the belief on
                            the part of some agencies that there is an unwritten policy which
                            precludes provision of U.S. assistance for petroleum development abroad.
                            The question of whether there is or is not such a policy was the subject
                            of long and inconclusive debates in the Planning Board and the Board
                            Assistants. The real situation seems to be that while there is no
                            written policy on the matter which any one can point to, as a matter of
                            practice the U.S. Government has almost never provided assistance for
                            this purpose (Bolivia being the only exception), not on the grounds that
                            some written policy proscribes it, but on the basis of such practical
                            considerations as (a) the fact that such investment is very risky and a
                            questionable use, on purely economic grounds, of limited foreign
                            assistance funds; (b) the probable U.S. domestic political reaction to
                            such aid; and (c) the fact that private investment has generally done an
                            adequate job in this field.</p>
                        <p>The draft action before you is recommended by a majority of the Planning
                            Board, including representatives of Interior and Commerce, who believe
                            that the U.S. should, if required for national security in a particular
                            case, be prepared to provide governmental assistance for <pb n="648"
                                xml:id="pg_648" facs="0680"/>petroleum development. One kind of
                            situation which the majority has in mind is where U.S. government
                            assistance seems to be the only alternative to Soviet aid. Treasury and
                            Budget dissent, proposing deletion of the entire action.</p>

                    <p>The Jersey company representatives called at their own request to discuss
                        problems resulting from the formation of the Organization of Petroleum
                        Exporting Countries (<gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>).<note n="1"

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Welch</persName> stated that the Jersey company is greatly
                        concerned about the implications for the oil industry and the security
                        position of the West resulting from the formation of <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>. He fears that the companies will be
                        caught between producer country controls and the demands of consuming
                        countries. They will no longer be able to manage their business in a normal
                        way since the governments would take over the determination of oil prices,
                        the amounts of oil to be produced, and the destination of oil shipments.</p>
                    <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0681"/>
                    <p>The Jersey representatives believe a sharp distinction should be drawn
                        between prorationing in Texas and the international prorationing scheme
                        proposed by <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>. They also believe that
                        experience with other commodities is not pertinent in determining whether an
                        international oil agreement is feasible or desirable.</p>
                    <p>Although <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> has been set up in a
                        preliminary form, Jersey thinks it has basic weaknesses which will prevent
                        the development and administration of a restriction program. Iran and Iraq
                        would not be reliable members since they badly need increased output. The
                        Iranian minister in charge of oil matters has indicated that he did not know
                        that Rouhani, Iranian delegate to the Baghdad conference, had been
                        authorized to sign the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> agreement. This
                        may result in dissension within the Iranian Government on relations with
                            <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>. The Kuwaiti representative is
                        reported to have stated that Kuwait would be willing to reduce its crude
                        production in the general interest; but Jersey believes that the Ruler of
                        Kuwait, for prestige reasons, may not be able to do this if the other <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> members’ production increases. Moreover,
                        Kuwait is requesting bids on its potentially rich offshore area. Venezuela,
                        although very optimistic about <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, may
                        find itself in a weak competitive position and be unable to protect itself
                        vis-à-vis Arab countries or to influence Soviet oil export policies. Jersey
                        thinks the Soviets cannot be trusted to cooperate on oil although they are
                        cooperating on tin and diamonds. Mattei, head of the Italian Government oil
                        company, is currently buying oil from the Soviets at 90 cents per barrel
                        below posted price and Soviet price cutting would continue. Mr.
                            <persName>Rathbone</persName>, President of Jersey, is now in Libya
                        attempting to convince Libyan officials that they would have much to lose by
                        joining <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>. Libya will have low cost oil
                        favorably situated for the European market. By 1962 the Jersey company may
                        be producing 200,000 b/d in Libya and in four years as much as 500,000 b/d.
                        Oasis may also be able to reach this amount by 1964. With such prospects
                        Libya would have little advantage from joining a production cartel. Output
                        from the French Sahara will also be large. France is not expected to join
                            <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Jersey officials expect that there will be a large surplus crude oil
                        producing capacity for quite a number of years. They are uncertain, however,
                        how long crude oil without a “home” will remain a serious problem. The major
                        producers, who can increase their output to an almost unlimited degree, may
                        cut prices, if necessary, in order to protect their marketing position. How
                        long the present unsatisfactory situation will exist will depend largely on
                        Soviet Bloc price pressures and the sales efforts of newcomers. Cutting
                        below posted price is still prevalent. Mr. <persName>Welch</persName>
                        pointed to recent quotations to Ancap, the Uruguayan <pb n="650"
                            xml:id="pg_650" facs="0682"/>oil agency. Creole and Shell did not bid
                        since Venezuela objects to big discounts off posted price, but bids at 90
                        cents below postings were received from other companies.</p>
                    <p>Jersey thinks that progress can be made with the Arabs by talking oil
                        economics. They would argue the Arabs not to go too fast in <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> without knowing what the consequences may
                        be. The companies can show the Arabs that they have not been hurt by the
                        present concession system or by the recent price cuts; there has been no
                        reduction in national revenues from oil, and increases in world demand
                        should protect governments against future loss of revenues. <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> on the other hand might hold production
                        back, for example in Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait, without offering certainty of
                        higher prices to compensate for it. Moreover, the companies can point out
                        that if a bloc of powerful consuming countries is formed and new oil and
                        energy sources are tapped, the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                        countries would be hurt.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Welch</persName> stated that he thought the companies could
                        work out arrangements with individual countries to meet their most pressing
                        problems. He stated also that he hoped it would be possible to convince the
                        Arabs that if any future discounts below posted prices are required that
                        they should share the reduction in income with the companies. No further
                        reduction of postings is contemplated.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Welch</persName> stated that he hoped the U.S. Government would
                        use its influence in urging the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                        countries to go slowly in completing the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                            >OPEC</gloss> organization and implementing its program. He said that
                        the United States obviously cannot say that it opposes <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, but he did think that the U.S.
                        Government could express the hope that the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                            >OPEC</gloss> countries would consider fully the economic factors
                        involved in their program and would not reach hasty decisions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Welch</persName> said that he understood that the U.K.
                        Government was opposed to the formation of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                            >OPEC</gloss> and believed to be approaching Iran regarding it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> expressed appreciation on
                        behalf of the Department for Jersey’s views on the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                            >OPEC</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d310fn2">This paragraph originally
                            read: “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated
                            interest in the suggestion that the United States might discreetly
                            attempt to discourage certain countries, particularly Iran, from going
                            ahead with its membership in <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, but
                            did not indicate whether or not the U.S. Government would take any
                            action.” It was crossed through and the paragraph as printed was
                            substituted.</note></p>
                    <p>In closing, Mr. <persName>Welch</persName> stated that the Jersey company was
                        deeply concerned about the situation in Peru, where the Government, as a
                        result of communistic and nationalistic pressures, was not using its
                        strength in the Parliament to push through the bill which is designed to
                        settle the International Petroleum Company’s concession problem. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> suggested that the Jersey
                        representatives discuss this problem with Assistant Secretary <persName

                    <p>Mr. de Metz outlined the problems the producing companies have been having
                        with the Middle East governments who need increased crude oil output and
                        larger oil revenues. The companies have been doing all they can to increase
                        output, but the general oversupply situation, combined with disruptive
                        Soviet oil marketing policies, have made the problem of providing increased
                        revenues almost insuperable by present methods. Mr. de Metz suggested two
                        methods of approaching this problem. He thinks that European governments
                        might fix quotas on the amount of Soviet oil they would import. The other
                        device might be combined action by the large oil companies, including the
                        U.S. companies, against Soviet oil exports. To be effective such action
                        would necessitate a waiver of U.S. anti-trust laws so that the U.S.
                        companies could cooperate with the European companies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. de Metz also expressed opposition to the international prorationing
                        proposals of Tariki (Saudi Arabian Director General for Petroleum) and Perez
                        Alfonso (Venezuelan Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons).</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the Department
                        has been carefully studying Soviet oil export policies. He thought that the
                        West could in time expect to have to deal with similar export methods in
                        other commodities as the Soviet economy develops. So far as dealing with
                        Soviet oil exports in an effective manner is concerned Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought perhaps the only way would
                        be by coordinated action of the governments affected. He pointed out that
                        the types of joint action the oil companies <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652"
                            facs="0684"/>would have to take in order to deal with the problem
                        themselves would appear to involve marketing and price agreements which go
                        far beyond any action they were permitted by U.S. administrative exemptions
                        to take in the Iranian Consortium case and during the Suez emergency.
                        Combined action in this broad field would no doubt require special
                        congressional legislation. There is no possibility of such action for at
                        least several months, but it is not beyond the realm of possibility that
                        congressional action would be taken later if the matter were presented
                        carefully by the next Administration within the context of the cold war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated also that although
                        we do not favor an international prorationing scheme as proposed by the
                        Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (<gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                            >OPEC</gloss>), we have thought that there is a real likelihood that
                            <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> might be able to put through some
                        such scheme. On the other hand, the U.S. companies with whom we have talked
                        think that no such scheme can be worked out or administered.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Wilkinson</persName> spoke for Shell and said that he and Mr.
                            <persName>Loudon</persName> wished to mention their general concern with
                        the problem posed by the development of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                            >OPEC</gloss> in the Middle East. Since I was undoubtedly familiar with
                        the problem, Mr. <persName>Wilkinson</persName> said he would move
                        immediately to what might be done about it. In essence, his view was that it
                        would be useful for the U.S. Government to convey to the appropriate
                        governments concerned the thought that it would not be in their interest to
                        unilaterally force private companies to act against their will. He said it
                        could be pointed out that this would affect the <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653"
                            facs="0685"/>whole climate of private investment. He felt that such an
                        approach could be particularly effective in Venezuela and should also be
                        effective in Iran. He said the Shell Company had today delivered a letter to
                        Venezuela couched in very polite terms indicating that they were reserving
                        all their legal rights. Speaking for Shell, both Mr.
                            <persName>Wilkinson</persName> and Mr. <persName>Loudon</persName> said
                        they felt the oil companies must continue to be flexible and find ways to
                        meet legitimate fears of the Arab countries. They thought this could be done
                        if the Arab states did not push on too rapidly with unilateral action.</p>
                    <p>It was clear that Shell’s greatest concern in this matter at the moment is
                        with Venezuela. They pointed out that the Venezuelan action to force an
                        increase in prices could well lead to the construction of the trans-Canada
                        pipeline and the loss of the Canadian markets for Venezuelan oil.</p>
                    <p>I asked Mr. <persName>Wilkinson</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName>Loudon</persName> their opinion regarding the Soviet oil
                        offensive and observed that I understood that the Shell Company had been in
                        contact with the Soviets. Both Mr. <persName>Wilkinson</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName>Loudon</persName> seemed surprised at my observation but made
                        no attempt to deny or hide this fact. They said the Soviets had indirectly
                        approached them in London some six or nine months ago and there had been one
                        meeting between their people and the Soviet oil authorities at a relatively
                        high level. At this time the Soviets had suggested an arrangement whereby
                        Shell would market Soviet oil in Europe and would supply the Soviets in the
                        Far East. Mr. <persName>Wilkinson</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName>Loudon</persName> said they had made no reply to this Soviet
                        overture and intended to make none. They did not think this was appropriate
                        business for the Shell company and would not undertake it unless requested
                        by their government, and only then after full consultation with the American
                        oil companies. In short, they did not think anything could come of this.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the incursions of Soviet oil into Europe, while they felt the
                        recent increase had caused some problems they thought they could live with
                        it. However, they were concerned about a report they had recently received
                        regarding Mr. <persName>Mattei</persName>’s talks in Moscow. They understood
                        that at these talks, in addition to the arrangement for the importation of
                        12 million tons of Soviet oil over the next four years, there also had been
                        some informal discussion of the purchase by <gloss target="#t_ENI1"
                            >ENI</gloss> of an additional 40 million tons of Soviet oil over an
                        indefinite period to be paid for by Italian industrial production. Any such
                        amount would be far beyond Italian needs and would in effect mean that
                            <gloss target="#t_ENI1">ENI</gloss> would become the marketing agent for
                        Soviet oil throughout Europe. They did not think that this proposal would be
                        accepted but saw some danger in it because of its appeal to Italian export
                        interests in view of the large amount of Italian industrial exports that
                        would be involved in paying for this oil. They felt that the French would
                        certainly object <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0686"/>very strenuously
                        to any such arrangement and could stop it. They also said they understood
                        there was strong objection to this within the Italian Government even in
                        circles which had previously supported Mattei. Mr.
                            <persName>Wilkinson</persName> then handed me a brief memorandum on this
                        subject which is attached.<note n="1" xml:id="d312fn1">Attached but not
                            printed.</note></p>
                    <p>In closing, I asked Mr. <persName>Wilkinson</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName>Loudon</persName> when they thought the oil supply and demand
                        picture might be righted. In their estimation this should take place
                        sometime between 1965 and 1970, which is similar to the view currently
                        expressed by the large American oil companies. In this connection, they
                        informed me they had recently found substantial quantities of oil in
                        Nigeria. Nine out of their last ten wildcats in this region had been
                        producers. While the Nigerian oil discovery was not in anything like Middle
                        Eastern quantities they felt that they had upwards of 1 billion barrels of
                        oil, which after usual development efforts should produce 300 or 400
                        thousand barrels a day.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Gordon</hi>: For some time now I have been noting
                        with concern the increase in Soviet commerce with the free and uncommitted
                        nations of the world. Recent actions of Soviets to sell crude oil to India
                        at 25% below the posted Persian Gulf price and to barter 100,000 barrels of
                        crude oil per day to Italy in exchange for steel pipe and rubber are
                        examples of the many economic moves which are being used by the Soviets in
                        the Cold War which we are now waging. Unless the United States and the other
                        western powers can thwart such moves, the semblance of Soviet ability under
                        communism to produce and sell more cheaply than we can under the
                        capitalistic system may have very serious consequences in our struggle to
                        convince the peoples of the world that democratic principles and free
                        enterprise are better and more efficient than dictatorship and
                        communism.</p>
                    <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0687"/>
                    <p>I have therefore had the enclosed brief study prepared to show the extent to
                        which the Soviets have progressed in their efforts to disrupt and capture an
                        increasing share of the international petroleum market. It appears that the
                        progress made by the Soviets in this field is sufficient to justify my
                        initial concern. I suggest that we are faced with a problem of sufficient
                        magnitude to warrant a thorough study by the interested agencies of our
                        government working in conjunction with leaders in the petroleum industry to
                        see if we cannot find a means of combatting this form of economic
                        warfare.</p>
                    <p>I am addressing similar letters and sending copies of the study to the
                        Secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce and Treasury; the Joint Chiefs;
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> and Jack Irwin.</p>

                        <p rend="center">GROWING CRISIS IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING OF
                            PETROLEUM BY WESTERN NATIONS</p>
                        <p>The past year has seen the first clear cut signs of a deterioration of
                            Western control of world oil supplies. As a result of the Cold War,
                            growing nationalism, the discovery of new oil fields and mounting Soviet
                            competition—competition which cost considerations and Arab politics make
                            very difficult to meet—Western oil companies are faced with increasing
                            problems in maintaining the flow of their products around the world.</p>
                        <p>During the last two years the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                            more than doubled its oil exports, increasing them from 207,000 barrels
                            per day in 1958 to about 450,000 barrels per day in 1960. Current trends
                            in Soviet production and consumption indicate that this figure will
                            again be doubled by 1965 when exports to non-Communist countries may
                            reach 1 million barrels per day—if markets can be found. On this basis
                            it is probable that Soviet Bloc oil will comprise about 5% of the oil
                            moving in international commerce. This will be done on the solid
                            foundation of an approximate doubling of Soviet production between 1960
                            and 1965, rising from its present level of about 2.7 million barrels per
                            day to between 5 and 5.5 million barrels per day in 1965. As significant
                            as these figures are, however, they cloud the most dangerous aspect of
                            the picture—the concentration of these exports in a few countries.</p>
                        <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0688"/>
                        <p>Iceland, one of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies, imports
                            all of its <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> requirements from the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Finland imports two-thirds of
                            its requirements from the Soviet Union; West Germany, 13 percent; Italy,
                            20 percent. Japan is moving toward increasing its reliance on Bloc oil
                            and trend in this direction may be developing in Brazil. India has
                            recently signed agreements which will make it a large consumer of Bloc
                            petroleum products. Last but not least is Cuba’s complete dependence on
                            Soviet sources of supply.</p>
                        <p>Virtually all of these inroads have been made by the use of inducements
                            and agreements which Western oil companies cannot match. Barter is the
                            most important of these. Soviet state trading monopolies and government
                            planning make it possible for Moscow to agree to accept fish from
                            Iceland in exchange for oil, thus guaranteeing that country a market for
                            its fish and a stable price for the purchase of its oil requirements. No
                            hard currency is required and many of the uncertainties of world markets
                            and prices are eliminated. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and
                            Cuba have made the same type of arrangements with cotton and sugar
                            respectively as their means of payment. Italy, West Germany, and France
                            obtain markets for some of their machinery and steel exports. A new
                            element has been added in India where the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> has agreed to accept non-convertible Indian currency
                            in payment. All of these agreements are calculated on a price basis
                            lower than that offered by Western companies. The recent $200 million
                            Italian contract with Moscow provides for the exchange of 240,000 tons
                            of 40 inch steel pipe and 50,000 tons of synthetic rubber for
                            approximately 84 million barrels of Soviet crude oil—indicating a price
                            of about $1.00 per barrel which is below the actual cost of production
                            of Middle East operators. Cost considerations are clearly a secondary
                            factor to political motivations when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> is trying to penetrate Western oil markets.</p>
                        <p>The problem, from the point of view of US national security interests, is
                            not simply that the Western companies lose markets or that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> balance of payments suffers. The impact
                            of Soviet activity in the next five years will still not be severe
                            enough to provide an insurmountable threat to the operations of these
                            companies, particularly in the areas of producing and refining. However,
                            Soviet activity will present at least two grave problems. One stems from
                            the leverage which the Soviets can exert to influence the price of oil
                            in international markets by their “dumping” or price-cutting operations.
                            Their offerings of up to 450,000 barrels per day of oil at ridiculously
                            low prices can seriously depress the world price of 20,000,000 barrels
                            per day of free world oil. A second problem is created by the picture of
                            the leading Communist state bettering Western private enterprise in
                            competitive markets. Nations which find their energy supplies closely
                            tied to Soviet oilfields are almost certain to turn a more attentive ear
                                <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0689"/>toward Communist overtures
                            lest their vital oil supply line be tampered with by the Kremlin. At the
                            same time, the “unfair” practices used by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> to gain its foothold in Western markets will be
                            quickly forgotten while the fact that Western private enterprise has
                            suffered a setback at the hands of Soviet communism will stand in the
                            eyes of much of the world as an example of the Soviet system winning out
                            over the American system. Halting the development of such situations is
                            clearly a matter of great importance to <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> national security.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the “unfair” competition which Western oil interests face
                            from Moscow, there is growing momentum among various Arab leaders to
                            implement plans which will give them a more active role in the marketing
                            operations of the oil companies. With the aim of guaranteeing their
                            countries a stable level of high income, proposals of nationalist
                            leaders of Arab countries would, in effect, reduce the competitiveness
                            of Western oil even further compared with Soviet products and take away
                            much of the initiative in marketing now exercised by the companies by
                            putting it into the hands of the government of the producing country. We
                            are, therefore, likely to see a situation developing which will act as a
                            restraint on the normal private-competitive structure of American and
                            European petroleum enterprises at precisely the time when these concerns
                            are about to face their greatest challenge from the Communist
                            system.</p>
                        <p>The problem, although not unique in the oil industry is, however, here
                            most acute. We may expect to see similar challenges made to the security
                            of the Western alliances and the free world in other economic fields.
                            Our experience gained in meeting the broad economic threat of
                            Sino-Soviet aid to underdeveloped countries in the form of investment
                            credits, may be helpful. The danger has been clearly seen here. In this
                            case, it was apparent that private business could not operate on its own
                            against the odds of the entire Soviet political and economic system. The
                            attack on this Soviet offensive has already been shaped and,
                            essentially, involves direct government assistance in overseas
                            development projects combined with government encouragement of
                            increasing private economic activity. At present, efforts are underway
                            to make this a more concerted offensive by all the developed countries
                            of the West. Greater concern and more positive action by the United
                            States will be required to meet the growing threat in the petroleum
                            field.</p>

                    <p>At a conference attended by six major oil producing nations held in Baghdad,
                        September 10–14, 1960, a permanent body called the Organization of Petroleum
                        Exporting Countries (<gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>) was established.
                        Five of the nations represented—Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and
                        Venezuela—became charter members and Qatar has been given observer
                        status.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the conference, it was announced that the purpose of the
                            <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> would be to provide a forum for
                        the unification of oil policies of member countries and to determine ways to
                        safeguard the interests of the members, both individually and collectively.
                        It was further agreed that: (1) the members could no longer remain
                        indifferent to the attitude of oil companies in modifying prices; (2) the
                        members would demand that oil companies keep prices stable and that they
                        restore present prices to those prevailing prior to the August, 1960,
                        reduction; (3) the members would study and formulate a system to insure
                        price stability by, among other means, the regulation of production giving
                        proper consideration to the interests of producer and consumer countries;
                        and (4) in the event the application of any unanimous decision by member
                        countries should result in sanctions by an oil company against one member
                        country, no other member would take advantage of the situation by accepting
                        any offer from an oil company whether in the form of increased exports or an
                        improvement in prices.</p>
                    <p>A sub-committee of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> is to meet in
                        November in Baghdad to organize an agenda for the second meeting which is to
                        be held in Caracas in January, 1961. In the meantime, a permanent
                        Secretariat is being established but its location has not yet been
                        determined.</p>
                    <p>The creation of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> was triggered by the
                        major oil companies reducing Middle East posted prices for crude oil in
                        August, 1960. A prior Soviet offer of cheap oil to India forced the three
                        Western firms operating there to reduce their prices 12¼% below the Persian
                        Gulf price. This in turn made price cuts for Middle East crude inevitable
                            <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0691"/>because of the interlocking
                        system of oil company ownership and their pressure from other consumer
                        countries for lower prices. Furthermore, a considerable amount of crude was
                        being sold at discounts because of the intense competition for markets.
                        Meanwhile, Abdulla Tariki, Director of Saudi Petroleum and Mineral Affairs
                        and Juan Perez Alfonso, Venezuelan Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons, had
                        been advocating a system to pro-ration oil output through the establishment
                        of an organization with the power to determine each member’s share in the
                        world market and, thus, maintain favorable oil prices. Following the price
                        cut, the Middle East countries and Venezuela called an emergency meeting in
                        Baghdad to create an organization to study pro-rationing, which they felt
                        might help protect their interests.</p>
                    <p>Membership in the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> is restricted to
                        countries with net substantial exports of oil unless the country is accepted
                        unanimously by the five charter members. By restricting membership in this
                        way, it keeps out the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Bahrain and,
                        thus, makes it possible for both Iraq and Iran to participate. Although the
                        United States is a major oil producer, it cannot qualify for membership
                        since it is a net importer of oil. This leaves membership open to such
                        countries as the Soviet Union, Libya, Indonesia, Canada, and perhaps
                        Argentina and Colombia, which are net exporters.</p>

                                recognize the new posted prices for crude as the basis for royalty
                                or income tax purposes.</item>

                            <item>Russian participation in <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> is
                                a possibility, but it does not seem likely at the present time.
                                During the Second Arab League Petroleum Congress held in Beirut
                                October 17–22, 1960, Perez Alfonso (attending as an observer) stated
                                that <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> countries should study
                                the possibility of Russian participation. If necessary, he was
                                prepared to go to Moscow although his country had no diplomatic
                                relations with the Soviet Union. The Russian observers also
                                attending the conference did not take the hint. On the contrary,
                                their condescending attitude and their statement to the Congress
                                that the Soviet Union was determined to reestablish its historic
                                share in the West European oil market appears, at least to some
                                extent, to have frightened and angered the Arab countries attending
                                the Congress.</item>

                            <item>While the motivation behind the creation of <gloss
                                    target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> is to establish some form of
                                joint pro-rationing among the member countries, this goal seems
                                almost impossible to realize. On the one hand, <gloss
                                    target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> suffers from the major weakness
                                that neither Libya nor Algeria are represented. These countries are
                                not likely to become members since they are preoccupied in becoming
                                major oil producers. On the other hand, there are many obstacles in
                                the way of parceling out each country’s share of the world’s oil
                                market unless all producer and consumer countries are members of the
                                same organization. During the Arab League Petroleum Congress in
                                Beirut, M. J. Sladic of the Saudi Directorate for Petroleum Affairs,
                                presented a paper on pro-rationing. The paper appears to have made
                                the delegates aware of the problems involved in administering such a
                                system and they failed to consider any resolution favoring
                                pro-rationing. Several criteria can be used to determine each
                                country’s share (proven oil reserves, historical markets, present
                                production, population, etc.) but each one favors one or two
                                producers to the disadvantage of the others. There is no indication
                                that Middle East oil producers are willing at the present time to
                                forego production increases if it points to a loss in revenue. In
                                this connection, it is worth noting that Iraq, one of the founders
                                of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, is even now seeking to
                                obtain IPC relinquishment of vast areas in Iraq—to award new
                                concessions and thus step up Iraqi production well above present
                                levels.</item>

                    <p>The policy of the United States is to encourage the free movement of
                        petroleum by private enterprise in world trade. Although pro-rationing
                        originated in the United States in 1931 in east Texas and continues to exist
                        in seven major oil producing states in the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                        >US</gloss>, it bears no relationship to pro-rationing by Middle East
                        countries. The former is primarily a conservation measure. However, by
                        having pro-rationing at home and by participating in international commodity
                        agreements (coffee, wheat), where production controls are exercised, it is
                        difficult for the United States to take a public position against
                        pro-rationing of oil by oil exporting countries.</p>
                    <p>Before the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> adopts a policy with regard to
                        the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>, it will have to wait to determine
                        what sort of an organization it is dealing with. Although the member
                        countries have agreed to study pro-rationing as a measure to insure price
                        stability, there is no indication at this time that they will be successful.
                        So far, <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> countries seem to be unanimous
                        in only one respect—their unwillingness to allow the oil companies to make
                        any further reductions in the price of crude oil without prior approval of
                        the member countries.</p>

                                our present policy that international commodity arrangements should

                                as evidence that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is working
                                hand in glove with oil monopolies. It would probably strengthen

                                the danger that the Soviet Union could exploit this

                    </list>
                    <p>Lord Home raised the subject of oil, the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                            >OPEC</gloss>, and Venezuela. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said that several U.S. oil companies had got the same
                        idea at the same time, and it was apparent that thinking among the oil
                        companies was much the same, except for the French oil companies. He said
                        that in his opinion the situation is bad from the viewpoint of over-all
                        security. He pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> put
                        control of prices in the hands of Middle East companies and Venezuela. He
                        said that the basic concept of controlling prices had been accepted in
                        agreements relating to coffee and tin, but that he did not like [<hi
                            rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                        exercising the control in the case of oil. He expressed the view that the
                        trouble stems from the Soviets, and asked whether the British side had any
                        ideas about what could be done substantively to slow things up. Lord Home,
                        in response, inquired whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> felt that the Soviets are likely to upset the
                        situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that he
                        thought they could cause trouble, but nothing insuperable. Lord Home asked
                        whether there was any influence that could be brought to bear on Venezuela.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that he did not
                        know what could be done since power rested with one man. He expressed the
                        opinion that the oil companies had done as much as they can to influence the
                        Venezuelan situation.</p>

                            of November 19 on Soviet Oil Sales<note n="1" xml:id="d316fn1"><ref

                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> is concerned about
                        increasing Soviet oil sales to the Free World, especially to certain
                        countries such as India, Italy, Iceland, Finland and Cuba. He believes that
                        various untoward results will ensue: (1) price cutting in the international
                        oil market; (2) the appearance of Soviet economic superiority over the
                        private enterprise <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0695"/>system in this
                        critical field; (3) undue dependence on the Soviet Union by selected Free
                        World countries. He suggests “a thorough study by the interested agencies of
                        our Government working in connection with leaders in the petroleum industry
                        to see if we cannot find a means of combatting this form of economic
                        warfare”. He sent his letter also to the Secretaries of State, Defense,
                        Commerce and Treasury; the Joint Chiefs; <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                            Dulles</persName> and Jack Irwin.</p>
                    <p>To my knowledge, the facts cited by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1"
                            >Burke</persName> in his letter and enclosed study seem to be correct.
                        With respect to India, a United Press International story from New Delhi on
                        November 23 said that Indian government officials believe that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will be India’s major supplier of
                        petroleum products by 1966.</p>
                    <p>I believe, however, that the possible consequences of Soviet oil sales are
                        exaggerated. This is not to deny that Soviet oil sales will have some
                        disruptive influence on the international oil market or that some Free World
                        countries may become more dependent on their trade with the Soviet Bloc. But
                        taking Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName>’s three feared
                        results in turn: the effects of price cutting will be limited by the
                        relatively small quantities of oil which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> can offer and the Soviet desire to get a good price; most
                        nations have enough knowledge of the Soviet economic system not to
                        automatically equate better prices and terms with superior efficiency; and
                        the dependence of most of the Free World countries involved is not on the
                        supply of oil (which is abundantly available from the Free World) but on the
                        markets for the Free World products (fish, cotton, sugar, etc.).</p>
                    <p>Turning to the policy problem, it is difficult to see what we can do within
                        the existing general policy framework. Par. 31–d of Basic Policy (<gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5906/1)<note n="2" xml:id="d316fn2"><gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5906/1 is scheduled for publication in
                            volume III.</note> says that the U.S. should act to prevent the Bloc
                        “from subverting or gaining political control of independent nations or
                        undermining Free World economic institutions”. But Par. 45 (d and e)
                        recognizes that Free World countries will engage in trade with the Bloc and
                        rules out attempting to counter each and every move in the Bloc economic
                        offensive. Par. 45–e does provide for taking steps in particular
                        circumstances to discourage <hi rend="italic">less developed nations</hi>
                        from accepting Bloc aid in sensitive fields or becoming unduly dependent on
                        Bloc trade. Maybe attempts to thwart some of these oil deals would fall
                        within this policy, but I believe that these statements were directed
                        primarily at Bloc aid which results in swarms of Bloc technicians (e.g., the
                        Czech telephone bid in Uruguay and the Aswan dam proposition in Egypt) and
                        at over-all trade dependence, such as the cases of Finland, Iceland and
                        Cuba. These latter three situations have been the subject of intensive
                        government attention in the past, and continue to be so. In the cases of
                        Finland and Iceland, the problem centers around <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664"
                            facs="0696"/>the dearth of Free World markets for the exports being sent
                        to the Bloc. In the case of Cuba, the political hostility of the Castro
                        regime toward the U.S. and the consequent need for sugar markets are
                        governing. I believe that the realities of the situation suggest that the
                        U.S., in order to do something about Soviet oil sales to the Free World,
                        would probably have to furnish oil to India for nonconvertible rupees, to
                        Iceland for fish, to Finland for wood products, etc. I cannot conceive of
                        our being willing to do this.</p>
                    <p>One should bear in mind that the U.S. Government doesn’t possess surpluses of
                        oil, that the oil business is conducted in our economy by private business.
                        In other words, oil is not in the same situation as are wheat, cotton, rice,
                        and many other agricultural commodities, where the Government owns vast
                        surpluses which are made available to various foreign nations under several
                        programs. Even those commodities are not disposed of in barter, except for a
                        limited number of metals and minerals.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing analysis takes into account the intelligence material on the
                        Soviet challenge given in paragraphs C, 11–18, and 34 of the attached draft
                        intelligence estimate, <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 30–60, “Middle

                            corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> because the State Department is
                        about finished with a thorough study of the problem. I do not know what is
                        in the study at this stage. It was initiated by Messrs. <persName

                        When it is finished, in a week or ten days, State will be able to decide
                        whether it wants to put a paper into the Planning Board on the subject. Bob
                        Packard has promised to keep me informed on the progress of the study and
                        State’s conclusions. In the interim, I believe that a reply to Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> along the lines of the

                        <item>A major factor in the world oil picture for the next several years
                            will be the continuing surplus of producing capacity. This condition
                            reflects the development of new sources in North Africa and expansion of
                            Soviet export capabilities, as well as increasing capacity in the Middle
                            East. As a result, Western Europe will draw a somewhat smaller
                            percentage of its petroleum requirements from the Middle East.
                            Individual sources of oil may be shut down and transit facilities may be
                            blocked temporarily, but we believe that a lasting area-wide breakdown
                            is unlikely during the period of this estimate. Western <pb n="666"
                                xml:id="pg_666" facs="0698"/>Europe, in particular, will remain
                            heavily dependent on Middle Eastern oil, and the oil producing Middle
                            Eastern countries will almost certainly continue to receive oil revenues
                            sufficient to support substantial programs of general economic
                            development. (Paras. 10, 34–35, 40)</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The terms and conditions of Middle East oil concessions are likely to
                            be considerably changed. The position of the Western oil companies will
                            be further weakened by erosion of the 50/50 profit sharing formula and
                            by the joint efforts of the producing countries to control prices.
                            Greater participation by local governments in the management of the oil
                            companies is likely. We do not believe, however, that large-scale
                            nationalization of industry facilities is probable or that the companies
                            will feel compelled to liquidate their interests in the area during the
                            period of this estimate. (Paras. 24–30, 36–38)</item>

                        <item>By 1965 Soviet oil exports will probably account for as much as seven
                            percent of the oil moving in international trade outside the Bloc. This
                            will enable the Soviet Union to upset markets in various individual
                            countries and even to displace Western companies in some smaller
                            markets. Soviet oil is likely also to spur further price cuts in the
                            world market, and will be used in an effort to promote Soviet influence,
                            particularly in underdeveloped areas; such tactics, however, will
                            probably be limited to some degree by the Soviet’s desire to enjoy the
                            economic benefits their exports bring, especially from Western Europe.
                            Growing Soviet exports, together with an expanded program of economic
                            and technical assistance for the development of new oil facilities in
                            Asia and Africa, will make the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a
                            force to be reckoned with in the international petroleum field. We do
                            not believe, however, that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            will be able to upset the preponderant position of the Western companies
                            or destroy the present overall pattern of the Middle East oil industry.
                            Even a Communist takeover in one of the producing countries would not
                            necessarily result in a refusal to sell the country’s oil to the West.

                        <item>On balance, we think the odds are against developments in regard to
                            Middle East oil that would be critically detrimental to <gloss

                            be faced with a number of broad problems. Among these will be
                            determination of the balance of interest between the desirability of
                            developing alternate sources of oil to meet Western Europe’s needs and
                            the importance of assuring Middle Eastern countries of sufficient oil
                            revenue to avoid instability; resolution of possible conflicts of
                            interest between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and its Western
                            allies, especially the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France;
                            policy differences between Western governments and those of the oil
                            producing countries; and the difficulty of determining in particular
                            circumstances whether and how US strategic and commercial interests
                            coincide or conflict. (Paras. 39–45)</item>

                                Hemisphere consumes most of its own production. All but a small part
                                of Middle East oil is exported. In 1959, Middle East oil constituted
                                51 percent of all Free World oil moving in international trade.
                                Sixty-one percent of Middle East exports went to Western Europe to
                                supply 73 percent of that area’s total needs. Most of the rest went
                                to Asia and the Far East where it filled 67 percent of that area’s
                                requirements. The 540,000 barrels a day (b/d) which flowed to the

                            <item>The Middle East’s key role in world oil stems partly from the
                                richness of its petroleum resources, partly from the
                                long-established pattern of efficient exploitation of these
                                resources, and partly from its central geographical location. Middle
                                East reserves are tremendous, almost 70 percent of the Free World’s
                                proved total. Productivity is high and hence costs are low. In 1959,
                                oil production in the Middle East averaged 4,700 b/d per well,
                                compared with 295 b/d in Venezuela, and 12 b/d in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Heavy investment in pipelines and
                                tankers has produced a surplus of low cost carrying capacity.
                                Concession areas have generally been large; the terms of the
                                concession have been similar; and most of the concessions have been
                                in the hands of companies owned by several large American, British,

                                one indigenous source which can pay for the development programs,
                                buy the arms, and acquire the myriad technical wonders and luxuries

                                century. Oil revenues comprise 95 percent of total government
                                receipts in Kuwait, 80 percent in Saudi Arabia, 66 percent in Iraq,
                                and about 50 percent in Iran. Middle Eastern states derive
                                additional revenues from customs receipts on goods imported with oil
                                originated funds and additional foreign exchange from local
                                expenditures by the oil companies. Of the countries whose oil

                                and probably political chaos; the country has built up no money

                                for the government to remain effective for more than a few months.
                                Kuwait, possessor of the world’s largest proved oil reserves, equal
                                to those of the entire Western Hemisphere, is totally a creation of
                                the oil boom. The Ruler has invested large sums in the <gloss

                                considerable time on these investments if present revenues ceased.
                                However, these investments would probably be blocked by the British
                                Government in the event of an ouster of the Kuwait Oil Company. Even
                                if the funds remained unblocked, the development program would
                                gradually grind to a halt and business would begin to stagnate. Iran
                                and Iraq possess other sources of revenue, but would face serious
                                economic dislocation as well as drastic reductions in their
                                development programs and general governmental activity if oil
                                revenues were shut off. In all these countries, substantial and
                                prolonged deprivation of oil revenue, particularly if no resumption
                                were in sight, would, we believe, generate sufficient dislocation
                                and unrest to make the fall of their governments likely. In a

                        <item>World consumption of oil has increased greatly since World War II. In
                            Western Europe, requirements grew by about 13 percent annually between
                            1946 and 1959; for the Free World as a whole the rise was over 7 percent
                            annually. However, Free World producing capacity has expanded even more
                            rapidly, especially in recent years. As a result, there is now a
                            substantial excess of producing capacity over consumption. This
                            situation is expected to continue into the mid-1960’s <pb n="669"
                                xml:id="pg_669" facs="0701"/>and possibly beyond. During this
                            period, Western European requirements will level off (to perhaps an
                            increase of 7 percent annually); total Free World demand will rise
                            somewhat less rapidly than in recent years; and producing capacity will
                            continue to grow with the development of new sources of petroleum in the
                            Middle East and elsewhere.<note n="5" xml:id="d317fn5">During this
                                period, as technological developments provide for new transportation
                                facilities, the consuming areas may begin to receive supplies of
                                natural gas from overseas sources. Eventually world energy supplies
                                will be supplemented by a variety of new sources: shale oil and tar
                                sands, wind, solar, cellular, and nuclear power. [Footnote in the

                            are expected to put 1,000,000 b/d on the market by 1965. Soviet exports
                            to the Free World will add to available supplies. Transportation, not
                            long ago a limiting factor in the movement of oil, is more than adequate
                            to meet anticipated demands for the 1960’s. Free World tanker surplus is
                            substantial and Middle Eastern pipelines are even now not working at

                        <item>In recent years a number of new companies have entered the industry in
                            North Africa and the Middle East. New sources of supply have been

                            who can be persuaded to give the consuming country markedly better terms

                        <item>The oil industry will be increasingly affected by the import policies
                            of the consumer countries. Japan is already taking measures to ensure
                            domestic markets for oil produced abroad by its nationals. Italy will
                            probably eventually do likewise. France has already persuaded
                            foreign-owned refining and marketing organizations within its borders to
                            accept French-owned Algerian crude. As more and more Algerian crude
                            becomes available, Paris may revive its now quiescent efforts to get
                            Common Market preference for it. West Germany may also seek to ensure a
                            place in its domestic market for any crude that may be brought in by the
                            West German companies which are now participating in exploration abroad.

                            the extent to which oil must be paid for in dollars or other foreign
                            currencies is now a less important factor than formerly. Nonetheless,
                            most governments are still eager to husband their foreign exchange.
                            Moreover, they will take advantage of offers by new producers selling
                            crude at a sharp discount and be tempted by deals involving soft
                            currency, barter exchanges, or government to government

                        <item>There is little likelihood that the expanding market east of Suez will
                            provide an outlet for much of the Middle East’s surplus producing
                            capacity. Consumption in Asia and the Far East is expected to increase
                            at about seven percent a year during the next five years, but in
                            absolute terms this means only an average of about 130,000 b/d annually.
                            There is a chance that these increased requirements will be partially
                            covered by such developments as expanded production in Indonesia or new
                            discoveries in India. Moreover Soviet oil can be expected to be sold in
                            increasing quantities in this area, as already evidenced by shipments to
                            Japan and India.</item>

                                4.8 million b/d, almost double 1959 production. This quantity would

                                would depend also on its ability to develop refinery capacity,
                                internal transport, and tanker lift, as well as to open new markets
                                for such oil. There is evidence that the Soviet Union has embarked
                                on a program to do so. Its export drive will continue to be
                                motivated by political as well as economic considerations.</item>

                            <item>We estimate that in 1965 Soviet oil exports will probably account
                                for as much as seven percent of the total international movement
                                into Free World markets. We do not believe that this of itself will
                                upset the preponderant position of the Western companies in
                                international trade or destroy the present overall pattern of the
                                Middle East oil industry. It will, however, enable the Soviet Union
                                to compete actively in the Free World market to the detriment of
                                Middle East oil and to upset markets in various individual consuming
                                countries. In small markets, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> could even displace Western oil companies. In a
                                situation of continuing worldwide surplus, a growing influx of
                                Soviet oil is likely also to spur further price cuts, with a
                                consequent disrupting influence on relations between the Middle
                                Eastern governments and the Western companies. Moreover, an expanded
                                program of technical assistance for the development of new producing
                                and refining facilities will probably increase Soviet leverage in
                                various underdeveloped countries. All this will make the <gloss

                            <item>The prospects for a continuing world oil surplus have introduced
                                new problems into the relationship between the companies and the
                                oil-producing countries. The governments of the latter are most
                                immediately concerned with problems of revenue—revenue to add to the
                                power and prestige of the ruling groups, to support economic
                                development programs, and even to pay for regular government
                                expenditures. In the past the various producing countries have taken
                                advantage of each others’ difficulties to increase their own oil
                                profits. The Arab states were happy to see their oil fill the gap
                                created by Mossadegh’s shutdown of Iranian oil. Iran in turn
                                profited when the <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0705"/>flow of
                                Arab oil was disrupted by the 1956–1957 Suez difficulties. Recently,
                                however, all the producing states have seen further increases in
                                their revenues threatened by two reductions in the posted price of
                                crude oil.<note n="8" xml:id="d317fn8">In the Middle East, a

                            <item>For some years there have been other deep and troublesome
                                stirrings in the producing countries. These are based partly on the
                                concept that the oil beneath their territories is a national
                                patrimony which will not last forever and which is being exploited
                                by the Western oil companies under unjust arrangements made when the
                                area and its rulers were under the political domination of the West.
                                From this concept the idea is derived that the national sovereignty
                                and national interests of the contracting states should override the
                                legal rights and commercial interests of the private companies.
                                These feelings are shared even by many members of conservative
                                groups, and they are deeply and widely held among most other
                                politically conscious elements in the area. Out of them have grown a
                                number of demands aimed at increasing local control of oil

                                local profits. In addition, local resentment is increased by the
                                rising conviction that ruling groups, such as that in Saudi Arabia,
                                are squandering oil revenues without due regard for the welfare of
                                the people as a whole.</item>

                                companies. Governments of some producing countries are showing
                                increasing interest in participation in ownership and management of
                                the producing companies. Apart from the additional profits they
                                would receive as stockholders, this would give them a greater voice
                                in such questions as how much oil should be produced and to whom it
                                should be sold. It would also bring them in closer touch with the
                                industry as a whole and would, they hope, enable them to influence
                                international activities now beyond their control. National

                            <item>The most ambitious of local aspirations, put forward chiefly by
                                Saudi Director of Petroleum Abdullah Tariki, demands that all

                                by integrated companies, in the management and profits of which the
                                host governments would have a share. This goes considerably beyond
                                the other schemes, since it would give the producing governments a
                                share in control over company facilities and operations beyond their
                                own borders. The threat of nationalization, which the area
                                governments have always seen as their weapon of last resort in
                                dealing with the companies, could then extend to the whole
                                integrated company and its facilities inside and outside the
                                producing country. The Japanese company, which was the first to
                                accept the principle of integration in its concession for the
                                offshore areas in the Kuwait-Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone, has already
                                struck oil in promising quantities. If, as appears likely, the

                            <item>Recent developments have given new impetus to discussions of
                                cooperation between producing states. Arab oil experts have long
                                stressed the desirability of collaboration among themselves and with
                                non-Arab producers, such as Iran and Venezuela. An Arab tanker fleet
                                and an Arab pipeline have been discussed, but no progress has been
                                made to translate these schemes into action. We do not think that,
                                for the next several years at least, any effective joint action by
                                the producing states is likely to take place—chiefly because of
                                mutual jealousy and suspicion because of competing economic
                                interests. There is a possible exception to this in the field of
                                pricing. Being unable to accomplish anything individually, the
                                producing states will probably work more effectively through <gloss

                                international oil companies in regard to the pressures against them
                                are not easy to assess. The position of the companies is strong in
                                many ways. They have developed and control the vast and complex
                                apparatus in Western Europe, Africa, Asia, and America through which
                                most Middle East oil is actually marketed. This apparatus is beyond
                                the physical control of the producing countries. They cannot tax it,
                                nationalize it, or shut it down. The companies alone have the
                                enormous capital and technical ability required for the heavy
                                development and research activities required in every phase of the
                                oil industry. The negotiating positions of most of the European
                                companies are strengthened by the fact of their government’s
                                participation in their ownership and by the importance which their
                                governments place on continued access to Middle East oil.<note

                                one, and there is a limit to how far the companies can or will go in

                                The Iraq Petroleum Company is reducing its off-take from Basra
                                because of a heavy new port tax imposed there by the Iraqi
                                Government. The established companies have rejected requests from
                                the producing countries for a voice in pricing, and refuse to
                                consider integration. They view the 50/50 profit-sharing formula as
                                a benchmark of stability and insist that breaching it would lead to
                                a continuous spiral of governmental demands. However, the history of
                                negotiations in the Middle East shows that the companies have time
                                and again given in to or compromised substantially with demands

                                it is difficult to determine precisely how this surplus will affect

                                expands. However, with North African and Soviet oil playing a larger
                                role in the international oil trade, its share of the Western
                                European market is expected to decrease from 73 percent of the total

                                the halcyon days of spectacular annual increases in revenue are
                                probably over for the Middle Eastern countries. Revenues are apt to
                                grow only modestly and new rounds of price cuts—which are by no
                                means unlikely—could even lead to some diminution in the present

                                likely to permit over a period of time a larger participation of the
                                local government in management of producing companies. They will
                                resist vigorously the demand for integrated companies, chiefly
                                because most of the present producing companies are merely
                                instrumentalities of the parent companies set up for the purposes of

                                time for purposes of pressure. The governments of the producing
                                countries remember the experience of Mossadegh in Iran, and they are
                                unlikely to emulate him unless they become extremely aroused

                                made up by the Soviet Bloc. However, there may develop a kind of
                                “creeping” nationalization under which the companies gradually
                                retreat to a position where they are little more than managing

                                especially in the event of another outbreak of the Arab-Israeli
                                conflict; but we believe a lasting area-wide breakdown in the Middle
                                East oil situation is unlikely, at least for the period of this
                                estimate. Nevertheless, the balance of interest between the
                                desirability of developing alternate sources of oil to meet Western
                                Europe’s needs and the importance of assuring Middle Eastern
                                countries of sufficient oil revenues to avoid instability will
                                continue to pose problems for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>

                            <item>Other problems may emerge from possible conflicts of interest or
                                objectives between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and its
                                Western allies, especially the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                                France. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has in the past
                                considered it essential both strategically and economically to
                                retain a measure of political control over the oil-producing areas.
                                We believe the British now regard this policy as outmoded in large
                                measure, but it will remain possible that in a crisis situation they
                                might feel compelled to exert physical control over Kuwait. France
                                may come to feel that increasing availability of Saharan oil enables
                                it to take a harder line with the Arab states, who are generally
                                hostile to French interests as a result of France’s support of
                                Israel and repression of the Algerian rebels.</item>

                            <item>In addition, as the government of the producing countries gain
                                greater influence in the management of the oil industry, there will
                                probably be a growing number of cases in which their policies and
                                desires conflict with those of the Western governments. A problem of
                                this kind already exists, for example, in Saudi Arabia where the

                            <item>Another set of problems derives from the difficulty of determining
                                in particular circumstances whether and how <gloss target="#t_US1"

                                conflict. For example, the question of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> import restrictions will almost certainly come up
                                again during the period of this estimate, and policy makers will
                                have to weigh the relative importance of promoting a vigorous <gloss

                                Likewise, there will be questions involving the desires of certain
                                allied nations, e.g., Japan and Italy, to adopt import policies
                                designed to give preference to oil from producing companies run by
                                their own nationals, to the detriment of the British and American
                                companies and the general principles of reciprocal trade.</item>

                                The ultimate aim of some Middle Eastern officials and leaders is
                                probably an arrangement whereby the present concessionary interests
                                of the international oil companies in the area are eliminated and
                                Western companies act at most only as agents of the producing
                                countries. Such an arrangement would not necessarily preclude the
                                supply of sufficient oil for Western Europe and of sufficient
                                revenue for the Middle East. It might even alleviate certain
                                political problems which now confront the West in its relations with
                                the producing countries— especially those which stem from the close
                                association in the Middle Eastern mind of the companies with Western
                                governments.</item>

                            <item>Nevertheless, a surrender or large-scale withdrawal of Western
                                company interests under pressure would initially at least be
                                regarded as a setback for Western prestige. Liquidation of the role
                                traditionally played by the Western companies—even if they were
                                subsequently replaced by other arrangements—would almost certainly
                                result in some dislocation in the oil picture which would lend
                                itself to Soviet exploitation. Economic factors of major interest to
                                the West would also be involved, e.g., the loss of much of the
                                substantial increment to the balance of payments which the Western
                                oil companies now earn through their operations in the area.</item>

                        comments based on the attached statement<note n="1" xml:id="d318fn1">Printed

                        question of trade control criteria. Upon concluding his statement Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> of the Defense Department might
                        wish to comment more fully with respect to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> concepts and assumptions since the differing viewpoint on
                        the military aspects of the problem constituted an important element of the
                        problem. Mr. <persName>Thorold</persName> said that he was in agreement that
                        the question of the nature of <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0713"
                        />possible future war is important, particularly with respect to the
                        estimated duration of such war. He suggested that Mr.
                            <persName>Hosie</persName> who had come from London for the current
                        discussions might usefully expound the British position on this point.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said that he would like to
                        correct one point before Mr. <persName>Hosie</persName> presented the
                        British comments. He said that the matter of the duration of a possible war
                        was not actually the critical point of difference. He said that the real
                        focus of our concern is to avoid assisting the military-industrial capacity
                        of the Soviet bloc to build up during peacetime a force in being for use in
                        war. He said that to the degree the West contributes to the present
                        industrial capacity of the Soviet bloc it contributes to their basic
                        capability for war preparations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hosie</persName> explained that the British had come to the
                        viewpoint outlined in their December memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d318fn2"
                            >Not printed.</note> by a somewhat devious route. He said that their
                        point of view originated in a re-examination of their industrial
                        mobilization assumptions which actually began somewhat prior to 1954. He
                        said that the earlier British viewpoint with respect to industrial
                        mobilization had been the conventional assumption that there would have to
                        be reliance during a period of hostilities upon an adequate industrial base
                        which would be converted to military production gradually by stages after
                        the commencement of actual hostilities. The new British assumption, however,
                        was that they could not count upon defense production after “D Day” in the
                        United Kingdom if the type of warfare involved were thermonuclear in nature.
                        This general philosophy was applied in stages to various aspects of defense
                        planning. It was, for example, applied with general public knowledge in 1956
                        when it was announced that the British strategic stockpiling arrangements
                        should be replanned.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hosie</persName> said that the new British assumptions were
                        tied directly to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> assumptions. [<hi
                            rend="italic">11/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] He said
                        that the British had concluded that if it were true that the United Kingdom
                        could not plan on military-industrial production after “D Day” in a
                        thermonuclear war, it was likewise true that the Soviet Union could not
                        mount a massive military production program after “D Day”. Furthermore, the
                        British considered that it would logically follow that Soviet strategic
                        stockpiles accumulated prior to “D Day” would no longer have importance.
                        Their conclusion therefore with respect to the trade control program had
                        been that the multilateral controls were wrongly directed for conditions of
                        total war.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the conditions involved in limited warfare, Mr.
                            <persName>Hosie</persName> said the British likewise felt the trade
                        control program was misdirected and ineffective. [<hi rend="italic">61/2
                            lines of source text not declassified</hi>] It was inconceivable to the
                        British that there could be anything like a <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682"
                            facs="0714"/>limited war of long duration. It was clear, they felt, that
                        only in a limited war of long duration could productive capacity become a
                        significant factor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said that he found himself
                        agreeing with Mr. <persName>Hosie</persName>’s statement on many points but
                        that he disagreed on the basic premise which Mr. <persName>Hosie</persName>
                        had stated. He said that the United States does indeed consider the
                        mobilization base for production after the start of hostilities to be
                        important, but that the more important aspect is the capacity of the
                        Sino-Soviet bloc’s industrial potential <hi rend="italic">currently</hi> for
                        the creation of a force in being which might be drawn upon to launch either
                        limited or total warfare at some point in the future. Thus the United States
                        considers the Sino-Soviet military-industrial potential as it exists today
                        to be the critical element. With respect to the possibility of limited war,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said that the United
                        States still recognizes the possibility of limited hostilities of varying
                        duration both outside the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area and
                        inside the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area in terms of hostile
                        incursions. He said that he would emphasize the importance of the trade
                        control program in its bearing on Sino-Soviet capacity for conducting
                        economic warfare, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> had
                        pointed out in his opening statement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Thorold</persName> said that the British considered that what
                        the trade control program has been able to do thus far did not seem to have
                        affected either the Soviet ability to produce arms or their capacity to
                        engage in economic excursions in the uncommitted areas of the world. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that in making
                        reference to the Soviet effort at economic penetration, we had in mind not
                        trade simply in the sale of conventional arms but also trade in other
                        commodities and the provision of financial assistance by the bloc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Thorold</persName> said that in the British view the American
                        suggestion that the strategic controls might be shaped to some extent by
                        Western objectives with respect to counter measures in the face of Soviet
                        penetration went considerably beyond the existing concept of the
                        multilateral control system. He said that the British could not admit the
                        propriety of attempting to mount an economic war under the control system
                        for the purpose of crippling the Soviet general export capacity for dealing
                        with underdeveloped areas.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that a general economic
                        war on the Soviet Union was of course theoretically a possibility although
                        he did not suggest that precisely. We had in mind, he said, raising the
                        question of the extent to which the West should contribute to the
                        Sino-Soviet capability both for military preparations and for economic
                        activities in vulnerable areas of the world.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Ritchie</persName> said that he would raise a question as to
                        whether it had been agreed that the Soviet economic offensive in
                        underdeveloped countries should invariably be deplored by the West. He said
                        that the Canadians held the view that many things which the Soviets <pb
                            n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0715"/>do in terms of economic assistance
                        to underdeveloped countries should be welcomed because the West itself does
                        not possess the capability to meet in full the economic needs of such areas.
                        He said the Canadians were prepared to acknowledge that it would be highly
                        desirable if the West could in fact meet all such needs but felt that since
                        the West is not able to do so it should not feel undue concern if
                        underdeveloped countries look increasingly to the Soviet Union for such
                        assistance. He said that it appeared to Canada that any assistance from any
                        source which supplies the legitimate economic needs of underdeveloped areas
                        is in the interest of the West since the strength of the economies of such
                        countries works naturally in the direction of increasing their political
                        strength and independence. Thus he concluded that the economic assumptions
                        which had been suggested by the United States as a factor in reshaping the
                        international controls was of even more questionable validity than the
                        strategic assumptions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that of course the
                        United States was not opposed per se to the underdeveloped countries
                        receiving whatever economic benefits they are able to regardless of the
                        motivation of the donor. The problem with Soviet economic aid, as we see it,
                        is that the increase of trade and financial arrangements between the Soviet
                        bloc and the underdeveloped countries carries with it an undesirable
                        increase in Soviet political influence. We deplore the latter because it may
                        lose us the uncommitted areas of the world.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Ritchie</persName> said that Canada was disposed to agree with
                        the United Kingdom that it goes far afield to look at export controls as a
                        matter of counter measures to Soviet economic penetration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> emphasized the American view
                        that it is not possible to divorce these two aspects. In this period of cold
                        war our objective is to build up the deterrents to hostilities through
                        restraining both Soviet military and Soviet political power. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_JGL1">Jones</persName> endorsed this point, adding that the
                        question of economic warfare was discussed with the United Kingdom at the
                        time of the Eisenhower–<persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
                            talks<note n="3" xml:id="d318fn3">Apparent reference to the Bermuda
                            Conference, March 21–23. See <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,
                                1955–1957</hi>, vol. x, pp. 434–438.</note> with a view to
                        developing effective joint action in the face of Soviet activities in
                        underdeveloped areas. He said it might indeed be true that economic blockade
                        of the Soviet Union would be an extreme measure which it is not practical to
                        consider. At the same time we are convinced that strategic controls cannot
                        be operated in a vacuum. They are a part of the West’s total position of
                        strength vis-à-vis the Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJHJ1">Smith</persName> (of Commerce) noted that in
                        the discussion of Soviet resort to limited warfare there had been no
                        reference to the situation of Communist China. He said it seemed clear that
                        the West should still <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0716"/>have concern
                        at what Communist China might do with Soviet support in pursuing limited
                        warfare outside the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area. Since
                        Communist China is in the Sino-Soviet bloc, the importance of the
                        Sino-Soviet industrial base takes on added significance because of the more
                        conventional nature of Chinese military technique. Since an industrial base
                        is potentially more flexible and less subject to obsolescence than a
                        stockpile of military items, the building up of such a base on as strong a
                        basis as possible must represent a prime objective for Communist China.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hosie</persName> said that so far as Chinese aggression was
                        involved, he felt it was still valid to assume that the defense pacts such
                        as <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> would inevitably draw the
                        European and Western hemisphere countries into such hostilities. Because of
                        the very fact of the conventional equipment at the disposal of the Chinese,
                        such an aggression could be halted rapidly unless the Soviet supplies
                        nuclear bombs. In the latter event the hostilities would mushroom into
                        global war. Mr. <persName>Clough</persName> pointed out that there remains
                        in the picture the element of Chinese capacity for miscalculation and that
                        this might have a bearing on the course of events.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> pointed out that the
                        British still seemed to exclude the importance of the present mobilization
                        base as a relevant factor in the picture. He said that the United States
                        still considers it important to identify the parts of the industrial complex
                        which are critical to an offensive military-industrial base and to impose
                        controls in those areas. He said that of course the United States is
                        prepared to review this sort of coverage, to make adjustments in it and in
                        essence to place the international controls on the basis of a 1958 model
                        rather than a 1953 or 1954 model.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hosie</persName> said that the British do not entirely exclude
                        the element of peacetime industrial capacity so long as such capacity is
                        related to the development of a thermonuclear capability. He said that of
                        course in a sense the diversion of Soviet resources to produce materials for
                        underdeveloped countries keeps the Soviets away from outright military
                        production.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said that of course this
                        raised a range of other considerations which would place a question mark
                        beside such a simplified conclusion. For example, there would be the effect
                        on the Soviet satellites of diverting resources to underdeveloped areas
                        which might be required within the bloc itself for essential civilian
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Garran</persName> said that apart from the question of the
                        criteria as such, it seemed to him that the real issue was whether the
                        United States agreed with the assumptions which underly the criteria.
                        Specifically, he referred to paragraph 8 of the British memorandum and
                        inquired whether the United States could accept that enumeration of
                        objectives.</p>
                    <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0717"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that the United States
                        could at least provide the British with its views on criteria although it
                        did not appear likely that agreement could be quickly reached on their
                        interpretation. He suggested that there be further discussions between the
                        British and Canadian defense elements and the American defense people. It
                        was agreed such talks would take place. Mr. <persName>Thorold</persName> and
                        Mr. <persName>Jackling</persName> pointed out that an examination of the
                        military elements would not get us very far since the question would remain
                        of whether or not we are discussing economic warfare. It remained the
                        British view that the question at issue is that of the controls over
                        strategic materials moving to the Soviet bloc and that a discussion of a
                        limitation upon the Soviet economy as a whole would be out of order. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said it was not a matter
                        of attacking the economy “as a whole”. Mr. <persName>Jackling</persName>
                        said that nonetheless the issue would remain of how far to go beyond the
                        strict military area.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that a meeting would be scheduled in Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName>’s office in the Pentagon for
                        January 16 at 10 a.m.<note n="4" xml:id="d318fn4">No record of such a

                        concerning the discussion raised by other participating governments or by
                        the press would be dealt with on the basis of the agreed <gloss

                            xml:id="d318fn5">On January 24, Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> outlined for Senator John Sparkman
                            this exploratory conversation with the British. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> stated that the Department had
                            subsequently received an embargo list from the British which was a great
                            deal shorter than the United States draft list. The British list
                            concentrated on electronic and chemical categories, but made wide
                            deletions in other categories such as nonferrous metals, machinery, and
                            equipment. In general, <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>
                            informed Sparkman that there was a wide gap between the United States
                            and United Kingdom on the basic philosophy of the control system.
                            Sparkman stated that the United States “tended to be a little too rigid
                            on the trade control question” and urged compromise with the British and
                            other allies. Sparkman saw trade as a means of increased understanding
                            and improving relations between East and West and therefore saw no need
                            to embargo commodities which added to the economic or industrial base of
                            the Soviet bloc. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> pointed out
                            that many commodities had dual military and industrial applications,
                            such as copper. Sparkman recognized the problem. At <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>’s request, Sparkman estimated that
                            most Americans who had an opinion on the issue and most members of
                            Congress would support a “moderate line” on trade controls. (Department

                        <p>We have studied the memorandum on “Revision of the Strategic Criteria”
                            prepared by the United Kingdom and appreciate their explanation of the
                            assumptions underlying the specific wording of their proposed new
                            criteria. We believe the British and Canadian representatives are
                            entitled to a similar general exposition of the American thinking on
                            this matter.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that a re-examination of the multilateral strategic trade
                            controls would be timely and we welcome an opportunity to discuss this
                            matter. We consider the trade controls to be an integral part of the

                                >NATO</gloss> and the associated bilateral and multilateral defense
                            arrangements. We agree that the trade control program must be based
                            firmly on the strategic concepts prevailing in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">6½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>] The
                            trade control program, in order to be consistent with current <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> concepts, should therefore be
                            directed at inhibiting the ability of the Sino-Soviet bloc to create and
                            further the development of a force in being and to sustain the Soviet
                            bloc military efforts, once hostilities have begun, during the second
                            phase of indeterminate duration.</p>
                        <p>We are pleased to note in paragraph 6 of the British memorandum that we
                            seem to be in agreement that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            concepts require us to mount an effort through the strategic trade
                            controls to hinder the Soviet bloc and Communist China in the
                            accumulation of the nuclear weapons and the means of their delivery for
                            a global offensive and in their development of defensive
                            counter-measures. To us this pinpoints the importance of the current
                            industrial base in the Sino-Soviet bloc and its capacity to produce the
                            weapons necessary to mount either an all out nuclear war or a war of
                            limited area. Thus we feel that the importance of trade controls as they
                            relate to a mobilization base is more their effect on the base now in
                            being in the Soviet bloc than upon the bloc’s capacity to mobilize
                            industry after the outbreak of war. We think the size of a Soviet
                            nuclear stockpile at the outbreak of a war marked by intense nuclear
                            exchange is less significant than the current industrial mobilization
                            base or capacity of the Sino-Soviet bloc to create and sustain effective
                            forces in being which could be employed <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687"
                                facs="0719"/>by the bloc in military operations. Thus any raw
                            materials or products which currently help to expand current Sino-Soviet
                            bloc industrial capacity contribute directly or indirectly to improving
                            its war-making potential and the posture of its military force.</p>
                        <p>Against this background of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            assumptions and strategic concepts, it is somewhat puzzling to us to see
                            the British conclusion in paragraph 2 of their memorandum [<hi
                                rend="italic">6 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. It is
                            likewise puzzling to see the British suggestion in paragraph 5 of their
                            memorandum that because of the importance attached to the concept of a
                            short initial phase of global war, there should no longer be need for
                            the trade controls to concern themselves over the expansion of
                            Sino-Soviet industrial capacity and the accumulation of raw materials;
                            the sole concern of the trade controls rather should be to hamper the
                            Sino-Soviet bloc in the accumulation of nuclear weapons and the means
                            for their delivery in a global offensive.</p>
                        <p>The United States cannot subscribe to this thesis. It seems to us to base
                            the trade controls on a partial and hence defective view of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategic concepts.</p>
                        <p>We are pleased to note in paragraph 7 of the British note agreement that
                            it would be unrealistic not to take account of political objections to
                            the export even of conventional weapons together with that of materials
                            which are essential to the utilization of machinery and materials whose
                            primary function is the production of arms, and of know-how which
                            improves the quality or output of such arms. Whereas nuclear weapons may
                            or may not be of more importance in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> area for possible use in war, certainly the ability to
                            provide conventional weapons in other less developed areas of the world
                            increases the Soviet capacity for creating trouble, unrest and
                            revolution in these areas. It might specifically be noted that in the
                            Far East where the United States bears a heavy defense burden pursuant
                            to collective security arrangements for deterring Communist aggression,
                            limited war, and even non-nuclear war, are still possibilities to be
                            reckoned with. It may be many years before Communist China has any
                            significant nuclear capability and in the meantime it is essential to
                            limit Chinese Communist ability to wage conventional war.</p>
                        <p>Beyond the shipment of weapons as such, the current Soviet industrial
                            base also has relevance to Soviet economic warfare or economic
                            penetration activities in the underdeveloped countries. It would seem
                            that the ability of the Soviet to conduct such operations would depend
                            directly on the size and build up of the current industrial base. It
                            would likewise seem clear that it would be unwise for the West to be
                            taking measures to counter Soviet intervention in key areas while at the
                            same time shipping freely to the Soviet bloc commodities which
                            facilitate such intervention.</p>
                        <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0720"/>
                        <p>There is one further point which merits comment. In their first criterion
                            the British refer to the necessity to control materials and equipment
                            designed specifically or “in peacetime used principally” for the
                            development of arms. It would seem to us that use of the phrase “in
                            peacetime” would substantially nullify the purpose of this criterion
                            since it would have the effect of exempting from control materials and
                            equipment which are not used exclusively or almost exclusively for the
                            production of arms during peacetime. The only materials or equipment
                            used principally for the development, production or utilization of arms
                            in peacetime would seem to be the most highly specialized machines
                            installed in arsenals or naval gun factories, for example. This seems to
                            us much too limited a concept of military production for purposes of an
                            effective trade control program, particularly against the background of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> concepts and assumptions to
                            which I have referred earlier.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said the U.S. had now
                        introduced a new theory into the problem of strategic trade controls,
                        namely, limitation of the growth of the Soviet industrial base. He thought
                        the China List had been a good example of how to handle the matter. U.S.
                        action in that case had resolved the whole problem for him and he was no
                        longer attacked with complaints about the U.S. attitude on China. Some of
                        his colleagues, he continued, thought we should seek to improve relations
                        with the Soviet Union through trade. He thought it unlikely you would really
                        widen the Soviet industrial base very much by relaxing <pb n="689"
                            xml:id="pg_689" facs="0721"/>trade controls. The Czechs were offering
                        for sale in the U.K. certain machine tools that were on the list. He thought
                        a little more trade would probably be a good thing.</p>
                    <p>Sir William Hayter observed that the Soviet industrial base was so large that
                        it was questionable whether one could make any significant effect on it,
                        while at the same time the internal level of consumption was so
                        depressed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said his own disposition which he believed was also that of the
                        President was to take a more liberal view of this general matter. Yet the
                        U.S. Government was up against violent opposition in Congress. Furthermore,
                        there was the problem of the Battle Act<note n="2" xml:id="d319fn2">The
                            Battle Act, formally entitled the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act
                            of 1951, stipulated that U.S. military, economic, and financial
                            assistance be terminated to a nation which knowingly permitted shipments
                            of an embargoed item to a country threatening the security of the United
                            States. (65 Stat. 644)</note> which became operative if an item were
                        removed from the international list without U.S. agreement. The Secretary
                        said that we had considered the copper wire exports to the Soviet Union a
                        serious business because it had facilitated their putting their
                        communications underground. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>
                        replied that this trade in copper had meant 20 million pounds for the
                        economy of Southern Rhodesia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> believed it was not possible
                        for the U.S. and the U.K. to resolve their difference in this field through
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>. He agreed it must be done at a
                        higher level and he hoped it would be possible to get together before the
                        February meeting. He had heard that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> was coming to London shortly for some meeting and
                        thought that might be a good opportunity to deal with the matter.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said he understood that at

                        controls. There were indications that the U. K. would propose (1)
                        elimination of 43% of the items on List I, exclusive of <gloss

                        items; (3) elimination of Lists II and III entirely. Mr. <persName

                        it was no longer worthwhile through trade controls to attempt to slow down

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA2">Herter</persName> said the U. K.
                        proposals were likely to lead to very serious differences between the United
                        States and the United Kingdom. He did not know to what extent the U. K. had
                        communicated its views to other governments, but in any case there appeared
                        to be in the making a plot to under-cut <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> and leave the United States holding the bag. This was a
                        serious situation striking at the concept of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> interdependence.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said he had addressed
                        memoranda on this subject to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName> and to the Secretary of Commerce. (A copy of Mr.

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Foster</hi> is with respect to the proposal of the
                        British that the trade controls with the Sino-Soviet bloc be once more
                        sharply reduced.</p>
                    <p>Some two weeks ago, when I first heard of this matter, I asked Douglas Dillon
                        to send me a letter framing the issue, so that I might put in motion the
                        procedures of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy. Sensing urgency, I
                        then had in mind appointing a small committee at the Assistant-Secretary
                        level from the sensitive departments to review the matter on about a
                        five-day crash basis.</p>
                    <p>Soon after I received an urgent letter from Bobby Cutler,<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d321fn1">Reference is presumably to the memorandum from
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> cited in <ref
                                target="#d320fn3">footnote 3, Document 320</ref>.</note> asking me
                        to start.</p>
                    <p>The letter from Douglas did not come, however, and last Saturday he
                        telephoned me,<note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">No other record of this February
                            1 telephone conversation has been found.</note> asking me not to
                        initiate these proceedings, and explaining that you preferred to bring the
                        matter directly to the President in a meeting in which Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName>, myself, and others would
                        participate.</p>
                    <p>Without disclosing that this was your purpose, I therefore informed Bobby
                        Cutler, and others, that you had asked that the matter be deferred until
                        your return, saying that I felt this was an altogether reasonable
                        request.</p>
                    <p>Because I leave tomorrow afternoon for a short vacation in Arizona with my
                        wife, and because of your indisposition today, I thought you would not mind
                        if I put my ideas on paper.</p>
                    <p>On the main substantive question, I am a liberal. I hold the strong
                        conviction that this matter must not be allowed to disrupt <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> unity. I think we should bargain out the
                        best deal we can with the British, holding the maximum degree of control
                        that good negotiation will produce, but I would be prepared to go the whole
                        distance to meet their viewpoint rather than risk the serious consequences
                        of an open rupture.</p>
                    <p>I am sure that you understand how deep the differences are within our
                        Government on this subject. It is one of the most difficult problems I have
                        had to handle since I have been here.</p>
                    <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0724"/>
                    <p>For myself, I accept readily your taking the question directly to the
                        President, but there are many who will be disturbed at this. Their
                        grievances would be mitigated were they to be overruled after the matter had
                        gone through the regular procedures.</p>
                    <p>Since I will not be available next week, when no doubt you will be moving on
                        this, I shall appreciate it if you or Doug will let me have a memorandum as
                        to what policy is established.</p>
                    <p>As I have said to Doug, the activities of the Council on Foreign Economic
                        Policy will not be suspended because of my absence. Colonel <persName

                        deals with an economic question, Gabe Hauge will chair a meeting. If it is a
                        security matter, Bobby Cutler will chair a meeting.</p>

                        that it is imperative to undertake a complete review of the philosophy

                            >USSR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had argued
                        that the Soviet Union was now a very powerful industrial state which was
                        quite capable itself of waging economic warfare. Therefore, it was out of
                        date for the Western powers to try to prevent the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> from becoming an industrial power by the restrictions we
                        placed on trade. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> felt that we
                        should, of course, maintain our controls over items of clear military
                        importance; but that anything like an economic <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693"
                            facs="0725"/>blockade was out-dated. All that we gained was a reservoir
                        of ill will in the allied countries, an ill will which was not

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that <persName

                        proposing should be made at a high level. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then expressed the view that the
                        United States should review its own position prior to the <gloss

                        personally inclined to feel that there was a good deal in <persName

                    <p>The President added that his views on the futility of much of our trade

                    <p>Mr. Gore-Booth said that he wanted to consider the matter of strategic
                        controls. He had prepared himself for the discussion by going through the
                        whole story with his people in London. He observed that changes in this
                        field usually come by spasms and that we appeared to be due for another one.
                        He noted that the United States and the United Kingdom are some distance
                        apart in their positions. There were three aspects of the matter which he
                        wished to discuss: (1) strategic concepts, (2) political considerations and
                        (3) economic effect. In connection <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0730"
                        />with the first, he referred to certain military strategic concepts which
                        have been approved in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He pointed out
                        that the British military establishment has given full endorsement to these
                        concepts, and he noted that the U.S. had also approved them in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. [<hi rend="italic">71/2 lines of source
                            text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gore-Booth then discussed the political aspect of strategic controls. He
                        said that the clamor for commercial opportunities in England has stimulated
                        a demand for relaxation of controls, which, when coupled with general
                        impressions of the technological achievements of the Soviet Union, made it
                        impossible for the government to take a position favoring the status quo for
                        controls, or a more rigid system. He said that he recognized that a
                        relaxation of controls would not, in fact, bring much growth in trade, and
                        that the political point was primarily psychological.</p>
                    <p>He then turned to the economic aspect of controls and said that his
                        impression from the material presented to him was that the U.S. favored a
                        broad program of economic warfare. The British question was whether you
                        could do very much damage to the Soviet Union by this process. He noted that
                        some of the goods now being embargoed by western countries are also being
                        exported by the Soviet Union, such as aluminum. He said that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had recently talked with economic experts of
                        all the Commonwealth countries, and had discovered that none of these
                        countries would go along with any kind of general program of economic
                        warfare and, indeed, felt that underdeveloped countries needed Soviet aid.
                        Consequently, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is convinced, both from
                        its commercial contacts and its own experience, that a wholesale approach to
                        deterring Soviet growth and development would not work. He also noted that,
                        while the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was much interested in
                        preventing Soviet economic penetration of underdeveloped areas, it did not
                        feel that there was any likelihood of intensified trade controls having any
                        effect on Soviet capabilities in this field. Furthermore, in most cases the
                        underdeveloped countries themselves were sophisticated about dealing with
                        the Russians.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said in response that he
                        was pleased to have the opportunity to clarify the U.S. views on this
                        matter. He noted that the discussion of List II quotas last autumn had led
                        the U.S. to conclude that there was need for a new look at the whole control
                        picture, and this intensive review had proceeded within the government for
                        several months. The review was not focused on criteria, which have generally
                        been dedicated toward blocking the Soviet military effort, and no
                        significant changes in criteria have been or are being proposed by the U.S.
                        The emphasis of the U.S. effort during the past several months had been on
                        developing a set of proposals for modifying the lists, which would
                        correspond to the best intelligence data and the latest expert opinion on
                        technical and military implications. The result of <pb n="699"
                            xml:id="pg_699" facs="0731"/>this examination had been to remove a lot
                        of items from the list, including, for example, items which the Soviet Union
                        itself exports. We had proposed a very few items for embargo which had
                        previously been on List II because the new list applies as a whole to
                        Communist China as well as the Soviet Union, and there are special items,
                        such as jet fuel, in which Communist China is deficient and the Soviet Union
                        is not. We feel, in view of our special defense responsibilities in the Far
                        Eastern area, that it is necessary to limit the supply of jet fuel in the
                        hands of the Chinese Communists. We had nevertheless proposed dropping List
                        II as a general concept, and had proposed that we retain List III, under a
                        modified set of ground rules.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then said that Mr.
                        Gore-Booth’s remarks had shown that there is a real difference of opinion in
                        military thought and concept, which is at the root of the difference of
                        opinion between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> regarding the
                        level, nature, and purpose of controls. We had originally thought that the
                        entire pressure for modification of controls within the British Government
                        originated in the Board of Trade for commercial reasons, but we were now
                        interested to learn that the British position was based on the position of
                        the Ministry of Defense. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        noted that we certainly agree that priority in attention should be given to
                        the items which would contribute to the availability on D Day of goods and
                        equipment, but our Chiefs of Staff also believe that we should not neglect
                        items which would be useful in a period subsequent to the initial
                        thermonuclear exchange. Also, they feel that the military industrial
                        potential is most important in connection with the possibility of
                        conventional or semi-conventional warfare in the area of the Middle East or
                        Far East, although we recognize the improbability of conventional or
                        semi-conventional warfare in the European area. Consequently, from a
                        military standpoint we feel that exclusive emphasis on the point selected by
                        the British Ministry of Defense is incorrect, and that a proper military
                        view should also take into account supplies for the subsequent period and
                        the capacity of the Sino-Soviet military industrial complex to wage
                        conventional warfare, especially in Asia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then dealt with the
                        political problems of the Executive Branch in dealing with this matter. He
                        noted that the whole Mutual Security concept is based on the theory that it
                        is a bulwark against Soviet expansion. He said that a substantial open break
                        between the U.S. and its allies over trade controls, or an agreement on the
                        part of the U.S. to a serious downward reduction of trade controls, might
                        well lead to considerable harm to the aid program at a time of crucial
                        importance in its consideration by the Congress. He did not wish to hazard a
                        guess regarding the results. He observed further that this problem is
                        different from the problem regarding the China differential, <pb n="700"
                            xml:id="pg_700" facs="0732"/>because it has to do with the nature of our
                        general policy toward the Sino-Soviet Bloc, and not with a question of a
                        difference of opinion regarding one aspect of the whole problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then went on to consider
                        the relationship of strategic controls to Sino-Soviet economic penetration
                        of the underdeveloped areas. He said our views were not too different from
                        those of the British. We think that this is the most serious aspect of our
                        struggle with the Soviet Union at this time. He emphasized that we do not
                        believe in broad-scale economic warfare but rather in a selective approach.
                        He said our proposals were designed precisely for this purpose. He added
                        that we have no intention of suggesting to third countries that they do not
                        engage in trade with or accept aid from the Soviet Union. Our domestic
                        problem of obtaining approval for trade agreements legislation and of
                        obtaining funds for foreign aid are closely related, however, to the
                        question of a general western policy response to the Soviet economic
                        challenge, and it is difficult to persuade people of this if we are at the
                        same time asked to agree to a serious and damaging modification of
                        controls.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> concluded his remarks by
                        saying that obviously the U.S. did not wish any open break on this issue,
                        and that some ground for agreement must be found. He said that he had a
                        personal feeling that it was much easier to deal with this matter in terms
                        of an item by item approach to the lists, rather than to argue one theory or
                        another. He said we are considering the whole matter at the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> level to determine whether there is any
                        basis for arriving at some form of compromise position. He did hope that the
                        British position has sufficient latitude so that, given a willingness to
                        arrive at an agreement, there can be some mutually agreeable compromise.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gore-Booth said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s
                        statement of the U.S. position had made the matter very much clearer, and he
                        could see that a good deal of the argument turned on the question of what is
                        a strategic material. He had noted that the U.S. proposal called for a
                        reduction of about 29 items from the 181 in List I. He said that the British
                        view was that the list could be approximately cut in half to about 93. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that an American
                        reading of the British paper had led to the conclusion that the British had
                        intended to abolish the list entirely, except for 31 items, whereas we felt
                        we were making a significant reduction in proposing the elimination of about
                        40 items, rather than 29. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        and Mr. Gore-Booth agreed that further analysis by both the U.S. and <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would be useful in determining the extent to
                        which there is a real disparity in position. He commented wryly that while
                        it is in the U.S. interest to take as long as possible to work out the
                        situation, because of pressures it is to the British interest to conclude
                        the matter as rapidly as possible.</p>
                    <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0733"/>
                    <p>Mr. Moline said that he thought the discussion had thus far failed to mention
                        one significant aspect, which is that too much emphasis on what both sides
                        would have available on D Day, or thereafter, overlooks the need to consider
                        the material and technical position of the two sides in the period before D
                        Day. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> emphasized the
                        importance of this point.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gore-Booth raised a question as to whether it was in our power to do very
                        much with this problem, in terms of restraining the Soviet Union. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that further
                        analysis of the impact of the trade control program was always in order, but
                        noted that U.S. intelligence sources indicate that the program has been
                        effective in restraining Soviet growth and development. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> raised the question as to whether the
                        western world should act in such a way as to facilitate meeting the needs of
                        the Soviet population, or of Communist China, or whether it should move in
                        the opposite direction. Mr. Gore-Booth said that he wondered whether the
                        trade control device was the right piece of machinery, assuming that it was
                        our objective not to facilitate meeting the needs of the Soviet
                        population.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and Mr. Gore-Booth agreed
                        that it was desirable to avoid endless argument on criteria, and that it
                        would be advisable for both sides to take a mild attitude on the question of
                        criteria at the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> discussion beginning
                        on the 20th. Mr. Gore-Booth said his government would consider U.S. views
                        seriously and respond in due course. He could not predict the reaction of
                        his Ministry of Defense. He would consider whether the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could put emphasis on the list review. It was
                        noted that care would have to be taken regarding the sensitivities of the
                        French, and possibly those of other countries concerning the situation. It
                        was agreed that the best place for technical discussions was <gloss

                            telegram 891 to Moscow, February 14, the Department requested the
                            Embassy’s estimate “whether partial relaxation of control by Western
                            countries could be employed with Soviets in order concessions in other
                            fields.” In effect, the cable continued, the Department wanted
                            information on which to base a judgment on what quid pro quo might be
                            obtained from the Soviets in exchange if controls were removed.
                            (Department of State, Central Files, 460.509/2–1458)</note> Soviets have
                        shown continuing strong interest in removal obstacles to trade which
                        doubtless due to economic as well as political reasons. Regarding former,
                        need for machinery for automation, materials in short supply particularly in
                        non-ferrous metals field, and increased access to Western technology are
                        important factors. In political field Soviets have always been sensitive to
                        any discrimination against them and are acutely conscious of relationship
                        between economic and political questions.</p>
                    <p>In view Soviet knowledge of pressures in West for relaxation of controls
                        would appear difficult if not impossible exact any specific quid pro quo. A
                        bargain of this nature might be possible in the course of general
                        discussions on easing international tensions such as an eventual summit
                        conference, in which case relaxation of controls might be tossed into the
                        scales against such Soviet concessions as termination jamming Western
                        broadcasts. If impossible hold the line with our Western allies pending such
                        conference believe we might at least gain some advantage by informal
                        discussion with Mikoyan in which we would indicate our readiness work toward
                        relaxation of controls in return for some Soviet concession, although I find
                        it difficult to suggest what concession we should seek. As a minimum we
                        might suggest Soviet cooperation in orderly trading procedures. For domestic
                        reasons I would assume that we would not seek a specific exchange which
                        would be made public but rather that the approach would be that following
                        upon the conclusion of the agreement on exchanges as we are prepared to work
                        for a further relaxation of tension and are prepared to take some steps
                        toward relaxation trade controls. On the other hand we hope that Soviets
                        will make a contribution, for example, moderating their propaganda against
                        West, relaxation <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0735"/>in restrictions on
                        granting exit permits to dual citizens and close relatives of American
                        citizens, easing travel controls, avoiding disruption international or some
                        other such concession. For such approach to be effective suggest it should
                        be made promptly before Soviets become aware that relaxation of controls is
                        probably inevitable.</p>

                    <p>Upon entering the Cabinet Room ten minutes late, the President commented with
                        a smile that national security affairs occasionally had to give way when

                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> with respect to the U.S. position in the
                        current <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> negotiations, particularly
                        as they concerned the U.K. proposal for a drastic reduction in the existing
                        levels of multilateral controls on trade with the Sino-Soviet bloc. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> concluded his briefing by
                        pointing out that the basic issue confronting the United States in the
                        current <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> negotiations was whether:
                        (1) to be more influenced by the objective of maintaining what the United
                        States considers to be an effective multilateral control system, or (2) to
                        be more influenced by the objective of achieving a unified allied position
                        with respect to the level of multilateral controls (having in mind the
                        possibility of an upcoming Summit Meeting). He also noted that the State and
                        Commerce Departments, in the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>, wished
                        general authority to negotiate downward from the agreed position of the
                        Economic Defense Advisory Committee (<gloss target="#t_EDAC1">EDAC</gloss>).
                        Defense, on the other hand, wished instead to hold substantially to the
                            <gloss target="#t_EDAC1">EDAC</gloss> position for the present, and to
                        develop alternatives to the <gloss target="#t_EDAC1">EDAC</gloss> position
                        only after (a) there had been an attempt to reconcile international
                        differences at a meeting of the policy-level Consultative Group, and then
                        only after (b) a determination by the Secretary of State that further
                        pursuit of U.S. objectives would endanger important U.S. mutual security
                        relationships.</p>
                    <p>In the course of his briefing, General <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> also noted the continuing views of the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff to the effect that any further erosion of international trade
                        controls must be viewed as “imposing an increasing threat to our national
                        and collective security by virtue of its direct contribution to Bloc
                        military build-up.” (A copy of General <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                            >Cutler</persName>’s briefing note, together with a statement entitled
                        “Comparison of Present International Control Lists, Lists Proposed by U.K.,

                    <p>Upon concluding his briefing, General <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> called first upon Secretary Dulles, who stated that
                        he was dissatisfied with both the position taken by State-Commerce as well
                        as the position taken by the Department of Defense in the discussion of this
                        problem in the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>. He therefore wished to
                        present an alternative position, which went further in the direction of
                        liberalization than either of the other two. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed great doubt as to whether
                        the military potential of the Sino-Soviet bloc was appreciably affected by
                        Western controls on trade with the bloc (assuming, of course, that we
                        maintain controls on certain generally agreed items).</p>
                    <p>In explaining this doubt, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> went on to state that a nation as strong as the
                        Soviet Union, and one as capable of giving priority to military needs, would
                        encounter virtually no impairment of its military power through the
                        imposition of trade controls by the Free <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705"
                            facs="0737"/>World states. In illustration of this, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reminded the Council of the
                        widely-held and quite mistaken view at the outset of World War II, that
                        Germany was incapable of fighting a long-drawn-out war.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out further
                        that all our U.S. military planning is based on the assumption that if
                        general war breaks out it will be a nuclear war and that, accordingly, it
                        would be of relatively short duration. He believed that our economic
                        planning should be kept in line with the above assumption underlying our
                        military plans.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that of course
                        he recognized that elimination of controls on some of the items presently
                        controlled would help the Soviet Union to accelerate slightly its current
                        rate of industrial development—as, for example, in providing automation more
                        rapidly. On the other hand, this may be a good thing or it may be a bad
                        thing, in terms of keeping the peace. It was quite possible that the more
                        rapid development of the Soviet industrial base would not turn Soviet policy
                        to more peaceful ends, but rather would increase its capability to wage
                        effective economic or political warfare against the Free World, although the
                        Secretary was inclined to doubt it. Furthermore, we should remember that
                        trade is a two-way proposition. When we trade with the Soviet bloc we do not
                        give things away; there has to be an exchange of goods and advantages.</p>
                    <p>All this was one side of the picture. Beyond this side, however, we must
                        remember that we are obliged to think of the impact of our policy on trade
                        controls as it affected our alliances; not only the obvious impact on <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, but the impact on other allied countries
                        like those in Latin America, for example. In the face of an economic
                        recession in the United States, with the resultant severe impact on
                        industrial activity, it was going to be increasingly difficult to induce
                        other countries to maintain restraints on their trade with the Soviet bloc
                        when they feel they need to trade with bloc countries. As an illustration,
                        we might take copper. The world price of copper is now approximately half
                        what it has been. This works a very great hardship on countries like Chile
                        and Peru, which depend on the sale of their copper. We would be in a
                        difficult position if we find ourselves obliged to raise a protective tariff
                        on imports of copper, while at the same time being obliged to insist that
                        Chile and Peru refuse to sell their copper to Soviet bloc nations.</p>
                    <p>As for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the pressure to trade with the
                        Soviet bloc would become irresistible if there is any considerable recession
                        in the United States. If we take an isolated position on this issue, our
                        cordial relations with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies and
                        other allies will be seriously endangered. For all these reasons, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he would personally
                        go further than the positions outlined in the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> paper which was now before the Council. He would favor
                        more liberal trade policies <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0738"/>than
                        this paper envisaged. He did not think that the negotiating position in
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> proposed for the United States
                        in this paper was sound—a negotiating position which amounted to prolonged
                        wrangling over each item, with appeal to the three Cabinet Members (the
                        Secretaries of State, Defense and Commerce). In support of this latter view,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reminded the Council
                        of the bitterness which had been occasioned in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> by the battle over the elimination of the China
                        differential, particularly on the part of the British. Before the China
                        differential had been eliminated, the British had been in the habit of
                        blaming us for the fact that trade between the United Kingdom and Communist
                        China was of negligible size. Now that the differential has been removed and
                        the trade is still not very notable in volume, the British must blame the
                        Chinese Communists rather than ourselves.</p>
                    <p>When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had concluded
                        his observations, the President spoke up to state that in five long years
                        this was the first time that a voice had been raised in support of his, the
                        President’s, position on the issue of controls on trade with the Soviet
                        bloc, which for the most part he had considered damned silly practices
                        (laughter).</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> addressed himself to
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and said that he
                        understood that in favoring liberalizing the controls on trade with the
                        Soviet bloc, the Secretary would still maintain the controls on war-making
                        items. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied in
                        the affirmative, whereupon General <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> summed up the Secretary’s position as in general
                        following closely the British position. Both the President and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that this was
                        correct, generally speaking; the President adding that of course we would
                        continue to control shipment of scarce items, of which we were the sole
                        producers, to the Soviet bloc. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> agreed with this proposal, and added that we would
                        also negotiate the controls on an item-by-item basis rather than on a
                        category basis, as the British desired.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then called on Mr.
                        Walter Williams, the Acting Secretary of Commerce. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WW2">Williams</persName> indicated that while he was
                        somewhat intimidated by the force of the views of the President and the
                        Secretary of State, he still felt that he must make his differing position
                        clear. He believed that the issue was essentially a matter of protecting
                        ourselves by refusing to provide an enemy with items which are potentially
                        useful and helpful, especially items involving advanced technology. He then
                        added that he had four main points which he wished to make.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, it seemed to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WW2"
                            >Williams</persName> that it was not necessary, as the <gloss
                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> paper suggested, to make a choice between
                        maintaining an effective multilateral control system or achieving a unified
                        allied position with respect to control levels. We don’t want merely either
                        one or the other of these desiderata; we want both. Our <pb n="707"
                            xml:id="pg_707" facs="0739"/>negotiating approach should be to sift the
                        list of items carefully, make up our minds which items should be controlled,
                        and then do a job of selling our U.K. associates on our list.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WW2">Williams</persName> wanted to
                        ask whether our past efforts to maintain controls on trade with the Soviet
                        bloc had been effective. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WW2"
                            >Williams</persName> maintained that these efforts would seem to have
                        been effective, because of the evidence of Soviet procurement through
                        clandestine trade and activity. So eager had been the Soviet Union to obtain
                        certain scarce items which had been controlled, that there was evidence that
                        they had paid five times the original price of the items they desired.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WW2">Williams</persName> cited certain
                        instances—Soviet deficiencies in copper have been and remain very serious;
                        so also was their deficiency in hydraulic industrial presses, where the
                        United States was far ahead of them. Do we really want to make our
                        technology and know-how in such areas available to the Sino-Soviet bloc?</p>
                    <p>At this point the President interrupted to ask what the argument was about.
                        We were all agreed that items such as those mentioned by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WW2">Williams</persName> should be embargoed to the bloc.
                        The President emphasized that he had never argued that we would simply
                        accept the British list of items to be decontrolled.</p>
                    <p>On the same subject, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        stated that of course he was not competent to judge the particular items
                        that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WW2">Williams</persName> had cited. It
                        was, however, foolish to delude ourselves that the Soviets, on their part,
                        do not have some very fine machines; the launching of the Sputniks had
                        clearly proved this. Our previous idea of our innate industrial and
                        technological superiority has been blasted, and properly so. If the United
                        States and the Free World possess a real know-how and a superior technology,
                        we should by all means restrict the export of this know-how or technology to
                        the Soviet bloc. But we must check carefully to be sure that we do possess
                        these advantages. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        also stated that he too did not propose simply adopting the British list of
                        items to be decontrolled. He was, rather, proposing a different approach,
                        and he did not think it very productive to battle to keep every item that we
                        thought should be controlled on the control list.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WW2">Williams</persName> pointed out, in
                        answer to this argument, that the United States had already made concessions
                        to the British with respect to the decontrol of various items. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that while we
                        should constantly keep in mind how we could hurt the Soviet bloc most, we
                        must not forget or overlook how we may in the process hurt ourselves and our
                        alliances.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WW2">Williams</persName> reverted to his list
                        of points, noting thirdly that the proposed reduction of items for control
                        would surely increase the Soviet bloc’s capability for economic penetration
                        of the Free World.</p>
                    <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0740"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WW2">Williams</persName>’ fourth point was a
                        plea that if the urgency of the situation doesn’t actually compel an answer
                        to the United Kingdom right now, could we not postpone a decision on further
                        reduction of the levels of control until the approach of the Summit Meeting
                        or at least of a pre-Summit meeting. If we decontrolled too many items now,
                        we would have nothing to bargain with the Soviet Union at these
                        meetings.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> answered this latter
                        point by indicating that the State Department had given consideration to a
                        delay, but had concluded that the matter could not be handled in this
                        fashion. If postponed much longer, the thing would blow up. The Soviet Union
                        knows very well the attitude and position of most of our allies on the issue
                        of trade controls. Moreover, continued Secretary Dulles, he did not believe
                        in the wisdom of negotiating with the Russians on any basis that we do
                        something injurious to ourselves in order possibly to gain some concessions
                        from the Soviet Union—concessions which might well prove illusory.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then called on Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName>, who stated that he
                        thought that Secretary Dulles’ exposition of the problem had been very
                        persuasive. The most that he would like to add at this time was that the
                        approach of the Department of Defense to these lists of items would be more
                        conservative than the approach of the Department of State. However, when you
                        added it all up, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName>
                        said he did not believe that it would be too difficult to reach a common
                        point of view. Accordingly, the Defense Department did not want to take a
                        violent position on the issue.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it was his
                        guess that we would probably end up in a position somewhere about half-way
                        between the control list desired by the British and the list desired by the
                        United States. While the lists were not susceptible of a mathematical
                        division, we would probably end up roughly mid-way.</p>
                    <p>The President said he was deeply impressed with the variety of considerations
                        which entered into the development of lists for multilateral trade controls.
                        On the other hand, if the Soviets want copper, he couldn’t think of anything
                        that would be better for the United States now than to sell it to them. He
                        had been under very heavy pressure by U.S. copper producers. In general, the
                        President added, he did not believe in these restrictive trade practices
                        except on items whose technology was known to the United States but not
                        known to the Soviet bloc. He would like to see these lists taken up in the
                        negotiations item by item for a careful scrutiny. The President predicted
                        that the Free World would be stronger if we in the United States were more
                        sensible about trade practices. The President cited Japan.</p>
                    <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0741"/>
                    <p>The Japanese desired to manufacture stainless steel. Our manufacturers of
                        stainless steel wanted the President to put on a protective tariff. If he
                        did so, what would the Japanese do?</p>
                    <p>In summing up the discussion of this item, General <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                            >Cutler</persName> said that he would try to write out in general terms
                        the desired policy guidance for the U.S. negotiators. He would submit this
                        proposed policy guidance to the Departments of State, Defense and Commerce
                        before showing the guidance to the President. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then outlined what he believed to be
                        the consensus of the meeting as to the desirable U.S. position in the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested to
                        the President that it would be desirable for the President to ask the <gloss
                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> to review our current U.S. Economic
                        Defense Policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/3) in the light of
                        the changes which were now contemplated in our <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> position with respect to the level of multilateral trade
                        controls against the Sino-Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>The President reiterated that he wanted a scrutiny of the lists item by item.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that this would be
                        done, and that the three Secretaries (State, Defense and Commerce) would
                        agree on which items were to be decontrolled. Such a process, however, would
                        be better accomplished in the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> than in
                        the National Security Council.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that the Central
                        Intelligence Agency ought to be brought into this scrutiny of the items on
                        the lists, because of the immense amount of information on the subject
                        available to that agency.</p>
                    <p>After consulting with Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName>, who sat behind him at the meeting, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that there was
                        very little time to reach agreement on the U.S. position, and he added that
                        he thought the technique of having all three of the Secretaries agree on the
                        items to be decontrolled, before they were presented in the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> negotiations, would not be effective.
                        He believed, therefore, that the decision as to the actual items which we
                        would agree to decontrol should be determined by the Secretary of State in
                        consultation with the Secretaries of Defense and Commerce, together with the
                        advice of the Director of Central Intelligence.</p>

                            as follows: “The Canadian and United States Governments have given
                            consideration to situations where the export policies and laws of the
                            two countries may not be in complete harmony. It has been agreed that in

                        U.S. policy and Canadian policy with respect to trade with Communist China.
                        The Chinese Communists are making apparently attractive offers of trade with
                        Canada, including offers to Canadian subsidiaries of U.S. corporations.
                        Therefore, the President may feel that he will have to relax our existing
                        policy, which prevents trade with Communist China by Canadian subsidiaries
                        of U.S. corporations, and provide licenses for such companies.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> commented that he
                        did not himself see how we could expect U.S. corporations having
                        subsidiaries operating in a foreign country to operate under any other law
                        than the law of the country in which the subsidiary was located.</p>

                    <p>At the present time foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations located in
                        friendly countries are not permitted by U.S. Government regulations
                        administered by the Treasury Department to engage in trade and related
                        transactions with the Sino-Soviet Bloc on the same basis as other firms
                        incorporated in these countries. In addition non-subsidiary foreign
                        corporations which are subject to a degree of control by U. S. private
                        interests, as for instance patent licensees, are also bound by these
                        unilateral U.S. controls. At present the effect of the Treasury regulations
                        is to prohibit all trade by such firms with Communist China. So far as the
                        European Soviet Bloc is concerned, Treasury licensees are required only for
                        the more highly strategic goods and such licenses are considered on a case
                        by case basis. The question is raised as to the appropriateness of these
                        controls in the light of changed circumstances, and specifically whether
                        greater flexibility should be permitted by the Treasury.</p>

                                    have been issued under the Trading With The Enemy Act of 1917,
                                    as amended. The regulations have been put into effect primarily
                                    to support the U.S. embargo policy toward Communist China and
                                    North Korea. In general these regulations prohibit U.S. persons
                                    and firms at home and abroad, as well as foreign agents,
                                    subsidiaries, licensees and others subject to their control,
                                    from engaging in exportation, importation, financing, servicing
                                    or making arrangements for any of these activities, in
                                    connection with trade with Communist China. The form <pb n="721"
                                        xml:id="pg_721" facs="0753"/>of the regulations, however, is
                                    such that no absolute prohibition is stated but rather that
                                    specified transactions are prohibited unless licensed by the
                                    Treasury.</p>
                                <p>The transactions control regulations also require a license for
                                    persons and firms subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. in
                                    order to trade with the European Soviet Bloc in certain
                                    strategic goods (specifically those designated with the symbol
                                    “A” in the Department of Commerce’s published <hi rend="italic"
                                        >Positive Lists</hi>). These “A” items are those that are
                                    agreed internationally for embargo to the entire Soviet Bloc or
                                    for limitation on a quantitative basis. The U.S. as a matter of
                                    policy permits neither category to be shipped to the Soviet Bloc
                                    directly from the U.S. under U.S. export controls. Treasury
                                    controls prohibit foreign firms controlled by U.S. interests
                                    from shipping these items to the Bloc without a Treasury
                                    license. Therefore respecting the controlled items, the U.S.
                                    Treasury controls go beyond the level of control imposed by the
                                    country in which the U.S. subsidiary firm is located. There have
                                    been very few cases in recent years, however, and in practice
                                    the Treasury has been willing to issue licenses if the U.S. has
                                    accepted a <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> action or

                                    China on the same basis as with the European Soviet Bloc
                                    interest in such trade has increased. This interest has centered

                    <p>The embargo character of the <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> regulations
                        as far as Communist China is concerned was determined as a matter of policy
                        during the Korean hostilities. At the time the United Nations branded
                        Communist China as an aggressor many countries joined the U.S. in the
                        fighting in Korea, and therefore gave support to these policies in the trade
                        field. At the present time, however, no important trading country joins the
                        U.S. in the embargo policy and most countries find the U.S. regulations
                        running counter to their policies so far as trade with Communist China is
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> regulations respecting the European
                        Soviet Bloc were introduced at a later date and were designed to help
                        implement the agreed <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> controls and
                        the more stringent U.S. unilateral controls. Inasmuch as the items agreed
                        for embargo control by the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and other
                        countries with which we have mutual aid/Battle <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723"
                            facs="0755"/>Act treaties are already effectively controlled, the
                        Treasury regulations have a potential impact only with respect to the
                        so-called quantitatively controlled items. These items for many years have
                        been licensed to the European Soviet Bloc by all the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> countries except the U.S. In general
                        the Treasury operates its controls toward the European Soviet Bloc so as to
                        parallel Department of Commerce controls over commodities, or to permit U.S.
                        firms to engage in transactions authorized through <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> or through special exceptions procedures. It is difficult
                        to assess the actual impact of the Treasury regulations in the absence of
                        recent cases, but the existence of the regulations probably has some
                        deterrent effect.</p>
                    <p>From the above it is evident that conditions have changed materially with
                        respect to Red China and non-China aspects of the Treasury regulations. In
                        both cases, our friends and allies have passed from an initial period of
                        active cooperation to acquiescence or actual resistance to our off-shore
                        regulations. At the same time the U.S. has had to modify its attitude toward
                        such trade by friendly countries, and at present our position is emerging as
                        a neutral one of not strongly objecting to trade carried on in accordance
                        with the agreed rules.</p>
                    <p>Opposition to the <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> regulations is most
                        pronounced in Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. These countries have for
                        some time been critical of the U.S. embargo policy, but so long as only U.S.
                        trade was involved they could have no basis for objection to our policy.
                        However, following the Paris meetings of the strategic controls committee in
                        the spring of 1957 it was determined by all the participating countries
                        other than the U.S. to reduce the level of controls toward Communist China
                        to that applied to the rest of the Soviet Bloc.<note n="1" xml:id="d331fn1"
                            >In 1957 preliminary figures indicate that Free-world exports to
                            Communist China totalled $511 million and imports were $618 million.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Since that time, therefore, the
                        U.S. controls have served to deny business to firms incorporated in and
                        doing business in these countries—contrary to the trade policies of these
                        countries and to the presumed deteriment of their economies. In other words,
                        U.S. Government actions tend to negate the policies of these countries in a
                        field of trade that they consider normal and desirable. This is particularly
                        the case in Canada, where U.S. financial interest in Canadian corporations
                        is of such great importance.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Canada this subject has direct consequences beyond the trade
                        question. The business recession in Canada has caused labor and business
                        interests to view the Chinese market with perhaps greater hope than the
                        facts justify. In addition the subject has come to occupy a place of some
                        importance in Canadian politics under the general heading of “U.S.
                        interference in Canadian affairs.”</p>
                    <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0756"/>
                    <p>An additional important consideration is the adverse effect of present
                        policies respecting private foreign investment. This aspect was most
                        succinctly stated last fall in a despatch from the U.S. Embassy in Japan as
                        follows: “As a final note, the Embassy wishes to indicate its concern over
                        the possible adverse reaction of the Japanese if a distorted impression is
                        obtained that the United States is attempting to use American investment in
                        Japanese firms to further United States Governmental policies which may not
                        fully coincide with those of the Japanese Government.”</p>
                    <p>In the light of the developments and considerations discussed above it
                        appears desirable to consider whether some degree of flexibility can
                        appropriately be introduced into the foreign aspect of the Treasury
                        regulations. In this connection, the following basic questions must be

                                evaluated in the context of other U.S. commercial policy objectives,
                                particularly that of expanded trade and investment in friendly

                    <p>The Department of Commerce believes that it would be in the national interest
                        for the U.S. to reexamine its position on the question of trade with the
                        Sino-Soviet Bloc by foreign-based U.S. subsidiaries and affiliated firms. In
                        such a review the relative importance of the basic factors involved must be
                        evaluated, particularly the threat to future private investment abroad, the
                        over-all effect on our foreign relations, the economic defense consequences,
                        and the political implications.</p>

                                security controls on trade with the Sino-Soviet Bloc, thereby
                                facilitating accord with our allies and agreement on the maintenance
                                of an effective multilateral security trade control system. The

                                have a clear military application or involve advanced technology of

                                that Defense has no alternative other than to accept the

                            comparison between the new International Embargo List of 120 items and
                            the former list of 182 items is misleading because the magnitude of the
                            reduction is much greater than the mere comparison of numbers would
                            indicate as a result of the adoption of new definitions greatly
                            narrowing the coverage on most items. The complete list with definitions
                            has not yet been received in Washington, but Defense’s preliminary study
                            indicates that the over-all coverage of the former embargo list may have
                            been reduced by as much as 70 to 80 per cent.</p>

                        Battle Act Administrator in making the Battle Act lists identical to the
                        International Lists. Defense filed a statement (Tab C)<note n="4"

                        of the negotiations. This statement alleges that the new International Lists
                        represent a 70–80 percent reduction in previous overall coverage and does
                        not maintain effective control over many items which Defense believes have a

                                extensive than the International Lists would be interpreted by our

                        agreed that the negotiations had been conducted within the above-mentioned

                        at some of the results of the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then called on Mr. Douglas
                        Dillon, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> presented to the Council an oral
                        report covering the background of the negotiations in <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and in the Consultative Group. He
                        pointed out that at about this time last year, when the China and Soviet
                        control lists had been consolidated, we had agreed with our allies to
                        undertake a review of the new combined lists. Work had proceeded all during
                        the following autumn and resulted in a U.S. proposal for a new list
                        containing 148 items which would be subject to control. When we presented
                        this new list to our allies, they had thought that our list was still too
                        broad and inclusive. This was the background for the discussion of the
                        subject which was held in the National Security Council in February 1958,
                        the end product of which was <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No.
                        1865–b quoted above.</p>
                    <p>Negotiations on the technical level lasted from mid-March 1958 to the first
                        of July 1958. The U.S. negotiators started out with our original list of 148
                        items and argued for them as effectively as they could on technical grounds.
                        Subsequently, certain further reductions in the list were agreed upon.
                        Following this, the Consultative Group met in Paris in the middle of last
                        month. The Departments of Defense and Commerce were provided with an
                        opportunity to go over the instructions to the U.S. Delegation prior to
                        these final negotiations. The Defense Department desired us to hold out for
                        certain items which most of our Delegation felt it would be impossible to
                        negotiate successfully without at the same time threatening the
                        effectiveness of <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0764"/>the whole
                        multilateral security trade control system. Defense’s concern centered
                        around four major items: jet fuel, tankers, nickel, and steel rolling mills.
                        We succeeded, in the international negotiations, in retaining jet fuel on
                        the international control list. We also succeeded in maintaining control on
                        nickel to a considerable degree. The problem of the tankers proved very
                        difficult. We agreed to relax the controls on tankers whose speed was less
                        than 18 knots, while keeping control on tankers whose speed was 18 knots or
                        better. The United Kingdom also finally agreed to our keeping steel rolling
                        mills on the list for international control.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired why there had been such controversy about retaining
                        steel rolling mills on the control list. He had not thought that this would
                        be so important, in view of the high degree of efficiency now known to exist
                        in the Soviet steel industry.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that Commerce had
                        thought it extremely important to retain the international controls on the
                        export of steel rolling mills to the Soviet bloc. This was the only aspect
                        of Russian steel production in which the Russians were still behind the
                        United States in progress.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> expressed the view that as
                        a result of the July negotiations the list of military items for
                        international control had actually been somewhat expanded and strengthened.
                        The only item to come off the military list was civilian aircraft, which
                        everybody agreed did not belong on the military list. Certain kinds of
                        civilian aircraft and aircraft weighing over 90,000 pounds were to be
                        continued on the list for control, though on the regular list and not on the
                        military list.</p>
                    <p>The final result of the negotiations in Paris was agreement on an
                        international list of 119 items for multilateral control. The extent of the
                        controls was considerably decreased, although it was the feeling of most of
                        the U.S. Delegation and of the State Department that we now had a solid and
                        reasonable international list.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then read the conclusions
                        of a letter from the Deputy Director, Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                            >CIA</gloss> (Mr. Robert Amory), to himself,<note n="5" xml:id="d334fn5"
                            >See <ref target="#d333fn5">footnote 5, Document 333</ref>.</note>
                        indicating the judgment of the Central Intelligence Agency that the items
                        decontrolled in the new lists would not substantially benefit Soviet
                        military capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> also insisted that items
                        containing advanced technology were safeguarded under the new control list,
                        and that it had been agreed to relax the controls on raw copper because it
                        had been impossible to maintain control over the export of copper wire,
                        which was the really crucial item which we would have liked to maintain
                        controls on. At least, the decontrol of raw copper would be highly pleasing
                        to Chile.</p>
                    <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0765"/>
                    <p>In addition to these main items which had been removed from multilateral
                        control, some 20 new items had been added. These were mostly items which
                        contained very modern technology. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> expressed the general view that the new agreement
                        would stick. All the nations making up the multilateral control system were
                        happy about it, with very few exceptions. However, it had been agreed to
                        review the list annually. The new review will occur in September 1959, when
                        the United Kingdom may again attempt to remove steel rolling mills from the
                        international list.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the language of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action
                        No. 1865–b as it applied to controls on atomic energy items, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that he had not understood the
                        language to mean that we could never change the list of atomic energy items
                        subject to international control, but, rather, that the language meant that
                        we would not decontrol items on the atomic energy list which we agreed were
                        significant. The Atomic Energy Commission is now discussing this matter with
                        representatives of the United Kingdom. There are only two or three items on
                        this list about which there might be a disagreement between ourselves and
                        the United Kingdom. We should have guidance that whatever eventuates from
                        the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> discussions with the United Kingdom
                        should be acceptable to the United States provided the <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> agrees.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Battle Act lists, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said that he, as Battle Act Administrator, had signed
                        a revised list in mid-August which conformed the Battle Act lists to the
                        newly-agreed international lists. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> felt that he had no alternative but to sign such
                        lists, but since this was a matter of major decision, he had not sent
                        forward the new Battle Act lists until he could secure approval in principle
                        again for the precedent set in 1954 of having the Battle Act lists conform
                        to the international lists. He therefore hoped that the National Security
                        Council would note that the Battle Act Administrator had conformed the
                        Battle Act lists to the new international lists. Finally, said Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, a “watch list” was set up in Paris
                        over some 35 items.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had concluded his oral
                        report, the President inquired if there were any questions. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> said that what Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had said was OK with him.
                        He believed that the Department of Defense had been given consideration with
                        respect to its own views. Defense was not altogether happy with some of the
                        decisions made in the international negotiations, but Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> said he realized that decision had
                        to be taken. He would not suggest that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> take any other action than to note the action taken by our
                        negotiators as provided in the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>
                        report.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> noted that
                        representatives of the Department of Commerce had also sat in on these
                        negotiations, and had done the best they could to advance their own views on
                        what items should be <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0766"/>controlled and
                        what items should be decontrolled. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> went on to point out that the emergence of a new
                        international control list made it requisite for Commerce to bring out a new
                        Export Control List. It would be necessary to go over the new international
                        control lists with a view to determining which of the items on the new
                        multilateral control list should be subject to continued U.S. unilateral
                        control and therefore be placed in the new Export Control List. In this
                        regard, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> pointed out
                        that the Russians want to buy from the United States and the West not
                        consumers goods, but heavy industrial equipment. Accordingly, it was his
                        view that the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> should sit down and
                        decide what the United States could do by way of unilateral controls on
                        industrial equipment which the Russians were eager to purchase. He felt that
                        this subject should receive some mention at this meeting.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion, the President asked for further
                        information about the matter of steel rolling mills, where the Russians were
                        clearly behind the United States and the West. Given the fact that the
                        Russians were still unable to buy steel rolling mills from the West, were
                        they not in a position to secure models of Western rolling mills and then
                        copy them for production in the Soviet Union? Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that they would be unable to
                        obtain such plans legally. The President commented that, by and large, he
                        believed that we were often kidding ourselves in imagining that in
                        embargoing or controlling items for export from the West to the Soviet bloc
                        we were securing any concrete advantage. However, he emphatically believed
                        that it was desirable to maintain controls over such items as steel rolling
                        mills, where the Russians were obviously behind the West.</p>

                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets probably genuinely desire an increase in <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            trade. The possibilities for expanding this trade are severely
                            restricted, however, by the limited range of Soviet goods likely to be
                            marketable in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, by <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> administrative and legislative measures
                            in the fields of commercial policy and economic defense, and by the
                            uncertainty of private <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> business
                            reaction. We believe it reasonable to assume that if the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> were to modify certain administrative
                            restrictions, especially export licensing, <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> export to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            might expand over the next few years to about $100-150 million annually.
                            While the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would probably not be
                            able to balance trade at this level by its own direct export of goods to
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, it could make up the residual
                            amount by reexports, transfers of free exchange, and by selling more
                            gold to the Free World. (Paras. 5, 7, 9, 14)</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>An increase in imports from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of
                            the volume and composition postulated in this estimate would have little
                            impact on the Soviet economy. The consumers goods industry could benefit
                            the most if the Soviet leaders so decided; in some cases, however, the
                            imported machinery and equipment could be used to increase the output of
                            commodities for use in more basic industry. Assuming <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> control on the export of strategic goods,
                            we believe the postulated increase in trade would have little effect on
                            Soviet military potential. Soviet trade with underdeveloped countries or
                            Communist China would not be significantly affected. (Paras.
                            15–20)</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The Soviet leaders probably believe that increased trade with the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would strengthen their line of
                            peaceful coexistence, diminish <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ability
                            to maintain Western trade controls and a generally strong <pb n="736"
                                xml:id="pg_736" facs="0768"/>anti-Communist position, and create
                            frictions in the West as various countries found themselves in
                            competition with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> for Soviet trade.
                            We do not believe that these developments would occur to a significant
                            degree. Most non-Communist countries would favorably view an increase in
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> trade as a sign that world tensions were relaxing.
                            This would not be true of South Korea and Nationalist China, however, or
                            among some elements in other countries. Japan, as well as many
                            underdeveloped countries, would become less receptive than they are
                            today to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> advice against expanding
                            economic relations with the Bloc. (Paras. 8, 21)</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>In the final analysis the view taken by most countries would depend
                            largely upon the impact which increased <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> trade had upon the
                            trade of those countries. It is possible that certain countries would be
                            adversely affected by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> competition in
                            the Soviet market or, more probably, by an increase in Soviet raw
                            material exports to the US. We believe that at the postulated levels of
                            trade such effect would in general be small. Nevertheless, substantial
                            increase in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> imports of certain
                            specific commodities from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            might seriously damage the trade or the foreign exchange position of
                            particular Free World countries. (Paras. 21–23)</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> proposed that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would buy non-strategic
                            industrial equipment, especially for the production of synthetic
                            materials and consumer goods, and would sell to the <gloss

                            from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of only $4.5 million. The

                                pre-1941 performance suggests that the fear of a one-shot operation,

                                further on the West. However, it appears likely that the West will

                                would also, as a practical matter, ease the pressure which growing
                                internal development and demands from other Bloc countries have
                                placed on Soviet machinery and equipment industries. Hence, the

                                continue and even grow at a fairly steady pace. Moreover, while the
                                Soviets still adhere basically to a doctrine of self-sufficiency,
                                they have in fact attained this goal in virtually all key sectors of

                                or extent of these advantages. The total value of the imports— $150
                                million—is an insignificant percentage of the total value of Soviet
                                domestic production of machinery and equipment—$25 billion.
                                Moreover, the net gain to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                would be but a small proportion of the $150 million, since the

                                able to use the new equipment either to increase output or to reduce
                                the cost of production at the existing level. The Soviet leaders
                                would also, in some cases, have the option of using the imported

                            might seriously damage the trade or the foreign exchange position of

                            economic effects, could only be judged after study of the particular
                            commodities involved and of the trade patterns which would be
                            disturbed.</item>

                            >Herter</persName></hi>: Because of the serious military situation and
                        the continuing <gloss target="#t_CHICOM1">ChiCom</gloss> build-up in the
                        Formosa Straits area, the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were requested
                        as to whether an attempt should be made to restore at least temporarily the
                        embargo of certain items recently removed from multilateral control to
                        Communist China, and to reimpose a more extensive control of cargo vessels
                        calling at Communist Chinese ports.</p>
                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have now given their views in a Memorandum for the
                        Secretary of Defense, dated September 26, 1958, inclosed herewith, together
                        with a copy of request for their views.<note n="1" xml:id="d336fn1">Both

                        government-to-government contacts suggested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        would appear to be entirely appropriate at this time. It should be noted
                        that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommend the initiation of
                        bilateral negotiations leading to the reimposition of embargo control on

                        the Communist Chinese, and not a reopening of multilateral negotiations for
                        the broad reimposition of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> controls
                        which were drastically reduced in August of this year. It is suggested that
                        the proposed agreement to act in concert with our Allies would be useful,
                        not only as a potential means of interfering with the supply of the
                        Communist military forces, but also as a bargaining point in the current
                        Warsaw discussions.</p>
                    <p>It is sincerely hoped that these suggestions may meet with your approval and
                        that appropriate action may be taken. The Defense Department will be happy
                        to assist you in this matter in any way possible.</p>

                        <item>The controls proposed in the OSD memorandum would, we feel, in no way
                            deter the present level of activity in the Taiwan Strait. The
                            disposition of forces in being and of supplies accumulated through
                            earlier Russian shipments of military equipment are more than sufficient
                            to sustain the present or higher level of activity in this area for some
                            time to come.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>It is of course possible that a high level of Communist Chinese air
                            activity in the Taiwan area might be reduced to some extent in the
                            future by an effective restriction of tanker tonnage available to
                            Communist China. China’s present demand for petroleum fuels apparently
                            exceeds the capability for overland supply from the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; the bottleneck is principally the
                            Chinese rail system. On the other hand, even if seaborne shipments of
                            POL are interdicted, a fairly modest reallocation of existing supplies
                            would permit the support of such limited action as that in the Taiwan
                            Straits.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Because of limited capability of overland supply, any significant
                            increase in present levels of China’s demand for petroleum will require
                            either charter of Western tankers or the deployment of Soviet tankers.
                            Even in this case it should be pointed out that the numbers of tankers
                            required would not be great. For example, the estimated probable
                            movement of 200,000 tons of Soviet petroleum to China by sea in 1958
                            could have been moved in only four Soviet tankers. Of the total of 92
                            ships in the Soviet tanker fleet, 40–50 of them are of the type required
                            for such voyages.</item>

                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>We think it is important to emphasize that the partial embargo of
                            selected strategic goods could be expected to have no significant impact
                            on Communist Chinese military effectiveness. In a controlled economy the
                            size of Communist China’s, particularly when backed by the combined
                            economies of the rest of the Bloc, the inconvenience resulting from
                            selected trade controls such as those proposed could be easily
                            accommodated. The Chinese military build-up depends rather on: (1)
                            Chinese decision to divert domestic economic resources away from other
                            programs to defense, and (2) Russian willingness to augment Chinese
                            resources by [illegible] exports of Soviet strategic supplies.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The Chinese economy although growing rapidly is still relatively
                            underdeveloped by Western standards. Nevertheless, the rate of expansion
                            of Chinese military strength has been considerable in the past few years
                            and may be expected to grow with increased Chinese industrial
                                growth.<note n="2" xml:id="d337fn2"><p>John D. Lacey of the Division
                                    of Research and Analysis for Far East sent Hugh S. Cumming, Jr.,
                                    Director of <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>, a memorandum
                                    which came to a similar conclusion. In his November 7
                                    memorandum, Lacey concluded:</p>
                                <p>“It would thus appear that the imposition of the proposed
                                    controls would have little immediate effect on a Chinese
                                    Communist military build-up. Over the longer run the controls
                                    would to some extent limit the economic choices available to
                                    Peiping, and thereby impose certain costs. These costs would
                                    clearly be very small in relation to Communist China’s total
                                    economic and military effort, but to the extent they existed
                                    they could be considered to reduce Communist China’s industrial
                                    expansion and thereby its long-run military capabilities.”

                            of State, Central Files, 460.509/11–1458)</note> I saw <persName
                            corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> today and raised problem voyage
                        controls. Also delivered memorandum containing substance and most text of
                        first reftel.</p>
                    <p>He began by saying that his personal opinion Anglo-American relations in long
                        run would be best furthered by lack of governmental powers to interfere in
                        private shipping. In that case, incidents arising out of action by shipping
                        companies would not become issue between governments. I pointed out that
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> shipping controls enacted only in 1953
                        and had been preceded by very serious <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        public and congressional reaction against British ships carrying strategic
                        goods to Communist China.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said fundamental political
                        decision had been made to dismantle post-war controls. Cabinet consciously
                        decided in this process to eliminate voyage controls “regardless of
                        consequences”. He also raised question whether the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> concerned with shipping of all countries to Communist China
                        or just <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> shipping. In this connection,
                        FonOff official (Cranston) said all other <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> countries with <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0780"
                        />Merchant fleets have some form voyage controls but have been impatiently
                        awaiting <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> lead in dismantling them. I said
                        that we considered it especially important that <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> have parallel
                        policies. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government would be
                        particularly concerned if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were to
                        appear to be the leader in a movement that could be represented as making it
                        easier for Communist China to obtain strategic items for use against <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in the Taiwan Straits.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> referred to the action taken by
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> last year in eliminating the “China
                        differential” which the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had reluctantly
                        “accepted.” He said that he believed this action and our reaction to it had
                        contributed greatly to improving the state of public opinion in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> concerning <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        Far Eastern policy. He felt that otherwise it would have been impossible for
                        the British Government to take the position they have concerning Quemoy and
                        Matsu. He felt that action had been directly responsible for the British
                        Government’s success in avoiding serious public reaction here to our present
                        position in the Taiwan Straits.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> referred to the British
                        understanding that the bloc has ample shipping for the supply of China and
                        also the fact that, even under the present legislation, there was nothing to
                        prevent their buying British ships for the China trade. But he recognized
                        the psychological point made by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and felt
                        that it would be most unfortunate if British shipping were used on any large
                        scale for the supplying of strategic goods to Communist China. He would be
                        prepared, if necessary, to make his position in this regard clear at
                        appropriate time. Meanwhile, he wished that there were some way to prevent
                        such misuse without requiring a reversal of the fundamental political
                        decision that had already been made by the government.</p>
                    <p>In summing up the position, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>
                        emphasized that he was speaking for himself at this point. Other ministries
                        more concerned with the earnings of shipping companies might feel
                        differently. Therefore, he would have to check his own preliminary ideas
                        with the Cabinet. In the meantime, his position was as follows: (1) <gloss
                            target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would use all its power of persuasion with
                        shipping companies to prevent their carrying strategic goods to Communist
                        China. On inquiry, he explained that he was talking about goods that would
                        require licenses when shipped from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. He
                        also pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government’s
                        power to persuade might not extend to shipping that is under British
                        registry but really not controlled by British businessmen. (2) If there were
                        serious abuse by shipping companies of the termination of formal controls,
                        it would be much easier to obtain favorable action from Parliament on new
                        legislation. Under those circumstances, such legislation would be seriously
                        considered. (3) In the absence of such abuse, he considered it virtually
                        impossible to obtain parliamentary approval of special legislation, at least
                        before the general election.</p>
                    <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0781"/>
                    <p>I said I would report these views to Washington, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he would let me know the results
                        of further discussions in the government.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently, the Embassy was assured by Cranston that the formal
                        announcement would not be made in the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> without further discussions with <gloss target="#t_US1"

                            Ambassador in Washington informed the United States by a note that the

                            licensing and bunkering controls nor further delay notification to

                            the British statement that it regretted this step since it might be
                            subject to “misinterpretation” of Western intentions to stand firm

                    <p>The Chairman advised the members of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy
                        that he had asked the Economic Defense Advisory Council last December to

                        would be useful to talk about what our policy should be in connection with
                        our peaceful trade with Russia. He said that he hoped <pb n="750"
                            xml:id="pg_750" facs="0782"/>that the discussions would be free and open
                        and pointed out that no formal action would be taken by the <gloss

                    <p>He then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> to review for
                        the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> State’s discussions with Mikoyan.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that the Department
                        of State had been unable to find out what Mikoyan wants to discuss. He said
                        that the discussions with Mikoyan to date were mostly political and related
                        to the German problem, and that the question of trade did not come up. State
                        believes that Mikoyan does not want to talk about trade. Nevertheless, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that Mikoyan
                        brought up the matter of trade while in Cleveland.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that two questions are
                        involved in connection with our policy on peaceful trade with Russia and the
                        bloc. First, we must consider just what this trade should consist of and,
                        secondly, we must consider the propaganda advantage that results to either
                        side as a result of the trade.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then reviewed the history
                        of our policy advocating increased peaceful trade with Russia. He said that
                        the President was very clearly in favor of the development of peaceful trade
                        with Russia. The President first called for this at a meeting of the Summit
                        in 1955. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the joint
                        directive of the Summit meeting<note n="2" xml:id="d340fn2">The text of the
                            joint directive, issued at the Geneva Summit on July 23, 1955, is in <hi

                                Documents</hi>, pp. 2015–2016.</note> called for all countries to
                        study measures to eliminate the barriers to trade. He said that the
                        principal interest of the Soviets in trade is the propaganda advantage that
                        they can get out of it. The Soviets look on trade as a balancing out of
                        their economy for the things they need.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then reviewed the recent
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> estimate on trade with the Soviet
                            bloc<note n="3" xml:id="d340fn3"><ref target="#d335">Document
                            335</ref>.</note> which claims that if all controls were removed, our
                        maximum exports would be between $100 and $150 million per year. He then
                        summarized by saying that the Department of State is in favor of increasing
                        peaceful trade with the Soviet bloc but not in favor of conducting such
                        trade through state trading. Also, the State Department is not in favor of
                        granting credits to Russia and, in any event, this is precluded by the
                        Johnson Act. He concluded by saying that he did not believe that trade
                        between the United States and Russia will be very greatly increased in the
                        near future. He said that he looked on trade as an element of the cold war
                        and as more important psychologically than economically.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said that our <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policies call
                        for an expansion of peaceful trade with Russia and that the language in this
                        connection is clear. He said that trade has sharply decreased in the past
                        few years and that he thought this was a result of certain agencies dragging
                        their <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0783"/>feet who are opposed to
                        increasing such trade. He said that our policy has been implemented so as to
                        convey the impression to American business that trade with Russia is a dirty
                        word, bootleg, and disloyal. He said that trade has stagnated and that
                        positive conduct is necessary to implement clear U.S. policy. He concluded
                        by saying that he thought that an increase in this trade would help the
                        cause of peace. At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> said that he did not agree and that was the reason
                        he had requested that our Economic Defense Policy be reviewed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that he was troubled
                        by the items that we and other free countries were sending to Russia. He
                        said that the big problem here was a difference of opinion on what was
                        peaceful trade. He spoke about the shipments of copper wire by <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> nations to Russia requiring
                        Presidential intervention with Mr. Churchill. He said that business is also
                        troubled by the definition of peaceful goods. He believes that the
                        difference of opinion on what is peaceful trade is causing the responsible
                        agencies to take a negative attitude in issuing licenses for trade with
                        Russia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> repeated that there is a
                        vast area of goods that are unquestionably on the peaceful side and that
                        this is the area in which trade has nevertheless fallen.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> said that the question
                        of trade with Russia was brought very strongly to his mind several days
                        after he had taken office as Secretary of Commerce. He said he was asked to
                        approve a license for the shipment of carbon black to Russia. As a result of
                        his experience as a director in the U.S. Rubber Company, he knew that carbon
                        black was used to harden and extend the life of rubber in tires, and that
                        since an army travels on tires in this modern age, it seemed to him that we
                        should not be shipping carbon black to the Russians. He also said that since
                        he had taken office, he has received communications from businessmen who
                        fear that if they sell certain industrial machinery to the Russians, that it
                        will be used to produce goods which will be dumped on world markets in
                        competition with U.S. products. He said he did not know what peaceful trade
                        means when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> says that
                        “Russia has declared war on us.” He added that if we increase trade with
                        Russia, it would seem to him that we would be negating our trade policy with
                        Poland under which we had expended some $200 million to date. In his
                        opinion, Russia should be treated the same as China; namely, the U.S. should
                        embargo all trade with Russia. He concluded by saying that he had two
                        responsibilities: one, as Secretary of Commerce to protect American
                        business; and the other as a private citizen to recognize the State
                        Department in its role as arbiter of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                    <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0784"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SRJ1">Saulnier</persName> said that he was not
                        surprised that the people of the United States are confused as to what is
                        our policy on trade with Russia. He said that if you believe that trade is
                        beneficial to both countries and that Russia’s interests are inimical to our
                        own, it follows in the minds of the people of the United States that trade
                        with Russia is bad and therefore should be precluded. He is disturbed by the
                        perils of peaceful trade with Russia, but believes it is right.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> stated that there
                        certainly should be no confusion in the Government as to what our policy is
                        on this matter, but that nevertheless the interested agencies did not seem
                        to want to carry out the policy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PD1">Paarlberg</persName> said that he was
                        satisfied with the present policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said he was opposed to any
                        relaxation of strategic controls. He said that the Russians act from
                        political motives and that whatever they do, they do for their own
                        advantage. He said that although our policy is for peaceful trade with
                        Russia for ourselves, we want other countries to avoid dependence on trade
                        with Russia. He does not necessarily oppose all peaceful trade with Russia
                        but would like to see a study showing the advantages and disadvantages; and
                        which section of our economy and which goods would benefit from such
                        trade.</p>
                    <p>Dr. FitzGerald advised that no Mutual Security purchases are made behind the
                        Iron Curtain.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> said that the Bureau of the
                        Budget supported the position taken by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName> but they believed the report now in preparation by
                            <gloss target="#t_EDAC1">EDAC</gloss> should indicate clearly as to
                        whether our objectives with respect to increasing peaceful trade with Russia
                        are being met.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bennett</persName> said he was concerned with respect to the
                        recent dumping by Russia of aluminum and tin and he was also concerned about
                        the dumping by the Chinese Communists of textiles in South-east Asia. He
                        thought that this was a very important question that we should take into our
                        consideration in connection with trade with the bloc, but that he realized
                        that this was not necessarily included in our Economic Defense Policy.
                        Otherwise, he could see nothing wrong in what we call peaceful trade, if it
                        did not include dumping.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADH1">Amory</persName> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                            >CIA</gloss> said that if the United States does not trade with Russia,
                        that Russia will trade with Germany or other Western European countries. He
                        said that he did not agree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> that the Russians are engaged in an all out trade
                        war with the United States. He said that statements by Russia in this
                        connection just point up the fact that they are competing with us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> said that the political
                        factors of peaceful trade with Russia are overwhelming and that this would
                        therefore make him support the position of the Chairman. He said he had just
                        returned from India and it was quite evident that the Indians question our
                            <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0785"/>peaceful intentions as a result
                        of some of the things that we are doing. He said that if we indicated that
                        we really intended to increase our peaceful trade with Russia, it would help
                        to alleviate this suspicion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Patterson</persName> of <gloss target="#t_OCDM1">OCDM</gloss>
                        stated that he agreed with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> that we should not do any trading whatsoever with
                        Russia and the bloc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTD1">Morse</persName> said that if we back away
                        from what the President has said with respect to increasing our peaceful
                        trade with Russia, it would indicate that we may be withdrawing from the
                        other commitments that we have made with Russia for cultural exchanges, etc.
                        He said he thought that we ought to try to increase the demand of the
                        Russian citizens for consumer goods. He further indicated that he thought
                        that one of the ways that we could increase our trade with Russia was
                        through agricultural surpluses.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the Department of
                        State favors a study in depth as to whether peaceful trade with Russia is
                        actually helpful to the United States. He said that the Department of State
                        hopes that friendly foreign countries will not become economically dependent
                        on trade with Russia but, on the other hand, State did not object to
                        friendly countries conducting a small amount of trade with Russia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> concluded the meeting by
                        saying that he would see to it that the <gloss target="#t_EDAC1"
                            >EDAC</gloss> review was presented to the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> as soon as possible. He urged members of the Council who
                        had not submitted their recommendations on this matter to <gloss
                            target="#t_EDAC1">EDAC</gloss> to do so immediately. He stated that he
                        would like <gloss target="#t_EDAC1">EDAC</gloss> to make its recommendations
                        to the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> by January 16 and that the

                    <p>In briefing the National Security Council on this agenda item Mr.
                            <persName>Gray</persName> pointed out that the National Security Council
                        action proposed by the Council on Foreign Economic Policy (<gloss
                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>) consisted essentially of applying to
                        other foreign countries the action taken by this Government with respect to
                        Canada on the occasion of the Ottawa meeting in July 1958. That is, to relax
                        our policy with respect to trade with Communist China by subsidiaries of
                        U.S. corporations in friendly foreign countries. These exceptions to the
                        normal prohibition against trade with Communist China by U.S. subsidiaries
                        abroad would be limited, according to the proposed <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> action, to situations (a) which are important to the
                        economy of the friendly foreign country and (b) in which an indigenous
                        company not controlled by the U.S. was unable to fill the order. It was
                        understood that licenses for such trade by U.S. subsidiary corporations
                        would be kept to the minimum.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> also noted that the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff opposed the proposal of the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> on the ground that “it is to the net disadvantage of the
                        U.S., from the viewpoint of its military security to take actions that will
                        ease Communist China’s problems in developing its military capability or
                            potential.”<note n="4" xml:id="d341fn4">The Joint Chiefs made this case
                            in a memorandum to the Secretary of Defense, January 13, which <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> transmitted to the <gloss

                        Following upon this explanation Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                            >Gray</persName> called on the Secretary of State.</p>
                    <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0787"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that in his
                        opinion this issue was primarily of political rather than of economic or
                        military significance. The Communists have developed to a high degree of
                        efficiency the technique of dangling before countries friendly to the U.S.
                        prospects of large orders if only subsidiaries of U.S. corporations in these
                        countries could be compelled to fill orders placed by Communist countries.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then referred to the
                        agreement with Canada on this matter which he and the President had reached
                        during their visit to Ottawa last summer.<note n="5" xml:id="d341fn5">See
                                <ref target="#d330fn2">footnote 2, Document 330</ref>.</note>
                        Despite the relaxation which was then agreed to, in point of fact Communist
                        China has never placed any orders with subsidiaries of U.S. corporations in
                        the Dominion of Canada. In short, the Communist proposals are mere devices
                        to sow discord between the U.S. and its friends. We need not expect that any
                        orders will actually be placed by the Chinese Communists in Canada.
                        Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt it
                        would be wise on the part of the U.S. to relax its policy and thus cut the
                        ground out from under the Communist attempts to cause trouble between the
                        U.S. and friendly foreign countries. Such a move would have no practical
                        implications and what were essentially “phantom orders” by Communist Bloc
                        countries would cease to be the means of creating discord between the U.S.
                        and other friendly countries.</p>
                    <p>The President said he was reminded that another point had come up in the
                        discussion of this problem in Ottawa. The Canadians had been faced with a
                        domestic political problem of being obliged in effect to tell a Canadian
                        subsidiary of a U.S. corporation in Canada that it was not subject to
                        Canadian laws with respect to exports but was in effect subject to U.S. laws
                        on this matter. Obviously this created a very difficult internal problem for
                        the Canadian Government. It certainly appeared to the President to represent
                        an infringement of Canadian sovereignty. The President added his agreement
                        with the view of the Secretary of State that the Communist tactics in this
                        context simply represented a needling device.</p>
                    <p>Secretaries <persName>Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> pointed out that almost immediately after we had
                        agreed at Ottawa last summer to relax our hard and fast rule against trade
                        with Communist China by Canadian subsidiaries of U.S. corporations, the
                        Chinese Communists had withdrawn their orders for flour and for automobiles
                        or had simply not proceeded to send in such orders. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> added that at Treasury’s last
                        meeting with their opposite numbers in Canada, the Canadians had been
                        prepared to come at us pretty harshly with respect to our attitude on
                        trading with the Chinese Communists but we had managed <pb n="756"
                            xml:id="pg_756" facs="0788"/>to give them assurances that we were not
                        discouraging trade with Communist China by Canadian subsidiaries and the
                        Canadians seemed satisfied with our assurances.</p>
                    <p>The President then suggested that the U.S. should enter into a general
                        agreement with Canada so that they would keep us informed of Communist
                        orders for goods produced by Canadian subsidiaries so that we could talk
                        over with them in advance the problems that such orders might present. It
                        seemed to the President that we had been pretty tough in the past in
                        insisting that under no circumstances could Canadian subsidiaries of U.S.
                        corporations fill any orders placed by Communist China.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that the issue
                        with Canada had been amicably settled by a relaxation of our hitherto stern
                        policy against trade with Communist China. What was now before the Council
                        was a proposal that the relaxation we had entered into with respect to trade
                        by Canadian subsidiaries of U.S. corporations be extended to cover such
                        trade by U.S. subsidiaries located in other friendly countries throughout
                        the world. The President said he understood this and pointed out that we
                        should ask any such country to give us a report in advance of completing a
                        deal whereby goods produced by a U.S. subsidiary in that country were
                        shipped to Communist China.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> said that he felt
                        that compliance by the National Security Council with the action proposed by
                        the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> would actually constitute an
                        incentive to U.S. corporations to establish in friendly foreign countries
                        new subsidiaries for the explicit purpose of trading with Communist China.
                        This seemed undesirable to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> who therefore suggested that the Council defer
                        action on the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> proposal pending
                        completion of the forthcoming review of U.S. Economic Defense Policy in
                        general which was now underway in the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>.
                        Apropos Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName>’
                        suggestion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he
                        could see no reason why the U.S. Government could not see to it that no
                        export licenses were granted to U.S. subsidiaries abroad if the subsidiaries
                        had been created for the specific purpose of evading U.S. export controls on
                        trade with Communist China. In reply Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> said he doubted the practicability of the
                        Secretary’s suggestion and called again for his original proposal that the
                        Council table action on the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> suggestion
                        at this time.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that he did not see how this proposal could be tabled at
                        this time. He expressed the view that if the subsidiaries of U.S.
                        corporations in friendly countries were wholly owned by their parent U.S.
                        companies which, he added, was a bad thing in any case, the U.S. Government
                        was certainly in a position to be able to protect itself against evasion of
                        our export controls by newly formed subsidiaries created for the explicit
                        purpose of evading these controls. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> was still skeptical of this possibility and said he
                        doubted <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0789"/>whether this Government
                        would be aware of the export of goods to Communist China by a subsidiary
                        corporation until after the shipment had been made. This view puzzled
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> who inquired whether
                        the subsidiary corporation would not have to apply for and receive a license
                        to ship goods to Communist China. In that case we would certainly know in
                        advance of the shipment if the subsidiary corporation were wholly
                        U.S.-owned. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                        indicated concurrence in this view of the Secretary of State.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> pointed out that
                        the opposition of the Joint Chiefs to the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> proposal was merely a repetition of their well-known view
                        that such an action would constitute another step taken to increase the
                        military and economic strength of the Sino-Soviet Bloc. He also asked the
                        President to suspend judgment for a time as to the wisdom of having
                        subsidiaries of U.S. corporations in friendly countries wholly owned by the
                        U.S. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> said he could
                        not agree with the President’s view that wholly-owned subsidiaries were bad.
                        He thought that, particularly in newly developing countries, wholly-owned
                        subsidiaries could be valuable to these countries. If U.S. ownership was not
                        complete, the profits made by these subsidiary corporations might well be
                        paid out too quickly in dividends. The President replied that he had learned
                        his lesson as a result of having a small holding of Cocoa Cola stock. He
                        said that it had been his experience that when there was local participation
                        in a Cocoa Cola subsidiary abroad, the product sold better and produced
                        greater profits.</p>
                    <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> closed the issue
                        noting that the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> proposal had indicated
                        that the relaxation of the U.S. prohibition would be done on a case by case
                        basis and the Secretary of Commerce’s view that action on the <gloss
                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> proposal nevertheless be postponed
                        pending further study. The President replied that as long as the Secretary
                        of Commerce felt that there was need for further study of this problem
                        before the Council took action, he was agreeable to such postponement.
                        Nevertheless, he stated that as of now, he agreed thoroughly with Secretary
                        Dulles’s views because of his experience with respect to Canada. Perhaps,
                        however, there was no need of hurry in this matter. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> said that he could very well
                        document cases where goods could be shipped to Communist China without
                        obtaining a license. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        added that he could see no particular urgency for Council action on the
                            <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> proposal at this time. If specific
                        cases came up prior to Council action, we could deal with each individual
                        case as it arose.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then stated that it appeared
                        to be the consensus that action on the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>
                        proposal should be deferred.</p>

                        <p>Pursuant to the request contained in your memorandum (Reference 1), the
                            Economic Defense Advisory Committee has taken under consideration
                            current economic defense policy (Reference 2). Only the Department of
                            Commerce has made recommendations for changing current policy.</p>
                        <p>The major Commerce proposal is attached as Tab A. The Commerce memorandum
                            to <gloss target="#t_EDAC1">EDAC</gloss> which explains the reasons for
                            these changes is attached as Tab B.</p>
                        <p>Commerce recommends, in effect, the reversal of the present attitude
                            toward “peaceful trade” and the substitution of economic warfare
                            approach. The concept now contained in our policy provides for
                            interference with trade <hi rend="italic">only</hi> where a clear
                            advantage to the free world would accrue from such interference
                            (Reference 2, paragraph 1). Commerce takes the position that “peaceful
                            trade” with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is incompatible
                            with the current situation brought about by the Berlin crisis and by
                            what Commerce interprets as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            declaration of economic warfare and its dumping of goods in free world
                            markets. Commerce proposes a policy which would deny U.S. exports of
                            strategic or nonstrategic goods to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> unless such exports are individually determined to be
                            to the advantage of the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State considers that the proposals of the Commerce
                            Department would reverse established policy as expressed by the
                            President and by existing policy directives. The Department does not
                            interpret the existing situation as requiring such a reversal of policy.
                            The Department favors a continuation of the present policy on the
                            grounds that it provides desirable flexibility for dealing with the
                            Soviet bloc on trade control questions. The achievement of any effective
                                <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0793"/>impact upon the military
                            and economic capabilities of the Soviet bloc is dependent upon
                            multilateral actions. On the basis of the known attitudes of other
                            cooperating countries, there is little likelihood of obtaining their
                            support for a tightened control policy. Moreover, assuming the maximum
                            level of $150 million annually for U.S. exports to the <gloss

                            the Soviet bloc would not significantly affect the bloc’s ability to
                            continue to engage in economic penetration activities in free world
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense feels that a greater effort should be made to
                            overcome the many shortcomings in the implementation of the present
                            policy, but that beyond that a whole new approach to the problem of our
                            over-all economic posture, vis-à-vis the Soviet bloc, is needed. Defense
                            feels that an impartial study to determine the relative advantages and
                            disadvantages to be derived from a change in policy should be made by
                            qualified experts (preferably an outside of government research
                            organization) before a sound position can be taken. The Commerce
                            proposal, it seems to Defense, underlines the need for such a study.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_EDAC1">EDAC</gloss> generally supports the Defense
                            proposal for a study. State endorsed the proposal with the understanding
                            that current policy would apply pending the completion of the study.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_EDAC1">EDAC</gloss> notes that if economic defense
                            policy is changed as recommended in the Commerce document (Tab A), there
                            would be a need for reviewing several other <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                        <p>It would be necessary for <gloss target="#t_EDAC1">EDAC</gloss> to
                            consider very carefully the new courses of action which would be
                            necessary to implement such revised policy and, further, that it would
                            be necessary to revise and expand the terms of reference of the Advisory
                            Committee on Export Policy and the terms of reference of the Economic
                            Defense Advisory Committee itself because neither Committee has as a

                            designed to provide countermeasures for the penetration efforts of the

                        France. The President inquired whether West Germany would be affected. In
                        reply Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out
                        that the new action would apply only in cases where the subsidiary of an

                                            to bolster the hold the Soviet regimes have over their
                                            people by providing them with increased examples of

                                <item>The Department of Defense strongly supports their proposal for
                                    a study by an outside agency for the following reasons:<note
                                        n="6" xml:id="d344fn6"><p>According to a memorandum from
                                            Cullen to the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>,
                                            March 30, the Department of Defense requested that
                                            paragraph D be changed to read as follows:</p>
                                        <p>“On the basis of available information and current
                                            postures, Defense would support, on a day-to-day basis,
                                            views expressed by the Commerce Department. However,
                                            Defense is anxious to see these and other views
                                            restudied by an outside agency so that there may be an
                                            up-to-date and objective basis for both short-range and
                                            long-range policy. Such a study might point to
                                            tightening of the U.S. attitude toward peaceful trade,
                                            continuation of the present policy, or greater
                                            liberalization of the policy. Defense believes the
                                            following considerations strongly support such a study.”

                                            within the government by qualified people, the work has
                                            been mostly by part time attention and by personnel who
                                            have been very close to the implementation of existing
                                            policies. Therefore, an objective study by newcomers,
                                            expert in the whole field of international trade, based
                                            on long range thinking would serve to either confirm the

                                            desirable changes in policy. In short, such a study
                                            would bring into the determination of policy a new fresh
                                            look of a problem which has been with us for ten

                        <p>With respect to outside firms which might make such a study, there was no
                            agreement in the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> Committee. State
                            felt that it would wish to reconsider its views if a firm other than
                            Rand Corporation was to be concerned. Defense, while not limiting its
                            selection to Rand Corporation, indicated it was satisfied of the
                            competency of that firm. Commerce and Treasury did not express any
                            preference since <pb n="768" xml:id="pg_768" facs="0800"/>basically they
                            are opposed to the study. However, in addition to the Rand Corporation,
                            the names of Battelle Institute, Johns Hopkins, and Stanford Institute
                            were mentioned.</p>
                        <p>On the matter of financing such a study if one is to be made, it was the
                            consensus of the Committee that funds therefor should come from funds
                            available to the President. Additionally, the time element was
                            mentioned. Defense reported Rand had indicated a period of at least
                            three months, but felt that six months would be desirable in order to
                            provide a complete and comprehensive study.</p>

                    <p>I know that you are very much aware of the problems created by recently
                        expressed viewpoints of the Commerce Department on east-west trade.</p>
                    <p>The publicity in the press last week centering around the Senate Committee
                        testimony of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName>
                        emphasizes, in my opinion, the need for coping with these problems at an
                        early date. The Administration has gone on record on several occasions, most
                        recently in your conversation with Mikoyan, and in the President’s reply to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s letter of June 2,
                        1958 on trade,<note n="1" xml:id="d345fn1">Mikoyan and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> discussed possible expansion of

                                1958,</hi> pp. 846–850.</note> as favoring an expansion of peaceful
                        trade with the Soviets. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName>, however, has been quoted as stating that there is
                        no such thing as “peaceful trade” with the Soviets, as favoring the shipment
                        only of consumer goods to the Soviets, as attributing to the Administration
                        planning for an “Economic <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>”, etc.</p>
                    <pb n="769" xml:id="pg_769" facs="0801"/>
                    <p>The various agencies can, of course, be expected to produce different ideas
                        on economic defense during the current review of policy in this field.
                        However, I know that in <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> discussions
                        you have emphasized, and it has been agreed, that during this review period
                        existing policy would continue in effect. The public statements of Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> scarcely seem consistent
                        with this agreement.</p>
                    <p>The press has increasingly begun to pick up evidences of Commerce viewpoints
                        at variance with those of other agencies and of the President. It would be
                        surprising if this were not to lead to further and more searching press
                        inquiries, replying to which would prove quite embarrassing. Questions might
                        well be raised, too, by our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies, in
                        such forums as the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> ECE and <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>. In ECE and <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> meetings our position in favor of
                        expanding peaceful east-west trade has been very useful in gaining the
                        support of our allies in resisting Soviet “propaganda proposals”, e.g., for
                        a World Economic Conference, etc. In such a forum, the Soviets could now
                        cite the public statements of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1"
                            >Strauss</persName> as evidence that the Administration has not been
                        sincere in stating its support for an expansion of peaceful trade, and as
                        indications of a rift between the U.S. and its allies. Such accusations
                        would have their effect, also, on our negotiations with the Soviets on
                        political matters, e.g., at a Foreign Ministers’ meeting, thus generally
                        weakening our posture in the cold war.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that a year ago the
                        National Security Council had asked the Council on Foreign Economic Policy
                        to review U.S. Economic Defense Policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        5704/3). Three months ago the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> noted a
                        report by the Council on Foreign Economic Policy that the policy should be
                        continued pending <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> study of its
                        implementation. The <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> study has now been
                        completed and a further report from the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> is before the Council. The Joint Chiefs of Staff in their
                        comments on the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> Report have
                        re-affirmed their interest in effective trade controls against the
                        Sino-Soviet Bloc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> said that at the request
                        of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> had reviewed U.S. Economic Defense Policy and had arrived
                        at the conclusion that it would submit no recommendation for changes in that
                        policy at this time. There were, of course, differences of opinion among the
                        agencies represented on the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> as to our
                        policy on trade with the Soviet Bloc. Existing policy was based upon “the
                        assumption that interference in the trade between the Free World and the
                        Sino-Soviet Bloc should take place only where a clear advantage to the Free
                        World would accrue from such interference,” (par. 1 of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/3). A recent letter from the President
                        to Khrushchev had stated that the U.S. favored the expansion of peaceful
                        trade with the U.S.S.R.<note n="6" xml:id="d346fn6">See <ref

                        reviewed by a <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> committee which had
                        submitted an exhaustive report to the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss>.<note n="7" xml:id="d346fn7">A summary of the report is

                            >CFEP</gloss> had concluded that the implementation of economic defense
                        policy was satisfactory and that no changes in such policy were needed. This
                        conclusion by the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> represented a middle
                        course between the shades of opinion among the various agencies. In
                        conclusion Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> noted that any
                        department could propose a change in U.S. Economic Defense Policy and that
                        if any change were proposed, the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> would
                        again review the policy. Assistant Secretary of Commerce <persName
                            corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> said he endorsed the comments made
                        by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> and had nothing to
                        add. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> remarked that the
                        question of review of U.S. Economic Defense Policy would continue to come up
                        annually.</p>

                    <p>The Under Secretary referred to the British proposals for <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> which had been transmitted to the
                        Department on September 8th.<note n="1" xml:id="d347fn1">The British draft
                            proposals are described below.</note> He said that the proposals were
                        described as being the product of the official working level within the
                        British Government, not as yet reviewed or approved by British Ministers. He
                        said that of course the United States had not made a detailed technical
                        analysis of the British proposals, but did have some initial views.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that the cumulative effect of the British proposals
                        was so extensive as not to be in accord with the spirit of the general
                        understanding which prevailed at the time of the 1958 Consultative Group
                        meeting to the effect that the annual list review would involve only minor
                        adjustments in the international lists necessitated by significant changes
                        in technology or Soviet bloc utilization during the year. He said that the
                        prevailing view had clearly been that the 1958 list review represented a
                        major revision and reshaping of the international control system for a
                        long-term period, at least several years. The previous general list review
                        had taken place in 1954 and it was the view of the participating governments
                        that the 1958 review would remove the necessity for any major revision of
                        the lists for approximately a similar period of time. He said that of course
                        it was understood that any participating country might make a special
                        proposal on a particular item at any time as, for example, the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had done with respect to rolling mills.</p>
                    <p>The British proposed changes, contrary to the view that the 1959 review
                        should be a minor overhaul operation, would affect half of the present
                        embargo list. The list contains 120 items at present and the British
                        proposals would contemplate removing 26 items plus an additional six
                        sub-items, would propose redefinitions for an additional 12 items, and might
                        involve some potential changes in an additional 16 items which are still
                        under study within the British Government. Changes of this magnitude would
                        necessitate a major negotiation in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                        on the scale which was necessary last year, especially when the suggested
                        changes of other participating governments were added to the changes
                        suggested by the British. One of the most disappointing aspects of the
                        British proposals was the fact that they proposed the deletion of all the
                        items which had been the subject of special compromise efforts in 1958. This
                        honestly seemed to us not to be in the real spirit of the 1958 agreement.
                        The Under Secretary said he hoped the British Ministers would consider this
                        U.S. reaction most seriously.</p>
                    <p>He said that the British proposals left us in a difficult situation. A major
                        negotiation would require the assignment of large numbers of technicians and
                        lengthy discussions in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> which would
                        unquestionably <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0805"/>extend for many
                        months. This negotiating process could not possibly be completed within the
                        schedule set by the Consultative Group. Instead of a January 1 effective
                        date for the revised lists, a June 30 date would be more realistic. Apart
                        from the extended time involved for such negotiation, the worst part of the
                        situation is that it would inevitably involve a sharp and unedifying debate
                        between the United States and the United Kingdom in the multilateral forum
                        before the other participating governments. Such an exhibition could not
                        help but be damaging to the interest of both the United States and the
                        United Kingdom in maintaining a cooperative atmosphere within the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> community. Any such flare-up of basic differences on
                        East-West trade control questions would be particularly unfortunate at this
                        time since such good progress has been made in recent months in resolving
                        the various economic problems which have troubled <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>–UK relations.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that he felt there might be a better way out of the
                        difficult situation which we would face if the British proposals were tabled
                        as they stand in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>, and that he wished
                        to outline his views on this matter for consideration by the British
                        Ministers when they go over the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        official-level proposals. He said that it might be possible for the British
                        to select a few items which were of special importance to them either for
                        trade reasons or for political reasons or because of other considerations of
                        urgency, and propose changes on those items in the forthcoming annual list
                        review. If the British were to select six or eight or, at most, ten of such
                        items for discussion in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>, this would
                        represent a manageable task for the Committee and would be quite acceptable
                        to the United States in terms of a feasible working program. The remaining
                        items in the British proposals could then be made the subject of bilateral
                        technical discussions between the United States and the United Kingdom,
                        beginning at such time as the 1959 annual <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> review has been completed. The purpose of such bilateral
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        discussions should be to discover whether a substantial agreement might be
                        reached between the two countries on the remaining British proposals. If
                        such agreement could be reached, the United States would then have no
                        objection to British submission of such proposals to <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> at any time following the 1959 list
                        review or at the latest at the time of the 1960 list review. This
                        arrangement would have the advantage of permitting the British to deal with
                        a few items which are of importance to them and on which changes might be
                        justified in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and would be in
                        accordance with the prevailing concept of a limited annual list review. In
                        addition, it would remove the danger of an unrewarding semi-public debate
                        between the United States and the United Kingdom and would permit an orderly
                        bilateral examination of the British <pb n="774" xml:id="pg_774" facs="0806"
                        />proposals on their merits. As a practical matter, the British would not
                        really lose any time as compared with a major review which would extend well
                        into next year in any event.</p>
                    <p>Lord Hood said that he was not familiar with the details of the items dealt
                        with in the British proposals but inquired whether the Under Secretary had
                        in mind that the British might make the selection of items for discussion in
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> in the 1959 review themselves or
                        whether he had in mind that such selections would be a joint matter with the
                        United States. The Under Secretary said that he had in mind that the British
                        would make the selection themselves taking account of their own special
                        interests. Lord Hood said that he had little idea of what items might be of
                        special importance, but he did recall that he had heard considerable
                        reference made to the importance of aircraft. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that the British proposal with
                        respect to aircraft did not appear to be a troublesome one to deal with in
                        the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> discussions. He said the British
                        proposal was essentially for a clarification and extension of embargo
                        coverage for aircraft engines to bring this treatment into conformity with
                        the treatment of aircraft themselves, and seemed to be an appropriate
                        suggestion. He noted also that the British had made proposals for the
                        liberalization of certain instrument systems and navigation radar systems
                        for aircraft to make such equipment freely available for export to the
                        Soviet bloc for use on scheduled services to the free world. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that this might be another
                        point of special interest to the British. It was a liberalization somewhat
                        beyond our present policy on such sales but might be a reasonable question
                        to re-examine.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that while there might be some items such as those
                        which had been mentioned which were of significance to the British and which
                        might profitably be re-examined, he felt that there certainly appeared to be
                        many items in the British list to which the British themselves might wish to
                        give some careful second thoughts. For example, he said that the proposal to
                        delete fishing vessels designed for speeds of 17 knots and over was a type
                        of proposal which seemed to be highly doubtful. It was clear that nobody
                        would build a fishing vessel of that speed unless it was actually intended
                        for naval applications. While the United Kingdom and the United States might
                        not wish to build or sell such vessels to the bloc, the removal of the item
                        from the international list would make it possible for other <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> countries to take advantage of such
                        trade, and the Japanese, for example, might be most interested in building
                        substantial quantities of fishing vessels for sale to the Communist Chinese
                        where they would in fact constitute a significant military potential
                        item.</p>

                    <p>The British Chargé said that he would report the U.S. reactions and proposal
                        to London for consideration there and indicated that he saw some merit to
                        the proposal which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had
                        outlined.</p>

                                other governments to postpone consideration of the items in view of
                                these special circumstances. He said this was very much a Cabinet

                    <p>As Hood told <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> September 22, upon
                        Lloyd’s return to London the Foreign Secretary found it impractical to
                        postpone the whole <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> review, but the
                        British Government agreed that “further large-scale public disagreement
                        between the U.S. and U.K.” should be avoided. Hood stated that the British
                        Government would like to suggest a total of 12 or 13 items for consideration
                        rather than the 10 which the U.S. Government had suggested. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed with that proposal as a
                        “reasonable number.” Hood said that the British hoped that 8 of these items
                        could be agreed upon in the ensuing review and the remaining items could be
                        the subject of bilateral discussions early in 1960 after the completion of
                        the present <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> review. (Memorandum of

                    <p>The annual review of trade restrictions toward the Sino-Soviet bloc by the
                        15-nation Coordinating Committee (<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>)
                        in Paris began on October 30. These consultations were expected to make
                        minor adjustments which better reflected changes in technology in the
                        Sino-Soviet bloc and to clarify some of the definitions of the 120 strategic
                        items over which the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> countries
                        exercised export control. During the course of the review, five items were
                        deleted from the embargo list and five items, proposed by the U.S.
                        Delegation, were added to the list as well as one item to the surveillance
                        list. Forty-four items raised for discussion were either redefined or left
                        unchanged after technical examination.</p>
                    <p>There were, however, five items in the field of electronics for which no
                        agreement could be reached. Two of these—radio transmitters and
                        communications, navigation, and radar equipment—were of particular interest
                        to the United Kingdom. While the United States was unprepared to remove
                        these two items from the list, it did tentatively agree to redefining
                        portions of their definitions. The three remaining items—radio
                        communications equipment, line communications equipment, and communication
                        cable—were considered by the United States to be of great strategic value to
                        the Soviet bloc because of their application for peripheral early warning
                        air defense and ground controlled interception systems. The United States
                        believed the Soviet bloc, deficient in this technology, was engaged in a
                        campaign to obtain it from the West.</p>
                    <p>Among the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> countries other than the
                        United States there was widespread support for a proposal to export the
                        three items as long as they would be put to nonstrategic use. The other
                        participants at Paris suggested a plan whereby <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> would be notified of the exportation of the items on an
                        ex post facto basis. The United States opposed this proposal on the grounds
                        that it would be interpreted so loosely that there would be little
                        meaningful control over the equipment. The U.S. Delegation proposed
                        consultation prior to exportation of the three items and, if the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> members agreed that the exports met the
                        criteria for nonstrategic use, then the items could be shipped to the Soviet
                        bloc. Other participants at Paris opposed the U.S. suggestion on the grounds
                        that the United States would object to most requests for exportation of
                        these three items of electronic equipment.</p>
                    <p>In view of this basic disagreement, the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> members agreed to postpone the enactment date of the 1959
                        list from January 1 to February 1, 1960. In the interval, there was some
                        expectation that a compromise could be worked out. The United States used
                        this interval to strengthen its position among certain <gloss

                            xml:id="pg_777" facs="0809"/>the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada. As a
                        result, the discussion at Paris failed to resolve the impasse. Although the
                        United States was prepared to relax controls on the two items of particular
                        interest to the United Kingdom, the French Delegation insisted on a
                        settlement on the three remaining items as the price for its acceptance of
                        the compromise on the first two. The United States was unprepared to accept
                        the French conditions. Because <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                        procedures required unanimous agreement to change existing definitions, all

                            “from a military viewpoint, stringent restrictions on export trade of
                            strategic materials with nations of the Sino-Soviet Bloc are a means of
                            retarding the growth of the Bloc’s war making potential.” In view of the
                            “increased world tensions since the breakup of the Summit Conference,”
                            the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommended tightening controls
                            on trade with the Sino-Soviet bloc. (<hi rend="italic"

                        Briefing Note is filed in the Minutes of the Meeting and another is attached

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> said this subject was
                        a rather old one. The Department of Defense believed that the Soviet Bloc
                        war-making potential was enhanced by trade with the Soviet Union. In the
                        past the U.S. had had difficulty in maintaining the firmness of its allies
                        in this field. Defense had always advocated stronger restrictions on trade
                        with the Soviet Bloc. He believed we should have a controlled strategic list
                        and would like to see our controls tightened. He understood that the
                        Chairman-designate of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>, an Italian,
                        believes that there is now an opportunity to add items to the strategic
                        list.</p>
                    <p>General Twining said the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in addition to endorsing the
                        comments of the Secretary of Defense, felt that the present policy had been
                        approved at a time when the international situation was more peaceful and
                        less tense than it is now.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> pointed out that it
                        was his responsibility to approve or disapprove licenses for the shipment of
                        commodities to the Soviet Bloc. He said that in addition to the <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list on which our allies are agreed,
                        there is a U.S. “positive list” of eighty items which the U.S. is not
                        exporting to the Soviet Bloc. Of course it could be argued that any export,
                        for instance sheet steel, a great deal of which we were now sending to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, relieves the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of the requirement of making that
                        commodity and therefore inures to the strategic benefit of the Soviet Union.
                        However, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> was more
                        worried about sales by U.S. nationals of industrial processes to the
                        Soviets, whether such processes are strategic or not. Under present law and
                        policy it is permissible for industrial processes to be sold to the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, thus enabling the latter’s industrial
                        development to proceed by leaps and bounds which eliminate some of the long
                        research and development activities necessary to the development of finished
                        industrial processes.</p>
                    <p>The President believed that international trade was something like a horse
                        trade. The question was, do we get greater benefits than the other side from
                        the trade? He added that we were quite concerned by the outflow of gold,
                        which might almost be classed as a strategic materiel. The President would
                        be willing to ship almost any commodity to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> if we could receive gold in return, since gold was an
                        important element in our economic strength. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> said we could not require U.S.
                        nationals to receive gold in return for shipments to Russia. The President
                        said it might be desirable to make a <pb n="779" xml:id="pg_779" facs="0811"
                        />policy requiring the payment in gold for our exports to the Soviet Union.
                        If objections to such a policy were voiced before the Supreme Court, we had
                        an Attorney General to argue the case for us.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said we had
                        experienced difficulties with our allies on the question of restricting
                        exports to the Soviet Union. An agreement had been reached two years ago and
                        the situation had been quiescent since then. An agreed list of items fully
                        covers commodities which have direct strategic value. The view had been that
                        trade in general industrial items should not be eliminated. The agreed list
                        is reviewed each year. The first review took place last year and the second
                        review is due to begin in a week or so. State and Defense are in agreement
                        on the deletion of four items from the agreed list and the possible deletion
                        of several more. There is also agreement that increased coverage should be
                        sought for 23 items. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        felt that in the present situation we ought to look coldly and with a great
                        deal of skepticism at any suggestion that items be deleted from the list of
                        commodities which cannot be exported to the Soviet Bloc.</p>
                    <p>The President said the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views spoke of the
                        implementation of economic defense controls being liberalized, rather than
                        of adding or deleting items on the list. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said implementation of U.S. Economic
                        Defense Policy was good with respect to any item on the list. Therefore the
                        question, he thought, was one of what items should be on the list.</p>
                    <p>The President asked why it was not desirable for the Department of Commerce,
                        in considering applications for export licenses, to find out what kind of
                        payment would be made for the export. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said a great many of the transactions which the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> attempted to arrange were barter
                        transactions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName>
                        agreed, adding that businessmen were constantly thinking up deals with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and presenting them to the
                        Department of Commerce, which generally turned them down. Each case arising
                        under economic defense policy is presented to the inter-agency group working
                        on this problem. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName>
                        noted that the Defense representative on this group usually voted against
                        permitting trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> said that multilateral as
                        well as bilateral trade was often involved. The President asked whether this
                        kind of problem could be processed through the National Advisory Council.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that a complex
                        inter-agency organization existed for the purpose of dealing with this
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> believed that two types of
                        controls were often confused—the multilateral controls of <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and the U.S. unilateral controls. He
                        asked whether the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> were suggesting that
                        the U.S. initiate an entire new review of the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss> controls. He believed such an undertaking would be
                        hazardous. He had discussed this problem with Ambassador Burgess during his
                        recent trip and had been told <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0812"/>that
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be perturbed by a review of
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> controls aside from the
                        continuing review which constantly takes place in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                            >COCOM</gloss>. With respect to U.S. unilateral controls, the President
                        had established the general policy line when he said that the United States
                        favors trade. The Department of Commerce was constantly attempting to
                        increase our exports. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>
                        pointed out that exports to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        counted in the balance of payments the same way as exports to any other
                        country. The President agreed but said he did not want soft currencies in
                        exchange for our exports.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> said the Russians were
                        shrewd traders whose credit was good. There was no need to worry about the
                        soundness of the method of payment they used in making settlements for their
                        imports. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said one
                        exception to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>’s
                        observation might be the barter deals which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> worked out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName> believed it was in the overall interest of the U.S.
                        not to limit trade in general. No commodity was involved which the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could not produce itself or buy from our
                        allies. We had consented in advance to the sale of these commodities by our
                        allies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> said there was
                        wonderment in the business community at the idea that we should prevent the
                        shipment of a commodity to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> while
                        permitting our allies to ship it. In conclusion, he thought existing U.S.
                        Policy on Economic Defense (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/3)
                        should stand as written. The President agreed. The President then remarked
                        that the Soviet record on lend lease was not a good one. He added that in
                        his view peaceful trade was desirable.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> believed it was not
                        in the national interest for our industrial processes and industrial secrets
                        to be sold to the Soviet Bloc. He thought the acquisition of these processes
                        improved the military potential of the Soviet Bloc. In response to a
                        question from the President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1"
                            >Mueller</persName> said that under present rules the selling of
                        industrial processes to the Soviet Bloc could not be halted. The process for
                        making thermopane windows was a case in point. The Soviets could develop
                        this process in time but they would require a long time. The President asked
                        why the selling of industrial processes could not be stopped. He wondered
                        whether industrial processes could not be declared strategic. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> agreed that an industrial
                        process could be declared strategic.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> concurred in the
                        remarks of the Secretary of Commerce. He said that ten to twelve years ago
                        when someone invented a new industrial process, ten years were required
                        before the process began to be used abroad. Now, however, a new industrial
                        process comes into use abroad in about two years. We encourage private
                        companies to engage in extensive research with the result that <pb n="781"
                            xml:id="pg_781" facs="0813"/>new processes developed by this research
                        are exported and are soon producing goods which come back into the U.S. at a
                        lower price than they can be produced here.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that one problem
                        faced by Commerce was that an industrial process which the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wanted has often been sold already to our
                        allies, so that if we do not allow the sale to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, the latter can obtain the process from our allies.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> said it was
                        sometimes claimed that a process could be obtained from our allies when in
                        fact the process obtained was not as effective as our own process.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that U.S. Economic
                        Defense Policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/3) provided in
                        Paragraph 11 that we should “maintain toward the European Soviet Bloc U.S.
                        export controls over multilaterally-agreed items and over much materials,
                        equipment, technology, and services as can be so unilaterally controlled by
                        the U.S. as to achieve a worthwhile adverse impact on the war potential of
                        the European Soviet Bloc or can effectively serve other U.S. policy
                        objectives ... “<note n="6" xml:id="d350fn6">Ellipsis in the source
                            text.</note></p>
                    <p>The President said he believed he could apply that policy to prohibit the
                        sale of U.S. industrial processes to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>. He pointed out that the word “technology” appeared in the
                        paragraph Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> had just read.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> said that
                        unilateral controls had been developed under this paragraph. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> believed the key to the
                        problem was what the U.S. itself could effectively control. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> believed that the thermopane process
                        mentioned by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> could
                        be controlled by the U.S. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1"
                            >Mueller</persName> said the policy was one of peaceful trade. The
                        President said trade was actually decreased by making our industrial
                        processes available to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> hoped the Council
                        would realize he was not in favor of trade with the Russians; in fact, he
                        would like to cut off all trade with them. The President said he favored
                        trade whenever the U.S. secured an advantage from such trade.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> believed that the policy
                        statements in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/3 would enable us to
                        control the export of industrial processes. He then noted that no one seemed
                        to be recommending a change in U.S. Economic Defense Policy. He suggested
                        the Record of Action show agreement that the policy did not require change
                        at this time but that the interested departments and agencies should keep
                        the implementation of the policy under constant scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that Cuba would soon be needing
                        certain U.S. industrial processes in order to keep its oil industry going.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> said that in theory
                        Cuba was still a friendly country and that we were not prohibiting general
                        trade with Cuba. However, he had prohibited the export of certain items such
                        as jeeps and crop-dusting <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782" facs="0814"
                        />airplanes. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said
                        our only recourse at present was to appeal to exporters not to export to
                        Cuba. The President wondered why it would not be possible to delay clearance
                        of ships or planes bound for Cuba. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said that Cuba might need a chrome valve for its
                        oil industry because of the use of corrosive Russian oil. Under present
                        rules there was no way of preventing shipment of this valve to Cuba. The
                        President said he would be inclined to delay the sailing of the ships
                        carrying this valve for about four weeks. He felt this government had so
                        many resources that we should not say we are helpless in the face of this
                        kind of situation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName>
                        said that he could stop trade with Cuba but we would have to make a public
                        statement of our position. Moreover, the President could declare Cuba a
                        Communist country, in which case commodities denied the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would also be denied Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> questioned whether it
                        was necessary to initiate a whole new study of the implementation of U.S.
                        Economic Defense Policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said
                        he had not meant to suggest that a new and separate study was required but
                        was only recommending that the present inter-agency group keep the
                        implementation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5704/3 under constant
                        study. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out
                        that it had been suggested that the Rand Corporation make such a study; he
                        did not believe this would be a desirable step. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said the operating agencies could
                        arrange for whatever studies they desired. He felt no new mechanism for a
                        study should be created.</p>

                            5704/3) be continued without change at this time; but agreed that the

                            by all interested departments and agencies to ensure that it serves the
