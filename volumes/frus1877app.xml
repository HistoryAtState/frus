                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Under the provisions of section 208, Revised
                        Statutes, and of paragraphs 380, 381, and 382 of the Consular Regulations,
                        the representatives of the United States in foreign countries are instructed
                        to transmit to the Department such commercial information and statistics as
                        they respectively obtain, in order to enable the Secretary of State to
                        prepare the annual reports upon the “Commercial Relations of the United
                        States,” which the laws authorize him to make.</p>
                    <p>Besides the general information thus to be compiled there is another and more
                        specific line of inquiry to which the Department now desires to invite your
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the period has now arrived when it would be wise for all
                        the nations of this continent to consider more carefully than heretofore how
                        they may best enlarge their trade with each other. Their geographical
                        position and the resemblance between their political institutions facilitate
                        the cultivation of such commerce. The United States are in a condition to
                        supply cheaply and easily many products and manufactured articles, suitable
                        to their wants, to all or nearly all of the Spanish American republics, as
                        well as the Empire of Brazil, receiving in return natural products, which
                        can be utilized here. A favorable opportunity for the development of such
                        trade would seem to be now offered by the prevailing stagnation of business
                        and depression of prices. It is desirable, of course, for the United States
                        that they should find markets for the export of their products and
                        manufactures, and, on the other hand, it is advantageous to the people of
                        those countries they should be able to purchase at the present decreased
                        valuation.</p>
                    <p>Apart from questions of merely commercial or pecuniary advantage, the
                        development of such trade would have also a beneficial influence upon the
                        political condition of the republics of this continent. It is for the
                        interest both of North and South America that all those republican
                        governments should have stability, peace, law, and order. It is not
                        unreasonable to believe that when the popular energy now wasted upon schemes
                        of revolution or military aggrandizement shall have been turned toward more
                        peaceful and profitable enterprises, the republican form of government in
                        each and all of those countries will thereby be strengthened, and more
                        harmonious relations will prevail between them.</p>
                    <p>In view of these considerations, it is desired by the Department that its
                        diplomatic and consular officers should devote attention to the question of
                        methods by which trade with the United States can be most judiciously
                        fostered. Without seeking to interfere with any commercial operations or
                        enterprises that may now be in existence, it is nevertheless deemed highly
                        probable that you may be able, by examination and inquiry, to point out
                        branches of trade with ———, in which the <pb facs="0736" n="2" xml:id="pg_2"
                        /> United States may properly and usefully share. You are instructed,
                        therefore, to make such examination at your convenience and to advise the
                        Department, when suitable occasions shall offer, as to the demand for
                        different kinds of manufactured articles now used in —— —, their nature and
                        prices, and whether they are of the character which it is probable the
                        industry of the United States can supply. Also as to the products of —— —,
                        in which the trade with the United States could be increased, either by
                        legislation, or executive action, or by commercial enterprise.</p>
                    <p>The inquiry here suggested should not be hastily made, nor is it expected
                        that it will be rapidly accomplished. It is rather the purpose of the
                        Department that it should be continuous, and that you may from time to time
                        communicate to the government such information as you may from time to time
                        acquire in this direction in order that it may be laid before Congress and
                        the general public.</p>

                    <p>It is believed that the period has now arrived when it would be wise for the
                        nations, not only of this continent, but also of Europe, to consider more
                        carefully than heretofore how they may best enlarge their trade with this
                        country. The United States are in a condition to supply cheaply and easily
                        many products and manufactured articles suitable to the wants of different
                        countries, receiving in return natural products and articles of manufacture
                        which can be utilized and consumed here. A favorable opportunity for the
                        development of such trade would seem to be now offered by the prevailing
                        stagnation of business and depression of prices. It is desirable, of course,
                        for the United States that they should find markets for the export of their
                        products and manufactures; and, on the other hand, it is advantageous to the
                        people of other countries that they should be able to purchase at the
                        present decreased valuation.</p>
                    <p>In view of these considerations, it is desired by the Department that its
                        diplomatic and consular officers should devote attention to the question of
                        methods by which trade with the United States can be most judiciously
                        fostered. Without seeking to interfere with any commercial operations or
                        enterprises that may now be in existence, it is, nevertheless, deemed highly
                        probable that you may be able, by examination <pb facs="0737" n="3"
                            xml:id="pg_3"/> and inquiry, to point out branches of trade with—— —, in
                        which the United States may properly and usefully share. You are instructed,
                        therefore, to make such examination at your convenience, and to advise the
                        Department, when suitable occasion shall offer, as to the demand for
                        different products and manufactured articles now used in ———, their nature
                        and prices, whenever they are such as it is probable the industry of the
                        United States can supply. Also, as to the products of——, in which the trade
                        with the United States could be increased, either by legislation, or
                        executive action, or by commercial enterprise.</p>
                    <p>The inquiry here suggested should not be hastily made, nor is it expected
                        that it will be rapidly accomplished. It is rather the purpose of the
                        Department that it should be continuous, and that you should from time to
                        time communicate to the government such information as it may be in your
                        power to acquire in this direction, in order that it may be laid before
                        Congress and the general public.</p>
                    <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 196, of September 13,
                            1877, I acknowledged the receipt of the circular (separate) of the Hon.
                            William M. Evarts, Secretary of State, on the subject of the trade of
                            the United States with South American countries, and soliciting
                            suggestions from consular officers in regard to methods by which it may
                            be developed and increased.</p>
                        <p>I have incidentally given some attention to the subject so far as it
                            extends to the Argentine Republic, and I shall shortly make a report to
                            the Department in reference thereto; but I write at present to say that
                            the substance of the circular has already been approvingly noticed here
                            by a number of the newspapers. As showing the view which is taken of it,
                            I inclose you a slip which I take from the Herald of this city, which
                            refers somewhat at length to the commerce of the United States with the
                            River Plate, and quotes from my last commercial report in regard to some
                            of the obstacles in the way of its extension.</p>
                        <p>I would add that the Argentine chargé d’affaires in the United States
                            also writes from New York, under date of July 25, 1877, in hearty
                            approval of Mr. Secretary Evarts’s circular, and asking the co-operation
                            of the Argentine Government in the suggestions; at the same time asking
                            Dr. Irogoyen, the Argentine minister of foreign affairs, to furnish the
                            representatives of the United States with all necessary information on
                            the subject.</p>

                            <p rend="center">COMMERCE WITH THE UNITED STATES.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States and its mercantile community are
                                directing attention toward the South American countries, especially
                                Brazil and the River Plate. A few days since the Herald published
                                the substance of a circular note addressed to the diplomatic and
                                consular officers in these countries by the Secretary of State, Mr.
                                Evarts, which has already been received at the various American
                                legations and consulates. This is indicative of an important
                                movement, which should receive prompt recognition and co-coperation
                                at our hands, both as a business community and a government. We are
                                aware that the action of the latter is of necessity circumscribed
                                and held within narrow limits in the matter of fostering trade; and
                                we do not believe it sound in principle or good in results to relax
                                these restrictions; but it is proper <pb facs="0740" n="6"
                                    xml:id="pg_6"/> that commerce should be left as much as possible
                                to itself, having free course and few hinderances; and so, in our
                                relations with the United States, we should cordially meet the
                                awakening interest shown by that people in a careful review of the
                                taxes placed on commerce in the way of duties.</p>
                            <p>That there is reason for such a suggestion may be seen when it is
                                known that the United States consul in our own city, of whom it is
                                simple justice to say that nowhere can be found a more painstaking,
                                capable, and efficient consular representative of the United States,
                                declares in his report, as published in the “Commercial Relations of
                                the United States for 1876,” that this country has a tariff of
                                duties which discriminates against importations of the United States
                                or against articles which it would import. Consul Baker, in this
                                report to his government, says:</p>
                            <p>“There is no doubt that the discrimination which the Argentine
                                customs-tariff in its tables of valuation has made against the
                                manufactures of the United States and in favor of other countries
                                has had much to do in preventing the introduction of our staples.
                                Because of the superiority of our cotton fabrics, they have a higher
                                valuation placed upon them in, the custom-house, and by that much
                                they have a heavier duty to pay.”</p>
                            <p>It is not our desire to discuss the relative merits of manufactures
                                from competing countries, as shown in plowing matches in Southern
                                Russia or in any other way, but we would call the attention of the
                                minister of finance and of the mercantile community to this
                                assertion, which is not only made officially by the United States
                                consul, but is corroborated by importers of goods from the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>We cannot afford as a government to rest under such an imputation of
                                unfairness, nor can importers consent to have a market closed
                                against them by a discriminating tariff. The heaviest business done
                                in importations to the River Plate, outside of Buenos Ayres, is by a
                                house which imports almost everything from the United States,
                                including cotton and woolen fabrics, agricultural implements, naval
                                stores, provisions, &amp;c., but this is in Uruguay, where there is
                                no discriminating duty to prevent dealing in the most advantageous
                                market, which would tend to show that there is truth in the charge
                                of the consul; for a charge, and a serious one, it is, if true.</p>
                            <p>Some time since the Herald published the particulars of a
                                steamship-line soon to be put on between New York and Rio de

                                    countries to examine and report concerning the demands of

                                    accredited, with a view to extending the market for American

                                    products to sell in exchange.</p>
                                <p>There is a harmony, then, between our necessities, and the time
                                    seems to have arrived to present our case in such a manner as to
                                    suit Our interests by granting privileges in exchange for
                                    privileges if necessary, and obtaining on our part a reduction
                                    of the export duties on our wool, hides, and other articles of
                                    Argentine production. This will <pb facs="0741" n="7"
                                        xml:id="pg_7"/> develop our commercial relations with the
                                    United States, and as an immediate consequence will increase
                                    direct steam communication, thereby facilitating travel, the
                                    conveyance of merchandise and postal correspondence between the
                                    two countries.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Evarts seems to base his policy on the following arguments
                                    which have been published by the press of this country:</p>
                                <p>The industrial interests of the, United States do not require
                                    free trade. The first duty of a government is the judicious
                                    protection of the productions of the capital and labor of its
                                    own people.</p>
                                <p>The agricultural classes of the West and the manufacturing
                                    classes of the East are mutually interested in the preservation
                                    and promotion of domestic industry, because no one class of
                                    people can long prosper without the co-operation of the
                                    productive labor of the others. Protection is only necessary
                                    when it defends domestic industry against ruinous foreign
                                    competition. By the improvement of machinery, the cost of
                                    production has been considerably diminished in the United
                                    States; a judicious encouragement given to American manufactures
                                    will give greater energy to their competition with foreign
                                    articles.</p>
                                <p>It is neither protection nor free trade that the United States
                                    need, but full trade. The immense productions of the country
                                    require an outlet. Production is in excess of the home demand.
                                    Take iron for instance. In Pennsylvania, there are 478 furnaces
                                    extinguished, the total number being 714; this represents a
                                    paralyzed capital of $100,000,000. The capacity of the total
                                    number of these furnaces is equal to double the demand, and the
                                    same is the case with other industries. Although agricultural
                                    productions are a great source of wealth in the United States,
                                    yet it is necessary to encourage manufacturing and commercial
                                    industry if we are to attain a prominent position among the
                                    nations of the world in the contest of peaceful arts.</p>
                                <p>The domestic exports of the United States during the past year
                                    were as follows: Cotton, $192,000,000; grain, $33,000,000;
                                    wheat, $68,000,000; Hour, $24,000,000; other articles,
                                    $80,000,000.</p>
                                <p>The exports of manufactured articles were: Iron and iron
                                    manufactures, $9,000,000; steel, $450,000; sole leather,
                                    $8,000,000; agricultural implements, $2,500,000.</p>
                                <p>The imports of manufactured articles: Cotton, $20,000,000; flax,
                                    $15,000,000; iron and steel, $10,000,000; silk, $22,000,000;
                                    sugar, $71,000,000; wool and manufactures, $38,000,000.</p>
                                <p>By the aid of wise legislation the greater part of these
                                    manufactured articles can be produced in the United States, and
                                    the hundreds of millions which are annually sent abroad in
                                    payment therefor can be kept at home.</p>
                                <p>Of the total value of the imports to the United States
                                    $315,000,000 were brought in foreign vessels and only
                                    $135,000,000 in American vessels. Thus far Mr. Evarts.</p>
                                <p>Let us now see what the press of the United States says. The
                                    following is an extract from the leading editorial of the New
                                    York Herald of July 18, 1877:</p>
                                <p>“One of the greatest ideas of American statesmen has been with
                                    respect to this closeness of commercial relations between the
                                    United States and the nations of North, Central, and South
                                    America. The possibility of a great American Zollverein or
                                    commercial union, comprising all the States of both American
                                    continents, may be a dream of the future; but it is a dream for
                                    the realization of which every American who desires to serve his
                                    country may well labor with enthusiasm. We are to-day one of the
                                    greatest manufacturing nations of the world. We use more and
                                    better labor-saving machinery than any European nation. Not one
                                    of the other nations on these two continents has paid much
                                    attention to manufactures. They are not like the nations of
                                    Europe, our competitors. They produce principally the raw
                                    material used in manufacturing, which they exchange for
                                    manufactured goods. Thus they will continue for many years to
                                    furnish us an almost unlimited market for our manufactures, if
                                    we only have sufficient shrewdness and foresight to make use of
                                    our advantages. What we require for this purpose is what Mr.
                                    Evarts can do for us; we need new and better commercial
                                    conveniences. A few figures will show how great are the
                                    opportunities (too long neglected by us) to create a market for
                                    our excess of manufactures. Of, the total imports of Mexico,
                                    which amount to $30,000,000, we send only $5,000,000. Canada
                                    imports nearly $130,000,000 per annum, but takes only
                                    $34,000,000 from us, her nearest neighbor. Brazil imports about
                                    $85,000,000, but takes a beggarly seven millions of our
                                    products, although we buy to the amount of $35,000,000 from her.
                                    Chili imports about $40,000,000, but takes only two millions of
                                    our manufactures. The Argentine Confederation imports to the
                                    value of $54,000,000 a year, but buys of us only a million and a
                                    half. The account is as one-sided in almost all the South and
                                    Central American countries. They buy elsewhere, mainly because
                                    they sell their raw materials elsewhere. From Chili, for
                                    instance we bought in 1876, only to the value of $586,000, while
                                    her total exports amounted to over thirty-five millions. The
                                    total exports of the Argentine Confederation amount to over
                                    fifty millions, of which we buy about four millions. It is easy
                                    to see that there is something wrong in all this. We neither buy
                                    nor sell as our skill, the excellence and variety of our
                                    products, and the enterprise of our people would lead us to
                                    expect; and when we look over the figures representing <pb
                                        facs="0742" n="8" xml:id="pg_8"/> the total imports of these
                                    countries who are our neighbors and our natural allies no one
                                    can help seeing what an immense opening there is right here at
                                    our doors for the sale of our surplus products. We can do
                                    without Europe. We need not seek to sell a yard of cloth or a
                                    pound of any manufactured article in Europe, if only we can
                                    command, as we ought, the great and growing commerce of North
                                    and South America.”</p>
                                <p>The Argentine Republic should receive these words of the
                                    government and press of the United States with sympathy and
                                    interest, and co-operate to the extent of its ability in order
                                    to obtain its share of the benefits which must result. Your
                                    excellency will doubtless communicate all necessary information
                                    to the diplomatic and consular officers of the United States in
                                    the Argentine Republic, and suitable instructions to this
                                    legation to enable it properly to sustain our side of the
                                    question.</p>
                                <p>I take pleasure on this occasion in reiterating to your

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your circular with reference to trade between the United
                            States and foreign countries, and it will afford me pleasure to keep the
                            object of the circular in view, and report from time to time. I now beg
                            to call your particular attention to the accompanying report on one
                            important branch of the subject mentioned in the circular. The United
                            States are undoubtedly in a position to supply cheaply most of those
                            labor-saving machines which are being continually brought to perfection
                            and patented in our country, and their superiority over the imitations
                            produced in Europe would command a market for them wherever such
                            machines were used; but as the patentees of useful machines have entire
                            control of a home market, they demand monopoly prices and are unwilling
                            to supply those machines cheaply; they generally prefer to devote their
                            capital to the more lucrative domestic trade, and make little effort to
                            keep control of the foreign market. When you consider that more than
                            fourteen thousand patents are issued annually, and that an improvement
                            in a machine practically gives a patentee control of the export of such
                            machines, it may be imagined that patentees would have no inconsiderable
                            influence on our foreign trade.</p>
                        <p>I have not ventured in this report to detail the facts which indicate
                            that some of our greatest manufactures have deliberately abandoned the
                            foreign trade because foreigners would not pay the high prices to which
                            they were accustomed at home where they had legal control of the market,
                            but I have endeavored to demonstrate that if the law united an arbitrary
                            control of an export trade with a more lucrative monoply at home, the
                            export trade would naturally suffer by the union.</p>
                        <p>The tactics practiced by the combination sewing-machine companies as
                            exposed by the officers of those companies since the foundation patents
                            lapsed, confirms the Conclusion.</p>
                        <p>It occurred to me when I commenced this report that it would be to the
                            interest of patentees to control foreign markets in order to make <pb
                                facs="0743" n="9" xml:id="pg_9"/> sure of the permanent export after
                            the seventeen years of monopoly expired; but it is certain that a
                            mechanic who improves a machine and suddenly has the markets of one
                            great country to supply is seldom qualified or in a position to enter
                            upon a contest in foreign markets which can be controlled only by
                            competing in price as well as quality, and it is not to be presumed that
                            he will withdraw his attention and capital from the most profitable
                            branch of his business for a possible benefit to be attained after
                            seventeen years. His interest is in fact so remote that he cannot be
                            relied upon to supply foreign markets cheaply or to control the
                            manufacture for foreign countries.</p>
                        <p>I have, therefore, ventured to suggest a repeal of that provision of the
                            law which gives patentees control of the export trade in the articles
                            which our country is most capable of supplying, and though I have been
                            unable to find in the several publications concerning patents, or in the
                            discussions which have taken place with reference to the policy of
                            granting patents, any distinction drawn between manufacture for use
                            within the country where the patent is granted, and the manufacture for
                            export, yet I am quite convinced that the distinction is of vital
                            importance to our supremacy in a large class of manufactures, and the
                            very class which the country ought to retain. I believe, so far as the
                            law prohibits free manufacture for export, that it cannot be justified
                            by the principles upon which patent-laws are based; that the prohibition
                            is of little real benefit to patentees, and that it has already been the
                            cause of immense injury to American industry.</p>
                        <p>If it is doubted whether the export trade would be materially affected by
                            freeing it from the arbitrary control of individuals, and permitting the
                            energy of the whole nation to engage in the international competition, I
                            would be glad to submit some facts with reference to the course
                            heretofore pursued by patentees bearing on that point.</p>
                        <p>If the propriety of striking out the word “make” in the patent-law has
                            been discussed in any publication, I would be glad to be advised of the
                            title of the publication, and if such discussion is in a public
                            document, I would be thankful if a copy of it could be forwarded to
                            me.</p>

                            <p>The recent circular to diplomatic and consular officers which enjoins
                                attention to the methods by which trade with foreign countries may
                                be most judiciously fostered, recites that the United States are in
                                a condition to supply cheaply and easily many products and
                                manufactured articles suitable to the wants of different countries.
                                It is to this important part of the subject of the circular that the
                                attention of the Department is at this time invited, in the hope not
                                only that certain American manufacturers may be induced to alter,
                                before it is too late, a course prejudicial to their own interest
                                and to the interest of their country, but also that the Department
                                will be pleased to recommend a repeal of that provision of an
                                otherwise just law which enables any citizen or any foreigner to
                                exclude all other inhabitants of our country from competing in a
                                foreign trade for which our resources are specially adapted and
                                which is open to the competition of all the rest of the world. A
                                legal wrong established, and to which everybody has become
                                accustomed, is often overlooked or supposed to be so connected with
                                some important right that it cannot be abolished, but the object of
                                this report is to point out a wrong injurious to our manufacturers
                                and foreign trade, destructive to the interest it is supposed to
                                foster, and which may be abolished without prejudice to any natural
                                right.</p>
                            <p>A grant for seventeen years of an exclusive right to use and vend the
                                invention or discovery throughout the United States and the
                                Territories thereof, is the wise pro vision <pb facs="0744" n="10"
                                    xml:id="pg_10"/> established by our law for securing a just
                                reward to its author, and is, beyond doubt, the most equitable
                                method of ascertaining the real value of an invention, and of
                                collecting the amount honestly due from the public interested in it.
                                By this method the reward is exactly proportioned to the value of
                                the improvement, and the tax is levied upon those within the limits
                                of the United States who are benefited by it. The sole object of the
                                law is to induce the ingenious to promptly disclose their
                                discoveries, and to compel the beneficiaries within the jurisdiction
                                of the law to remunerate them when they use their devices, and this
                                object is attained when the patentee is granted the exclusive
                                privilege to use and vend throughout the United States and
                                Territories.</p>
                            <p>The patent-law, however, goes one step further than is necessary to
                                secure the object desired. It prohibits all persons within the
                                United States, except the patentee, from making patented articles
                                for foreign markets, although it is quite beyond the power of
                                Congress to grant a monopoly in those markets, or to secure the
                                inventor any rights whatever in foreign countries. As a measure to
                                collect a tax from those in foreign countries who use the invention,
                                this prohibition is useless. Citizens of every other country may
                                compete with the patentee, and citizens of the United States may
                                also compete if they erect their factories and exercise their trade
                                beyond the limits of the United States. The rights of an inventor
                                rest upon positive statutes, and such statutes are justified on
                                grounds of public utility in order to encourage progress in the
                                useful arts, the State abridges the natural right of its citizens to
                                use and vend an article within its boundaries; but to prohibit them
                                from manufacturing for foreign countries abridges their natural
                                rights without contributing to the progress of the arts, and cannot
                                be justified on grounds of public utility. The prohibition is of
                                little benefit to a patentee; it operates as a prohibition upon
                                enterprise within our country for the benefit of foreign
                                manufacturers, and its practical effect has been, and will be, to
                                transfer to a foreign soil industries which have their origin and
                                their natural seat within the United States.</p>
                            <p>It may have been presumed that a patentee would be able and willing
                                to successfully compete for a foreign trade; that ingenuity and
                                patriotism would be found lodged in the same brain, and that
                                individual interest would compel him to manufacture or permit others
                                to manufacture upon terms which would sustain our national credit
                                and the public welfare. The amount of capital invested and the
                                number of factories erected in Austria-Hungary, Germany, and other
                                countries to make patented machines which can be made cheaper and
                                better in America than elsewhere, proves that such a presumption is
                                not well founded: A foreigner obtains letters patent as easily as a
                                citizen, and although the selfish reason why he should desire to
                                exclude all our citizens from competing with him for the trade of
                                other countries is evident, it is by no means clear that patriotism
                                would induce him to use in the interest of our home industries the
                                exclusive right to manufacture for foreign markets granted by our
                                government. Even where a patentee is a patriotic citizen of the
                                United States it can easily be shown that his individual interest is
                                by no means identical with the interest of the public in the
                                industries of the country. The laws enable him to demand profits on
                                his manufactures within our country which it would be vain to expect
                                in countries where he has no monopoly, and it is but natural for him
                                to direct his chief attention to that home business from which he
                                received his greatest immediate profit, and neglect the permanent
                                export trade which might be established in the interest of the
                                nation.</p>
                            <p>A foreign trade is too important and complicated an interest to be
                                committed to the exclusive custody of one person, however large his
                                capital, or superior his qualifications for conducting it. Its vast
                                possibilities may well challenge the energy and resources of a
                                nation, and to patent away any branch of it to one man who may be
                                absolutely unacquainted with commerce, and whose abilities and
                                capital are necessarily occupied in developing his business at home
                                and fulfilling the obligations which the monopoly in his own country
                                imposes upon him, is, from a national point of view, as grotesque as
                                it is deplorable. If a clever mechanic, employed to construct a
                                machine, suggests a new and useful improvement in its construction,
                                it practically abolishes machines without the improvement, and the
                                law intending to reward his ingenuity by giving a temporary monopoly
                                within its jurisdiction actually designates him as a national
                                representative to whose arbitrary authority the entire American
                                foreign trade in those machines is thereafter to be committed, and
                                prohibits the slightest interference on the part of his countrymen,
                                while he carries on an unequal contest with foreign enterprise and
                                accumulated capital in every part of the world. If he has ability
                                enough to enter upon such a contest, he will be likely to have
                                independence enough to insist on the business being conducted
                                according to his peculiar ideas, which, not having been modified by
                                commercial experience, may be quite impracticable, as for instance
                                where an American patentee refused to sell his foreign agents a
                                machine on which he could make 300 per cent. profit, unless he could
                                also sell wooden stands to support the machine, which were much more
                                cheaply furnished in the country to which they were to be sent, the
                                freight on a common and bulky article being more than its cost.</p>
                            <p>Thus commercial blunders and monopoly prices are driving from our
                                country industries in which there is more skill, for which there are
                                better materials, and which can <pb facs="0745" n="11"
                                    xml:id="pg_11"/> be more cheaply conducted there than elsewhere.
                                Particularly is this true with reference to American labor saving
                                machines, and in order that the statement may not be considered
                                vague and disregarded, the American foreign trade in sewing-machines
                                may be cited as an example. Those machines have been sold here for
                                years at a much higher price than similar European machines were
                                offered for, but with the hard times people have been compelled to
                                exercise more economy, and they are now beginning to accept at a
                                less cost machines capable of doing the same work made on the
                                continent. That the heads of sewing-machines can be made in America
                                and sold in this market at a fair manufacturers’ profit, and at a
                                price which would have defied Austrian and German competition, if
                                the factories now established had not been built up under the shadow
                                of the American monopoly, is the opinion of those engaged in the
                                business and in a position to judge. The exactcst is best known to
                                the manufacturers, but the cost of a machine is not such a profound
                                mystery that it cannot be estimated. Why, then, is the country being
                                deprived of this foreign trade?</p>
                            <p>A slight acquaintance with the manner in which the business has been
                                conducted at home and abroad, coupled with the declarations of the
                                officers of the combination companies since the foundation patents
                                have expired, prove beyond question that the foreign trade has not
                                been competed for in a legitimate commercial manner, and that this
                                neglect is in consequence of its improper connection with monopoly
                                privileges in America. There, protected by patents, manufacturers
                                were able to demand and obtain extraordinary prices, and when the
                                combination patents lapsed, in May last, a reduction to one-half
                                their former prices was publicly announced, and the published
                                statements of some of the principal patentees admitted that profit
                                could be realized even with a greater reduction in price, but they
                                declared that when their prices were 100 per cent. higher, much of
                                their profits had been expended in forcing the market by means of
                                canvassing-agents, bills, and pamphlets; that the cost of selling a
                                machine was greater than the cost of producing it; that commissions
                                of from 40 to 60 per cent. had been paid to agents and collectors;
                                and the president of one company stated that they had spent
                                $1,000,000 in advertising, and $1,000,000 in litigation. However
                                necessary such expenses may have been for the protection of the
                                monopoly at home, they, were not properly chargeable against
                                machines made for export to foreign countries where canvassers would
                                be adjudged a public nuisance, and where there was no monopoly nor
                                litigation to sustain it.</p>
                            <p>When the law unites a home monopoly with the control of a foreign
                                trade, it is not wonderful that the industry should escape from the
                                country to obtain a divorce. The one, based on its special
                                privileges and defended by expensive litigation, regulates its
                                prices with reference to extraordinary commissions and expenses; the
                                other must ever be based on quality and price, and there is no
                                method of securing and retaining a foreign trade but by furnishing a
                                good article at a cheaper rate.</p>
                            <p>Foreign capitalists were not slow in discovering that sewing-machines
                                could be produced and profitably sold at a much lower price than was
                                demanded by American manufacturers; they were advised that a royalty
                                was levied on machines made in America; that the patentees in
                                America declined to furnish heads for export at less than three
                                times the cost of producing them; that the principal manufacturers
                                had rapidly amassed great fortunes, $13,000,000 being the
                                accumulations of one of them in a few years. These were the
                                circumstances which encouraged foreign capitalists to build
                                factories and to embark in an industry notwithstanding the
                                disadvantages of inferior resources, little skill, and no
                                experience; and had American manufacturers offered these products in
                                the foreign markets on commercial principles, these reasons for
                                building factories on this continent would not have existed. It was
                                not cheaper capital, or cheaper labor, or greater experience which
                                established this competition abroad; it may be traced directly to
                                the large profits which American patentees have been accustomed to
                                consider as their just right, and which they have attempted to exact
                                in foreign markets where no such right is recognized or-protected by
                                law. It is probably true that the royalty paid on machines for
                                export was only one-third the royalty exacted on those sold at home,
                                but even then the royalty on each head is stated to have been nearly
                                one-third the cost of producing it, and a profit of 30 per cent. is
                                no small inducement to European manufacturers.</p>
                            <p>Now that the principal patents have lapsed, the combination which
                                controlled them as well as other American manufactures would
                                doubtless be glad to secure a steady export trade at moderate
                                profits, but our country must now pay the penalty of years of
                                neglect by competing with capital already invested, and which must
                                continue to produce, however small the profits realized. The law
                                relaxes its hold on American energy after the mischief has been
                                done. For seventeen years it has prohibited everyone but the
                                patentee from competing for this foreign business, the manufacture
                                abroad has been stimulated, foreign factories have been built, and
                                are in full operation, the skill has been transferred to them which
                                should have been employed at home, and the contest between American
                                and foreign enterprise is no longer equal. Our people cannot now
                                afford to commence the building of factories to compete with foreign
                                factories already built. To prohibit our citizens for sevent en
                                years from competing for <pb facs="0746" n="12" xml:id="pg_12"/>
                                some special branch of a foreign trade, will generally be found to
                                be equivalent to excluding them from it forever.</p>
                            <p>It is therefore respectfully submitted whether in the interest of
                                American industry the manufacture of patented articles for foreign
                                markets ought not to be free to every citizen. This is not an attack
                                on the rights of that most meritorious class who carry forward
                                improvements in the useful arts. The writer is an earnest and
                                persistent advocate of those principles of comity and justice which
                                would secure the equitable rights of inventors at home and abroad,
                                and in his report on patent laws dated September 30, 1871, and
                                printed in the “Commercial Relations, 1872,” pages 49, 50, and 51,
                                it was suggested that “the lack of treaty stipulations and of
                                established principles of international law concerning the rights of
                                foreign inventors, may, perhaps, at some future time, be cited in
                                evidence of the semi-barbarism of the present age.” The injustice of
                                foreign patent laws cannot be remedied by an act of Congress. The
                                privileges of inventors in foreign lands rest upon local law, unless
                                defined by treaty. If the injustice pointed out in that report had
                                been entirely removed by treaties, the provision of the law granting
                                a foreign trade to a patentee would be lees unjust and less
                                instrumental in destroying the manufacturing interest of our
                                country.</p>
                            <p>It is not contemplated to curtail in the slightest degree any
                                exclusive privilege which our law has power to guarantee, but it
                                cannot grant an inventor an exclusive market in foreign countries.
                                The patentee is asked to yield to his own countrymen only the rights
                                which are enjoyed by every other person out of the United States.
                                His monopoly is within the country, not out of it, and in claiming
                                the exclusive privilege to “make,” he excludes his own countrymen
                                from profiting by a foreign trade to which he has no special legal
                                right, and from which the inhabitants of no other country are
                                excluded. English, French, and German manufacturers have free access
                                to the foreign manger, while the approach from the American side is
                                guarded by a well-fed monopolist, who will neither compete for the
                                trade himself nor allow his fellow-citizens to compete for it. If
                                the patentee foregoes his royalty on exports, he has neither
                                interest in nor benefit from the foreign trade; if he exacts it he
                                handicaps American competition; and from a national point of view
                                the wisdom of permitting a short-lived monopoly to strangle a
                                permanent and profitable industry would equal that which would kill
                                the goose which laid a golden egg. The interest which a patentee has
                                in the export trade is generally remote; the interest which a nation
                                has is immediate, and ought to be promptly secured.</p>
                            <p>Patents are sometimes granted for improvements which, even under a
                                just law, could not be patented abroad, for it by no means follows
                                that an invention is really new because a man swears it is new to
                                him. A system which had been in constant and general use for
                                generations might be patented; the question is not whether it has
                                been known abroad, but whether a description has been published, and
                                at this time antiquarian literature is being ransacked for the
                                published description of a process recently patented in America,
                                which is alleged to have been in common use in Europe for over half
                                a century.</p>
                            <p>It may be said that if the right to manufacture for the foreign trade
                                were allowed, it might lead to a violation of the exclusive right to
                                use and vend within the United States. For certain sewing-machines
                                heretofore manufactured, only one-third the royalty was demanded by
                                patentees when the machines were exported”, compared with the
                                royalty paid on those for domestic use. This proves that it is
                                possible to distinguish between the two, and the law can certainly
                                provide such safeguards as may be necessary for the full protection
                                of domestic rights without destroying the rights which all Americans
                                have in the foreign trade.</p>
                            <p>Under the law as it now stands, a foreigner who has no intention of
                                manufacturing in our country, may nevertheless obtain a patent there
                                in order to prevent American competition in other countries. Upon
                                what theory can that be defended?</p>
                            <p>The importance of the principle involved justifies the length of this
                                report, and the conclusion is submitted with diffidence. All the
                                authorities on patent law attainable here have been carefully
                                examined, but no distinction has been found between making for
                                export or for domestic use. Europeans are divided in opinion as to
                                the policy of having any patent laws, and in those countries where
                                they have not been totally abolished they are so framed and
                                administered as to be of little practical use to a non-resident; but
                                in the discussions which have taken place it has not been observed
                                that this principle has entered into the argument. In a recent
                                publication now at hand, the history of property in inventions, and
                                the principles upon which patent laws are based, are clearly stated
                                and the American system, its principles and effects, ably supported
                                but there is nothing in it to indicate that the attention of its
                                author had been ever called to the effect which our patent law has
                                upon our foreign trade. Though unable to cite authority to support
                                the proposition to strike out the word “make” from our patent law,
                                it is not known to have ever been condemned by authority. Even if it
                                had never been thought of or discussed, it would not prove and ought
                                not to raise a presumption that it is not worthy of discussion. It
                                is the fundamental principle of patent laws that; it is possible to
                                discover and disclose new and useful improvements, <pb facs="0747"
                                    n="13" xml:id="pg_13"/> and the principle applies with equal
                                force when the improvement proposed is in the patent law itself. If
                                the supremacy to which our country is entitled in the manufacture of
                                certain kinds of machinery has been destroyed or impaired by one
                                unadvised word in a statute, it is important that the fact should be
                                generally known. That this word might produce such an effect will
                                hardly be thought extraordinary when we consider that it consigns
                                the international contest to the custody of individuals in no
                                position to prosecute it with vigor and according to sound

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the circular of the
                            Department of State, “Separate,” August, 1877, on the subject of
                            augmenting trade between the United States and foreign nations, I have
                            the honor to state that, although the topic has for several years
                            frequently engaged my attention, I have never felt less able to report
                            upon it satisfactorily, at least to myself, than now. It is no small
                            gratification to me, who have for forty years earnestly advocated the
                            cause of protection to American industry, to find this policy at last
                            triumphantly vindicated in an official announcement by the Department of
                            State, that the United States “are in a condition to supply cheaply and
                            easily many * * * manufactured articles suitable to the wants of the
                            different countries”; and to find in English newspapers at the same time
                            such singular confirmation of the fact as the following short citations
                            from the report of a speech by Sir Stafford Northcote, present: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The most marvelous aspect of the economical problem is, that
                                    free-trade principles, the soundness of which has been
                                    indubitably demonstrated by practical experience in this country
                                    [England] for thirty years, should still be obstinately resisted
                                    by nearly all other civilized communities to their own probable
                                    detriment, with a degree of perverseness utterly
                                    incomprehensible in a nation transcendently distinguished for
                                    industrial and commercial enterprise. The people of the United
                                    States still appear to cherish or the most part the suicidal
                                    illusion that they are enriched in proportion as they place
                                    fiscal obstructions in the way of foreign manufactures entering
                                    their ports, provided it is in their power to match them by the
                                    products of national labor even at a higher cost. * * * American
                                    calicoes are reported to meet with increasing acceptance in
                                    Manchester. The saws and cutlery of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh
                                    are sometimes <pb facs="0748" n="14" xml:id="pg_14"/> preferred
                                    to similar manufactures produced in Sheffield. The machine-made
                                    watches of Waltham threaten to supplant the solid horologic
                                    workmanship of Coventry. Leather from the United States evokes
                                    from the tanners of Bermondsey the confession that they are no
                                    longer able to sell the same material of a certain quality
                                    against the transatlantic product. Agricultural implements
                                    bearing the trade-mark of a New York company are to be found
                                    exposed for sale in English hardware-shops.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In thus conclusively proving by instances and examples the wisdom and
                            success of a policy which he has just exhausted his vocabulary in
                            abusing, the orator gives us the finest specimen of the “logically
                            incongruous” that I know. At first view it would seem that if we can
                            compete with England on her own soil in such important articles of
                            manufacture, we certainly can do so elsewhere: but in this consular
                            district, for which alone I am required to speak, this does not follow.
                            Time; distance; communication, direct, regular, frequent; channels of
                            trade long established; mercantile connections of old date;
                            preoccupation of the market, and perhaps still other elements of
                            success, are all against us. Even for the foreign trade of by far the
                            greater part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Trieste and Fiume cannot
                            compete with Bremen and Hamburg, as a glance at their position on a
                            globe will show.</p>
                        <p>A few articles of large bulk, such as can bear shipment in
                            sailing-vessels—resin, petroleum, tobacco—come, and will continue to
                            come here; and enterprising merchants, who have been in the United
                            States or who have special means of knowing our productions, are and
                            will continue to be on the watch for any manufacture that can be
                            profitably sold, in spite of the advantages possessed by English and
                            continental competitors. That foreign manufactures in great variety and
                            considerable value find sale here, the annual commercial tables of the
                            port show; they show, also, how small in number and value are those
                            produced in the United States. Swift’s Laputans obtained water-power by
                            pumping the river to the top of the mountain, and their mills were a
                            success so long as capital for the pumping lasted. Any effort to conquer
                            and control the Trieste market perforce, by stocking it with United
                            States products, would be, in my opinion, doing business on Laputan
                            principles. I presume that no such project is entertained. If it be,
                            there is another point to be considered.</p>
                        <p>The foreboding expressed m this correspondence (Commercial Relations,
                            1865, page 352), several years since, that Trieste, for reasons there
                            stated, might soon be without a “commercial back country,” appears to
                            have been but too well grounded; and, if my observations and the
                            concurrent testimony of merchants, with whom I have conversed, be
                            trustworthy, this place is rapidly losing its comparative position as an
                            emporium, and declining to the condition of a port of transshipment. The
                            great development of telegraphic, postal, and railroad systems, and of
                            English, French, Italian, and Austrian lines of steamships, has produced
                            the natural result of bringing producer and consumer into closer
                            relations, and many a Trieste “middleman” finds his occupation going, if
                            not gone already.</p>
                        <p>The merchant of the Orient and the manufacturer of Europe are ceasing to
                            purchase—the one, fabrics, the other, raw materials—in Trieste; both go
                            to the source, and the merchant here sees nothing of the merchandise but
                            its transshipment at the wharf. Under these circumstances it would be
                            Laputan policy for the United States manufacturer to store goods here in
                            the hope of occasionally intercepting an order from the Levant; and the
                            local market is decidedly too insignificant to induce him to take any
                            such risk. But, provided one great disadvantage under which we labor
                            could be removed, I have long believed Trieste might be made of great
                            value to us in opening a trade with the Orient, especially <pb
                                facs="0749" n="15" xml:id="pg_15"/> in the products of the loom and
                            the anvil, perhaps even the fabrics of wood and leather.</p>
                        <p>A merchant of Cairo, for instance, telegraphs an order to Germany for
                            cottons or woolens. In twelve or fifteen days his goods can be in his
                            warehouse. If the order be to England, it makes but some ten days’
                            difference, with probably some saving in expense of freight, inasmuch as
                            the steamship is cheaper than the steam-car, and there is no
                            transshipment at Trieste or elsewhere. If to the United States, the
                            merchant must wait the slow motions of a sailing vessel—sixty to eighty
                            days—or transship at some English port. When the United States can
                            remove or overcome this difficulty, or can produce fabrics of such
                            quality and prices as to counterbalance it, it will only be necessary to
                            make them known, in order to begin, at least, a commerce, which in time
                            may prove successful in spite of all the other impediments enumerated
                            above. Since the submarine telegraph has placed England and the United
                            States practically on equal terms as to the time needed for the receipt
                            of orders from the Levant, it would certainly seem possible to devise
                            some means of delivering our merchandise there with sufficient
                            promptness and economy to secure a profitable trade. Possibly the time
                            has come when the late Austrian Consul-General Loosey’s favorite project
                            of a line of steamers from New York to Trieste, touching at intermediate
                            ports, might succeed, a problem on which I am not prepared to express an
                            opinion, but which perhaps may be worth solving by experiment. At all
                            events, with such a line Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania could
                            fill an order from Alexandria or Smyrna within so few days of the time
                            in which England could do it, that it could make no essential difference
                            to the purchaser.</p>
                        <p>The markets of this consular district may safely be left to private
                            enterprise; for the desire of gain brings the trader to a far keener
                            insight into local commercial matters than any consul can possess. But
                            there is another aspect of the question: “Of methods by which trade with
                            the United States can be most judiciously fostered at or through this
                            port.”</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the fact that the completion of certain lines of railroad
                            in Italy and the establishment of divers new Oriental lines of
                            steamships from other ports, have greatly reduced the passenger traffic
                            at Trieste, still this port is the one in this part of the world where
                            merchants of the Levant at certain seasons of the year most do
                            congregate; it is that from which the most frequent and regular
                            communication by steam and sail with the Orient exists; it is that
                            which, since the decline of Venice, has had and still has the largest
                            and closest commercial relations with Levantine ports; that from which
                            their markets can, on the whole, be most easily and effectually
                            influenced, and must continue so, so long as it remains a free port.
                            Trieste, then, is the point from which a knowledge of the manufactures
                            of the United States can most readily and widely be spread throughout
                            all the countries bordering the eastern Mediterranean. And this could be
                            effected by an exhibition here of a collection of the products of the
                            United States, especially of articles of common demand and utility from
                            our factories aud workshops. I have said “exhibition”—a huge
                            “sample-warehouse” would be the better term.</p>
                        <p>Such a project could meet no custom-house impediments, while the local
                            authorities, I have reason to think, would highly favor it. If the
                            United States take part in the Paris Exhibition, at its close why should
                            not those classes of articles in which our manufacturers can rival those
                            of England and the Continent be transferred hither? The effects of <pb
                                facs="0750" n="16" xml:id="pg_16"/> our failure at Vienna, on public
                            opinion in this part of the world, might thus be remedied.</p>
                        <p>The advantages of such a sample-warehouse, kept open one or two years
                            under the auspices of the government or of the chambers of commerce of
                            the United States, are too obvious to require enumeration, and, it would
                            seem, would soon create a demand for the productions of our industry and
                            skill, which would amply repay the comparatively small expense to be
                            incurred. At all events it would yield the Oriental merchant an
                            opportunity to compare our cottons, woolens, tools, fabrics of iron,
                            wood, and leather, &amp;c., with those of Europe on the shelves of the
                            neighboring warehouses, both in price and quality, and furnish him the
                            useful basis for deciding whether to telegraph his orders to Europe or
                            across the Atlantic.</p>
                        <p>The idea of such an exhibition has been so long before my mind, as to
                            appear to me no longer Quixotic or Laputan; on the contrary, both
                            rational and feasible; and should the United States Government appoint
                            commissioners to the Paris Exhibition, I should hope to see one or more
                            of them quietly examining the project on the spot,</p>
                        <p>In this hope, I remain, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In answer to your circular of August 7, I
                            have the honor to report that I am of opinion that the commercial
                            relations between the United States and Bohemia can be largely
                            developed.</p>
                        <p>The greatest obstacle to this, hitherto existing, has been the want of
                            direct communication between the merchants and manufacturers of America
                            and those of Bohemia.</p>
                        <p>Americans have allowed English and German merchants to be the organs of
                            intercommunication, thus causing a loss of time and money.</p>
                        <p>There is a large market here for many of the patented articles of
                            machinery and agricultural implements and tools, made in America by
                            machinery, and made here by hand.</p>
                        <p>Bohemia is largely an agricultural country, and has been greatly
                            dependent for tools on England, which has had but little
                            competition.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">American pianos and organs</hi> would find a larger
                            sale here if the manufacturers were properly represented. In some places
                            cottage-organs have been introduced with success into country
                            churches.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mineral oil.</hi>—The consumption of petroleum is large
                            and constantly increasing. It is sold to this country mainly by houses
                            in Hamburg, Bremen, and Antwerp. It has already supplanted the petroleum
                            of Gallicia, in Poland, which was formerly used, and its sale could be
                            indefinitely increased.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Resin</hi>, brought from America to Hamburg and Bremen
                            as ballast in sailing-vessels, is used in considerable quantities by
                            manufacturers.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Tallow and lard</hi> are much consumed by
                            manufacturers.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Grass-seed</hi>.— The <hi rend="italic">Poa
                                pratensis</hi> is sold in the largest quantity.</p>
                        <p>But, as I have remarked the sale of American produce and manufactures <pb
                                facs="0751" n="17" xml:id="pg_17"/> would be largely increased in
                            all its bran ches if agents were here to meet purchasers in person.</p>
                        <p>The preceding remarks regarding the intervention of third parties is
                            equally applicable under this head. The raw products of Bohemia, such as
                            talc, graphite, red-clay, goat skins, and the manufactures of glass,
                            porcelain, garnets, woolen cloths, laces, and toys, would be greatly
                            cheapened to the United States if obtained directly from Bohemia.</p>
                        <p>It is proper to add that some of the most elegant and costly furniture
                            sold in London is made in Prague, some specimens of which I have
                            recently examined. The ingenuity and beauty of the designs is largely
                            owing to industrial schools and academies of art.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of a copy of your separate instructions to the diplomatic and
                            consular officers of the United States, under date of 18th July,
                            inviting ray attention to the fact that it is believed that the period
                            has arrived when it would be wise for all the nations of this continent
                            to consider more carefully than here-toforehow they may best enlarge
                            their trade with each other, and instructing them to devote their
                            attention to such methods by which trade with the United States can be
                            most judiciously fostered. In reply, I beg to most respectfully state
                            that, after a residence of almost six years at this capital, during
                            which time I have carefully studied the commercial relations between the
                            United States and this empire, I have become thoroughly satisfied that
                            with more extended facilities in the way of transportation, and with a
                            careful and systematic dissemination of knowledge as to the commercial
                            demands of this country, our commerce with it ought to, and would, in my
                            opinion, be largely increased. At an early future, I hope (in pursuance
                            of my instructions) to be able to lay before your Department a more
                            extensive report upon this subject than I have hitherto been able to
                            give, which, if it should result in directing our factors, merchants,
                            and producers to a more careful consideration of the inducements offered
                            in this vast empire, will have accomplished its end.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring tayour separate circular dated
                            July 16, 1877, I have now the honor to make the following report in
                            reply thereto:</p>
                        <p>You will please allow me to remark, by way of preface, that the circular
                            is a recognition of the patent fact that one of the most important
                            duties of American statesmanship is to bring into operation all
                            legitimate means and agencies to secure to the United States a fair
                            share of the trade of our neighbors in this hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>According to the latest statistics, the foreign commerce of the countries
                            lying south of the United States, on the American continent, may be
                            nearly estimated to be, at the present time, $520,000,000 in value, a
                            sum nearly equal to one-half of the whole foreign commerce of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Of the $112,350,000 of our commerce with the states south of us on this
                            hemisphere, probably not more than one-third consists in our domestic
                            exports to them; for example, according to the Bureau of Statistics, the
                            United States received, in 1876, from Brazil, Argentine Republic,
                            Uruguay, and Venezuela, $56,736,176 of imports, and sent those states
                            only $13,322,809 domestic exports. During the same year, and according
                            to the same authority, we received from Mexico $12,505,753 in imports,
                            and sent to that state $4,706,778. The balance of trade, therefore,
                            appears to be largely against us, and if the old rule be true (as I
                            believe) in political as well as private economy, that he who sells more
                            of his produce to his neighbors than he buys of theirs makes more
                            profits out of them than they out of him, the states south of us are
                            deriving a much larger profit from the United States than the United
                            States are deriving from them. It is lamentable to note, in this
                            connection, that we only carry in our own bottoms about one-third of the
                            whole value of our trade with the states south of us, so we are not
                            large gainers by the freight on the articles we receive from and send to
                            them. This is not, however, true in regard to Central America, for our
                            entire trade with it is carried by means of our own ships.</p>
                        <pb facs="0753" n="19" xml:id="pg_19"/>
                        <p>The products of our factories are fully equal, and in many classes
                            superior, to those of Europe. Our breadstuff’s should find a ready
                            market in that vast area of this hemisphere embraced within the tropics.
                            Our proximity and a certain sympathy arising therefrom, and from some
                            similarity of institutions, ought to give us an advantage over European
                            competition. Yet the United States enjoy but a fractional part of this
                            trade, when by energy upon the part of our merchants and manufacturers
                            and well-directed statesmanship we might reap the benefits of nearly the
                            whole. With our superior civilization and more persistent energy we
                            ought to become the manufacturers for the peoples south of us. With our
                            immense extent of sea, lake, and river coast, and our great supplies of
                            iron, coal, and timber, we ought, it would seem, to be able to supply
                            sailors and vessels to do all the carrying-trade between them and the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>I do not aspire to take a conspicuous part in the solution of this great
                            problem, and shall be content if the following report may contain some
                            useful hints on this most interesting subject, so far as it is connected
                            with the states of Central America. By reference to my No. 40, dated
                            October 16,1873, and the circular-letter therewith sent, you will
                            observe that immediately after entering upon the discharge of my duties
                            I began to devote myself to the study of this subject in its relations
                            to the Central American States, and my dispatches from time to time
                            since have contained various suggestions in connection therewith.
                            Notwithstanding I feel my inability to make such an exhaustive report as
                            would be fully responsive to the scope of inquiry embraced in your
                            circular of the 16th July, I shall give you such information as I have
                            gathered and express such opinions as may appear pertinent.</p>
                        <p>1. My experience here in collecting information upon commercial and
                            financial subjects confirms the opinion expressed in my No. 40, and
                            subsequent dispatches, of the necessity of a reorganization of our
                            consular service in Central America as a first step toward facilitating
                            the acquisition of information that may lead to the removal of some of
                            the obstacles to our obtaining a larger share of the trade of these
                            States. If a consul-generalship were created, the gentleman filling that
                            position would be entitled to require of consular officers reports upon
                            the commerce of their respective localities, which those officers are
                            not bound to give in response to the inquiries of a minister who has no
                            direct legal authority over them.</p>
                        <p>Without intending to reflect upon the members of our consular service in
                            Central America (some of whom are very efficient), I beg leave to say
                            that it has been most difficult for me to get consular officers to
                            procure even the official, commercial, and financial reports published
                            by the governments of the countries in which they reside. It may be
                            added that although I am in correspondence with all of them of every
                            grade I have never had the good fortune in a single instance to receive
                            from any of them a copy of a commercial report. This statement is not
                            made with a view of censuring them, for it is no part of their duty to
                            make such reports to a minister. If they had an intelligent chief,
                            either by the creation of the office of consul-general or by superadding
                            that office to that of the minister, as I have several times had the
                            honor to suggest, the consular officers would be obliged to make their
                            reports to him, and could be required to give detailed and special
                            information on commercial subjects.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the consular officers in these States make their reports to the
                            Department as regularly as those in other quarters, but it has been
                            mortifying to me to witness that so few of them have furnished
                            information <pb facs="0754" n="20" xml:id="pg_20"/> thought worthy of
                            publication with the annual Report of the Secretary on the subject of
                            commercial relations.</p>
                        <p>Possibly I attach too much importance to the necessity of a
                            reorganization of our consular service, yet, entertaining the opinions I
                            do, it would be remissness on my part to fail in giving them expression
                            upon replying to your circular.</p>
                        <p>2. There is no doubt in my mind but that our merchants and manufacturers
                            have, owing to our high tariff and the great commercial prosperity of
                            the United States until within the last few years, found such profitable
                            markets at home that they have not thought it worth while to trouble
                            themselves to study the tastes and habits of our Central American
                            neighbors. Taking the “newspaper-man” as ail exponent of intelligence,
                            one might say there is a lamentable ignorance prevailing in our country
                            as to what is the geographical position of these countries; for items of
                            news from Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica have
                            been often seen in some of our leading newspapers under the caption of
                            “South America.” Mr. Stephens’s and Mr. Squier’s most interesting books
                            have seemed to create an impression that these States are more fitting
                            for the explorations of seekers after American antiquities than for the
                            more practical pursuits of the “commercial traveler.” Socially and
                            politically these populations may be nearly stagnant, but their
                            increased volume of foreign commerce indicates that agriculturally and
                            commercially they are moving onward.</p>
                        <p>Without apparently an effort upon the part of our countrymen, and. in the
                            face of some disadvantages which are hereafter pointed out, our trade
                            with Central America increased from $943,654, in 1864, to nearly six
                            millions in 1874, according to my commercial report accompanying
                            dispatch No. 407. There has been a considerable falling off in the
                            volume of our trade with them since that year. This result has been due,
                            in my judgment, mainly to the enterprise of German and French mer chants
                            and manufacturers, and to the lack of interest in these countries felt
                            by our traders; for the commercial statistics in respect to Brazil,
                            Mexico, Chili, and Peru show that wherever American merchants and
                            manufacturers have taken the trouble to seek trade in Spanish America,
                            they have always been rewarded by partial if not complete success.</p>
                        <p>From these remarks it will be seen that in my opinion, and according to
                            my observations, the fields of commerce in Central America have not been
                            cultivated by our commercial people, and that the employment of more
                            enterprise in this quarter is likely to yield a satisfactory harvest.
                            They may become the harvesters and cease to be the gleaners
                            notwithstanding the obstacles hereafter mentioned.</p>
                        <p>3. It might be supposed from our having so little commerce with Central
                            America, and Great Britain so much, that the latter country has more
                            commercial men residing here than the United States. Such a supposition
                            would be incorrect. There are more American than British merchants in
                            these States, and more German tlian of any other nationality. The
                            Germans are, in fact, in charge of the principal commercial
                            establishments in every one of these States. Although they export to and
                            import from other countries more largely perhaps than they do to and
                            from Germany, they derive a much larger share of the profits than their
                            correspondents, and Germany is therefore profiting, in my judgment, more
                            by the Central American trade than any other country.</p>
                        <p>The system pursued by the German merchants in these countries appears to
                            be an admirable one. I cannot pretend to give you the whole of the
                            system but only one important feature of it. As a clerk shows himself
                            competent to manage business he is gradually promoted in pay, <pb
                                facs="0755" n="21" xml:id="pg_21"/> until he becomes a partner with
                            a small share of the profits. When his fitness to take charge of the
                            business is pretty clearly established his interest is increased, and
                            the elder partners retire to Europe, leaving to the new partner the
                            local management. Three of the largest commercial establishments in
                            Central America are now conducted by Germans who were clerks,at very
                            small salaries less than fifteen years ago.</p>
                        <p>The Germans and not the British, in my judgment, are our real competitors
                            for the trade of the whole of Spanish America. The practical commercial
                            training of their young men gives them an immense advantage over us. The
                            facility of the German in acquiring languages is in unhappy contrast
                            with our heretofore notorious national deficiency in speaking foreign
                            tongues, and is an advantage not to be gainsaid. The low interest upon
                            money in Germany is another advantage, and the readiness with which the
                            wealthy Germans give credit or intrust money to their enterprising young
                            men of good character and fair training gives Germans opportunities of
                            doing business in Spanish America which few of our young countrymen
                            could expect to obtain.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the subject of the Spanish language, I would unhesitatingly
                            recommend that its study be encouraged in all our schools (and
                            especially commercial) in preference to French or German. The best
                            “openings,” as they are called, for our young men in commerce,
                            engineering, dentistry, and medicine are in Spanish America, but without
                            a knowledge of the Spanish language it will be most difficult for
                            progress to be made. To know how to write and speak that language
                            fluently is the best passport and recommendation a young man can have
                            among Central Americans. All his letters will be of little service
                            unless he speaks “the idiom.” If he happily speaks that well, he
                            receives a degree of marked attention from the natives that would
                            surprise him. In truth, if we are to have a continental policy,
                            commercially or otherwise, we must know more of our Spanish American
                            neighbors, and above all know their language. It is easy of acquisition
                            and beautiful in construction.</p>
                        <p>4. But when our consular service in Central America is better organized;
                            when our merchants and manufacturers use greater energy in endeavoring
                            to secure a fair share of its trade; when German competi-tion is less to
                            be feared because our young men have become equally well-trained and are
                            trusted with credit and money as the young German, still there may be
                            difficulties of detail to be removed. These I shall now attempt to
                            mention briefly under one heading.</p>
                        <p>The statements are made partly upon the authority of reliable merchants,
                            and partly as the results of my own observations and experience.</p>
                        <p>Insurance from New York to Central American ports is 2 per cent.; that
                            from European ports 1 per cent. Commissions in New York for buying and
                            selling are 5 per cent., and in Europe 2½ per cent. Interest in New York
                            and San Francisco is higher than in Europe, and credits for goods and
                            for money are shorter. American packing is notoriously bad, and European
                            packing is most artistically done, with the intelligent view of
                            diminishing bulk and securing the safe delivery of the article
                            packed.</p>
                        <p>Why commissions should be so much higher in the United States than in
                            Europe has never been satisfactorily explained, nor have I been able to
                            understand why our packing should be almost uniformly worse than English
                            or French. I will give some hints on this subject, which is so important
                            when it is considered that the goods received in Central America have to
                            pay very high freights and are subject to the roughest handling.</p>
                        <pb facs="0756" n="22" xml:id="pg_22"/>
                        <p>Packages should never be large. They should be as securely put up as
                            possible. The smallest waste in space should be avoided if possible.
                            Cotton goods should be subjected to hydraulic or steam pressure, and
                            then be wrapped in coarse blaukets, coverlets, &amp;c. (which pay no
                            duty if used as packing), water-proof material, and bagging. I have
                            often been shown American cotton goods, that have been damaged by water,
                            but have never yet seen a single instance of a like kind resulting from
                            European packing. The charge for packing in the United States is much
                            higher than in Europe, and I must say from my own personal experience
                            that it nearly deserves the bad name it has in these States. I think,
                            however, we are improving in the art of packing.</p>
                        <p>As I have not had the good fortune to have a commercial training, I
                            express myself with reluctance upon some parts of this subject, and
                            particularly on the following:</p>
                        <p>The advertisements and circulars and price-lists of our countrymen lack
                            that precise explicitness in respect to details which is found
                            particularly in English and French papers of a similar kind. In
                            house-furnishing and in making purchases of dry goods, groceries,
                            &amp;c., for domestic use, (in which I have had some experience), I beg
                            to say I have been mortified at the difference between the leading New
                            York dry-goods store and a leading London dry-goods shop, between the
                            leading New York house-furnishing and a London house-furnishing shop,
                            between the leading San Francisco dealers in canned goods and an English
                            shop dealing in the same class of goods, between a leading New York
                            clothier and a respectable tailor of Paris or London, not only in the
                            matter of prices, but in the complete and full responses to inquiries
                            one gets from the European market, and the hurriedly-written,
                            incomplete, and often impatient replies from my countrymen. As a general
                            rule, the English and French circulars, illustrated catalogues, and
                            other forms of advertising are models of thorough exactness and
                            minuteness of details, and are worthy of closer imitation by oar
                            manufacturers and merchants who have attempted to follow their lead.</p>
                        <p>5. It will be seen from the following statement of freights that San
                            Francisco enjoys, in respect to them, a great advantage over any
                            American or European city, but that New York, notwithstanding her
                            proximity has scarcely an appreciable advantage over London, Havre,
                            Southampton, and Hamburg. The rates given are for staple articles, such
                            as coffee, and average goods exported and imported to and from San José
                            de Guatemala. They have been furnished me by one of the most respectable
                            houses of this city. Freight by steamer from San Francisco, to and from
                            San José de Guatemala, is $15 per ton; New York, to and from same, 85
                            cents per cubic foot and 13/5 cents per pound, or $34 by measurement and
                            $32 by weight; London, to and from same, $37.50 per ton and 5 per cent.
                            primage from San José to London; Southampton, to and from same, $31.25
                            auVl 5 per cent. primage; Havre, to and from same, $36.25 and 5 per
                            cent. primage; Hamburg, to and from same, $35 and 5 per cent. primage.
                            By sailing-vessels from San Francisco freight to and from San José is
                            $8, $10, and $12 per ton, depending upon charter. By sailing vessels
                            from ports of great Britain, France, and Germany, to San José, freight
                            is $10, and $15 per ton back to those ports.</p>
                        <p>Freights from New York may have been reduced by the Pacific Mail
                            Steamship Company to the lowest remunerative point, but I am told by the
                            head of a leading German house here that he finds it much cheaper to buy
                            his American goods in New York and ship them to Hamburg by sail, and
                            send thence by sail around Gape Horn to San José, than to <pb
                                facs="0757" n="23" xml:id="pg_23"/> pay the steamer freights from
                            New York. He mentioned kerosene oil particularly.</p>
                        <p>As stated in my No. 588, dated March 5, 1877, there are a number of
                            European sailing-vessels that bring and carry goods and produce to and
                            from Central America.</p>
                        <p>6. The tariffs of the Central American States appear to be regulated
                            solely with the view of raising the largest amount of revenue, and
                            therefore, without regard to their effects, either upon the commerce of
                            the States or the convenience of their inhabitants. That of Guatemala
                            affords a notable illustration of the correctness of this statement, as
                            will be seen from the following data, taken from the official report of
                            July 10, 1877. That report shows that the duties collected upon the
                            articles written in the first column, whose values (as stated) are
                            placed in the second column, were as follows: <table cols="3" rows="20">

                        <p>It will be seen from the foregoing table bow obstructive to trade the
                            tariffs of some of these States are. You will also not fail to observe
                            that the duties levied upon flour, preserved or canned meats, fruits,
                            &amp;c., medicines, iron goods in different forms, petroleum, furniture,
                            and ready-made clothing, which our country has special advantages for
                            supplying cheaply, are out of all reasonable proportion to articles of
                            luxury, such as mirrors, toys, fine jewelry, perfumery, fancy goods, and
                            glassware, that chiefly are supplied from European markets. And when it
                            is considered that the merchant has to pay these high duties in cash
                            before he can take his goods out of the custom-house, and has to pay
                            freight at a high rate in advance, it is not difficult to see how few of
                            our young merchants are able to engage in commerce in Central America.
                            If, however, one should surmount those financial difficulties, he will
                            find that to compete with established houses he must sell his wares on
                            long time (say twelve months), and not send his bill to a customer until
                            it is asked for.</p>
                        <p>It is but just to remark that I feel perfectly confident the difference
                            in tariff-rates against articles imported from the United States does
                            not result from a disposition upon the part of the governments of these
                            states to discriminate in favor of European markets. All my influence
                            has been exerted to correct the difference, but my efforts have been
                            unsuccessful, principally (as I believe) because of the peculiar
                            character of the several governments, the want of any fixed national or
                            financial policy upon their part, and their continually pressing
                            pecuniary necessities. <pb facs="0758" n="24" xml:id="pg_24"/> To me it
                            appears the only remedy is to be found in commercial treaties based upon
                            the principle of reciprocity.</p>
                        <p>In November, 1875 (<hi rend="italic">vide</hi> my No. 457), I had this
                            honor to transmit to the Department translations of the tariffs of all
                            these States. It was a tedious and laborious work to make them, bat 1
                            fear it may have proved unsatisfactory, as I have not heard of them
                            since. The changes that have been made render them comparatively useless
                            now. The tariff rates of Guatemala have been nearly doubled, and an
                            export duty has been levied on coffee. The tariff of Salvador has been
                            completely remodeled so as to conform to that of Guatemala, according to
                            the treaty of 1876. That of Honduras has been wholly changed. That of
                            Nicaragua has been changed lately by the levying of a high export duty
                            on the principal products of that country for export. The tariff of
                            Costa Eica alone remains about the same.</p>
                        <p>7. Referring to that part of your circular desiring information “as to
                            the demand for different kinds of manufactured articles now used in the
                            Central American States, and whether they are of the character which it
                            is probable the industry of the United States can supply; also, as to
                            the products of the Central American States in which the trade with the
                            United States could be increased, either by legislation or executive
                            action or by commercial enterprise,” I beg leave to say that, although I
                            feel my incompetence to answer satisfactorily, I shall give you, as
                            clearly as I can, the results of my observations and inquiries since
                            coming here in 1873.</p>
                        <p>A former part of this dispatch conveys the opinion that, according to my
                            judgment, legislative and executive action is desirable for the purpose
                            of reorganizing the consular service in Central America, and I have also
                            attempted to point out how little American commercial enterprise has
                            made itself felt in this quarter. It is easy to write of such
                            generalities, but difficult without special training to give
                            satisfactory information as to the kind of goods best suited to these
                            markets, and the class of exports from these countries in which we may
                            increase our trade.</p>
                        <p>Following my, perhaps, incorrect idea of political economy, it seems to
                            me if we can succeed in inducing these people to make their purchases
                            principally in our markets, we may naturally expect them to ship us
                            their produce in payment; for it so happens their productions are of the
                            kind largely consumed in the United States. Their chief product for
                            export is coffee, and the only other article they can ever expect to
                            export largely is sugar. Cochineal and indigo are grown and exported
                            still, but the industry and capital engaged in that branch of
                            agriculture are fast finding their way into coffee estates. Cocoa is
                            also grown extensively in some localities, but owing to the delicacy of
                            the cocoa-tree and to its requiring low altitudes and moist climates for
                            its profitable cultivation, I do not believe that product is ever likely
                            to be grown to a sufficient extent in Central America to make its
                            exportation an item of sufficient value to take note of. The present
                            product of cocoa is scarcely sufficient for domestic consumption. We may
                            then take the general view of these States that they are to be
                            considered by the statesmen of our country as agricultural—producing
                            coffee and sugar—as non-manufacturing, and as non-producers, to any
                            considerable extent, of the wholesome and robust food of our more
                            temperate and favored country. Now, it so happens coffee and sugar are
                            consumed to an immense extent among our thrifty people, and their
                            consumption <hi rend="italic">per capita</hi> is likely to increase
                            rather than diminish.</p>
                        <p>According to the “Sugar Planter,” we consumed in the United States, in
                            1875,685,352 tons of sugar, of which we imported 621,852 tons. According
                                <pb facs="0759" n="25" xml:id="pg_25"/> to the Bureau of Statistics,
                            we imported in the commercial year 1876 sugar and molasses to the value
                            of $66,295,553.</p>
                        <p>Our importations of coffee for consumption amount, according to a
                            standard authority before me, to about three hundred millions of pounds
                            per annum. The report of the Bureau of Statistics states that in the
                            commercial year 1876 we imported coffee to the value of $56,788,997. It
                            appears we are the largest consumers of coffee in the world except the
                            people of Belgium, Holland, and Denmark. Our rate of consumption is
                            stated to be 7.61 pounds per capita. It is worthy of note in this
                            connection that, according to the Journal of Commerce of San Francisco,
                            out of the 9,849,913 pounds of coffee’ received in that city during the
                            year of 1876, Central America supplied 7,649,270 pounds. How to get from
                            these States articles we consume as largely as coffee and sugar, by
                            exporting the products of our industries instead of exporting coin, is a
                            problem whose solution is involved in the correct answer to the first
                            part of your inquiry already quoted.</p>
                        <p>By reference to Table No. 1, hereto attached, you will see the principal
                            articles that are imported into Guatemala from all countries. The same
                            list of principal articles of importation may be applied to all the
                            other States, for their importations are not dissimilar in kind. There
                            is not a single article on the list that could not be supplied by the
                            industries of our country. But the first step toward supplying them is
                            to reduce commissions and insurance to the European standard, and to
                            study the habits and taste and necessities of these people. Our cotton
                            goods are selling well among them, and the trade might be rapidly
                            increased, in my judgment, if a little more attention were paid to
                            lengths of pieces and styles of patterns of printed or colored goods.
                            Our machinery, sewing-machines, agricultural implements, medicines,
                            perfumery, soap, furniture, and many other articles are highly esteemed,
                            and some of them are extensively imitated by our European friends; but
                            when insurance and commission are double European rates, and interest is
                            higher, and credit is shorter, and packing is more costly and more
                            imperfect, we cannot reasonably expect to be patronized if our goods are
                            not much cheaper than those of other countries offering equal commercial
                            facilities at less expense.</p>
                        <p>There are many articles consumed in these countries which might be
                            manufactured by our countrymen and supplied at good profits, but to
                            enumerate them in detail would be too tedious, and I shall only say that
                            it seems to me we ought to be able to supply these people in a few years
                            with nearly every article that is made of cotton, or into whose
                            manufacture that staple largely enters. The same remark is applicable to
                            furniture, machinery, agricultural implements, pumps of different kinds,
                            and other products of our iron industries. As it would consume too much
                            of your time for. me to go into details on this branch of the subject, I
                            will say that I shall be happy to answer questions our merchants and
                            manufacturers may address me, or put them in correspondence with
                            reliable houses here that are strongly inclined to cultivate trade
                            relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>8. The tables annexed, numbered from 1 to 11, have been prepared with
                            great care, and I hope are correct. It is with pain that I notice that
                            my sum total of our trade with Central America differs so widely from
                            that given by so high an authority as the Bureau of Statistics. By my
                            report our total direct trade with Central America for last year is
                            $4,678,708.86. If to this be added the indirect trade given by the
                            Bureau of Statistics, $300,494, we shall have a total of direct and
                            indirect trade amounting to $4,989,202.86. The total reported by the <pb
                                facs="0760" n="26" xml:id="pg_26"/> Bureau of Statistics for the
                            year ending the 30th June, 1876,is $2,897,89L Without disputing the
                            correctness of that statement, I present you the data upon which mine
                            has been made up. It is to be observed that the periods covered by the
                            report of the bureau and by my report are not identical. That of the
                            former is for the year ending 30th June, 1876. My report for Guatemala
                            and Salvador covers the calendar year 1876; that of Honduras is for the
                            year ending 30th June, 1876; that of Nicaragua is for the year ending
                            30th September, 1876, and that of Costa Bica is for the year ending 30th
                            April, 1877. This difference of periods does not explain satisfactorily
                            the great difference in the totals. My data are as follows: The totals
                            of foreign commerce of Guatemala, Salvador, and Costa Rica are taken
                            from the published official reports of their respective governments; for
                            Honduras the published official report of Mr. Consul Frye, of Omoa and
                            Truxillo, and the private report to me of the agents of the Pacific Mail
                            Steamship Company at Amapala, have afforded the data for the total of
                            that state; for Nicaragua the total foreign commerce is made up from the
                            published report of Commercial Agent Sibell, of San Juan del Norte, and
                            the official report of the government of that country. The totals of our
                            trade with Guatemala and Salvador are taken from the official reports of
                            those states. The total of our trade with Honduras is made up from the
                            aforesaid report of Mr. Consul Frye and the report of the Pacific Mail
                            Steamship Company’s agent at Amapala. The total of our trade with Costa
                            Rica is made up by estimating our trade with that country as equal to
                            our trade with Salvador (about 15 per cent.), which I am quite sure is
                            not an overestimate, and our total trade with Nicaragua is made up from
                            the aforesaid report of Commercial Agent Sibell, and from an estimate of
                            our trade through the Pacific ports of Nicaragua, upon the same basis as
                            our trade with Salvador, an exclusively Pacific state. In my judgment
                            and according to.my information, the estimates are rather below than
                            above the mark. However, I do not claim accuracy in the data, for I am
                            conscious that in the official reports of the government of these
                            countries there is an evident tendency to overstate the amount of their
                            foreign commerce.</p>
                        <p>9. In this connection, and referring to that part of my No. 588, dated
                            5th March, 1877, in which it is stated “that under existing conditions
                            San Francisco enjoys advantages over any other city of the United States
                            as a base from which trade relations With these states may be promoted,”
                            I beg leave to call your attention to the difference between the
                            commerce of Central America through Caribbean (or so-called Atlantic)
                            ports and the ports on the Pacific.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your instruction of date July 16, 1877, marked “separate,”
                            and in reply to inform you that I have been unable to find in the
                            legation any documents of a late date which would give information upon
                            the subject of your communication.</p>
                        <p>It is cause for serious regret that the vast commerce which has
                            heretofore existed between the United States and South America has been
                            permitted to sink into comparative insignificance, and the means by
                            which it is to be revived is a subject demanding the most thoughtful
                            consideration. I need not assure you that the Department of State, in
                            its efforts in this direction, shall have my most cordial
                            co-operation.</p>
                        <p>Prior to 1861, I am informed, a majority of the merchant-vessels usually
                            in the harbor of Valparaiso carried the American flag. Not so now. In
                            fact, it is but seldom that the Stars and Stripes are seen floating over
                            a vessel in the South American ports. I am pleased to be able to say,
                            however, that they are much more frequently seen now than they were a
                            year ago, and I am confident that by proper effort the commerce of our
                            country with this may be vastly improved. To this end I am engaged in
                            the collection of some statistics, which I hope to be able, in
                            forwarding to the Department of State, to accompany with a few
                            suggestions not entirely void of interest or merit. Time, study, and
                            labor, however, are necessary to enable me to present the subject in a
                            manner satisfactory to myself, and I must ask the Department of State to
                            indulge me with a reasonable degree of patience.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: For further reply to your dispatch of date
                            July 13, ultimo, I herewith inclose an article taken from the Star and
                            Herald, of Panama, marked “Exhibit 1,” as showing the import into
                            Gautemala, one of the Central American States on the Pacific Coast,
                            whose trade by reason of her proximity to the United States should make
                            our ports her market for the articles mentioned. The article, and the
                            facts contained therein, are well worth the attention of our capitalists
                            engaged in exporting home products and merchandise.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me it would pay our merchant princes and exporters to <pb
                                facs="0766" n="32" xml:id="pg_32"/> see that agents are placed at
                            such ports where interest would seem to demand who would take more than
                            an ordinary interest in laying before the inspector at these points
                            samples of goods and articles of merchandise peculiar to our country,
                            for inspection, with prices and cost of delivery. If no better channel
                            could be adopted, why not require your consular and diplomatic officers
                            at their respective ports, other interests being considered, to act in
                            the premises?</p>
                        <p>I have made arrangements with the officials of the Panama Railroad and
                            other parties in possession of the facts, and at an early day hope to
                            lay the same before you for a similar statement to the one now
                            furnished, exhibiting all goods and merchandise in transit going to the
                            United States and other countries, that you may see at a glance the
                            immensity of this commerce and our disparagement in this comparison and
                            the advantage we have, and yet not availing ourselves of that
                            advantage.</p>
                        <p>Hoping, sir, I am not trespassing upon the license granted in replying to
                            your dispatch,</p>

                            <p>Our readers will find published below a statement of the imports of
                                the republic of Guatemala for 1876. From this it will be seen that
                                for the total represented by the original invoices, amounting to
                                $2,264,831.90, Great Britain furnishes about one-half, or
                                $1,125,150.31; France, one-fifth, or $449,537.38; Germany a little
                                more than one-eighth, or $264,288.25; and the United States only
                                about one-ninth, or $245,867.54.</p>
                            <p>In the statement showing the classification of imported goods,
                                manufactured cotton takes the lead, at $1,006,538.71, followed by
                                woolen goods, $281,247.32; silks, $112,592.35; haberdashery,
                                $80,469.05; linen goods, $67,233.11; boots and shoes, $52,845.37;
                                wine, $52,652.81; flour, $51,398.50; machinery, $48,486.97; hats,
                                $44,674.28; and so on through a list embracing fifty-three classes
                                of articles, the smallest of which is exotic seeds and plants,
                                $236.19. It will be well for our American mercantile friends to
                                study this statement. From it they will learn how insignificant an
                                amount of the total foreign supplies furnished, come from the United
                                States, and may be incited to make a more determined effort to
                                secure a larger share of the growing trade of the leading Central
                                American State. In the matter of cotton and woolen goods especially,
                                which amount in value to more than one-half the entire import, there
                                is no reason why Guatemala should continue to look to Europe for her
                                supplies, while in nearly every other article on the list, American
                                manufacturers should be able to compete successfully with those on
                                the other side of the Atlantic. In a few years, at the present rate
                                of improvement, Central America will furnish a market for tens of
                                millions worth of foreign goods, which should naturally he derived
                                from the Great Republic of the North, and Will be without doubt, if
                                the necessary efforts are made on the part of those most interested.
                                Then instead of furnishing the pitiful sartorial fraction of
                                one-ninth, the United States will be able to head the list.</p>

                            by examination and inquiry to enable myself to point out branches of
                            trade with Denmark in which the United States may profitably and
                            usefully share, I have now the honor, after having thus far devoted
                            considerable time and attention to the examination of this question, to
                            communicate to you the following statements and observations as some of

                            <item>Denmark proper is situated in the northern part of Europe, between
                                53° and 58° north latitude, and 7° and 13° east longitude, and
                                consists of the peninsula of Jutland, the islands of Sealand,

                                other smaller ones, having a total population of about 1,874,000
                                inhabitants. It is therefore evident that the smallness of the
                                kingdom and the nature of its territory, form no small obstacles in
                                the way of the development of an extensive commerce between it and
                                the United States.</item>

                            <item>The utter lack of a regular line of steamships or sailing vessels

                            <item>Denmark is not much of a manufacturing country. The raw materials
                                for the comparatively few factories it possesses are either produced
                                at home or imported from England, France, Germany, and Sweden. So,
                                too, are most of the different manufactured articles in use. <pb
                                    facs="0768" n="34" xml:id="pg_34"/> The prices of the different
                                kinds of raw material in the manufacturing districts of these
                                countries being nearly, if not quite, as low as, and labor cheaper,
                                than in the United States, and the cost of transportation from the
                                former countries far less than from the latter, it becomes evident
                                that comparatively few manufactured articles from the United States
                                can find a profitable market in Denmark. Besides, the Danes are slow
                                in introducing innovations, they being generally satisfied with
                                articles manufactured in their own country, so far as they reach,
                                and if they possess a special sympathy for any foreign country and
                                special predilections for foreign articles, it is for France and
                                French articles.</item>

                            <item>Denmark is principally an agricultural country. Besides the
                                ordinary garden vegetables, its agricultural products are
                                principally wheat, rye, barley, oats, buckwheat, peas, beans,
                                potatoes, beets, hay, &amp;c. A large quantity of these products,
                                together with cattle, sheep, hogs, poultry, &amp;c., are exported to
                                England and Germany, thus showing that of these articles more than
                                enough are raised for home consumption, and that Denmark furnishes
                                no market for American breadstuffs. Corn and corn-meal form,
                                perhaps, the only exceptions.</item>

                            <item>With the exception of salt, chalk, freestone, pottery, and
                                porcelain clays, no other mineral products of any great value are
                                found in Denmark. Nor are any metals found. Iron and steel and
                                manufactured articles thereof are imported from Sweden and England.
                                The former country being so near to Denmark, and producing large
                                quantities of these metals, both raw and wrought, supplies almost
                                the entire Danish market therewith, in these articles, therefore,
                                the United States cannot successfully compete with Sweden and
                                England in the Danish market, on account, principally, of the
                                greater distance and consequent increase in the cost of
                                transportation.</item>

                            <item>The same is pretty much true of coal. Almost all, if not all, the
                                coal consumed in Denmark is imported from England. Sweden produces
                                little or none; hence none can be derived from that country. The
                                prices of coal of good quality in Newcastle, England, and in
                                Baltimore and New York are now nearly, if not entirely, equal. There
                                can be no doubt that at no distant day the price of American coal
                                will be lower than that of English coal. The difficulty, however, of
                                supplying the Danish market with American coal lies chiefly in the
                                distance and the consequent increase of the cost of
                                transportation.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>If American sailing-vessels receiving coal either at Baltimore or New
                            York directly from the railway-cars and carrying it directly to Denmark,
                            could find a return cargo, or if European vessels in the ports of
                            Baltimore or New York finding no cargo would carry coal, instead of
                            ballast, the experiment might be made of supplying the Danish market
                            with American coal.</p>
                        <p>I have been informed that already a large amount of the coal-trade from
                            Cardiff and Liverpool to the East and West Indies and South America has
                            been transferred to Baltimore as the result of a large advance in the
                            price of coal in England, and a continued and heavy increase of foreign
                            export of coal is looked for by parties in Baltimore. I would suggest
                            that one or more American coal-companies that have sufficient capacity
                            and facilities for economically shipping coal to the seaboard—such as
                            the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, or railroad companies whose
                            roads terminate in Jersey City—take this subject into consideration, and
                            send an agent to this city for the purpose of maturing a plan by which
                            the Danish market may be supplied with American coal.</p>

                        <p>1. As regards the coal-trade I have already suggested a method. As
                            regards the methods for enlarging the trade and commerce between the
                            United States and Denmark in other articles, the following suggestions
                            are offered:</p>
                        <p>2. The establishment of a monthly or semi-monthly line of steamers or
                            sailing-vessels appears to me to be an indispensable condition for the
                            development and enlargement of the trade and commerce between the United
                            States and Denmark. This line might also embrace the ports of the
                            southern and southeastern coasts of the Baltic Sea, as well as those in
                            the west and south of Sweden. There can be no doubt that the existence
                            of such a line connected with a proper amount of commercial enterprise
                            on the part of some American merchants, would tend to largely increase
                            the trade and commerce between the United States and Denmark and the
                            districts along the Baltic coasts in which the ports just mentioned are
                            situated. The import into Denmark and these districts, of American
                            articles of merchandise not produced there, would thereby be greatly
                            facilitated and cheapened.</p>
                        <p>3. Another method for developing and enlarging the trade and commerce
                            between the United States and Denmark is, in my opinion, the
                            establishment, say, at Copenhagen, of a central depot, managed by
                            capable, enterprising, and trustworthy parties, where a supply is kept
                            on hand not only of such articles as are now imported from the United
                            States, but also of such other articles as are largely consumed but not
                            produced in Denmark.</p>
                        <p>Some of the principal articles imported from the United States are: 1,
                            petroleum; 2, corn (maize); 3, lard; 4, bacon; 5, butter and cheese; 6,
                            agricultural and other machines. During the year 1876 there were
                            imported from the United States of petroleum, 40,000 barrels, valued at
                            1,600,000 Danish crowns (about $432,000, gold); of corn (maize), 230,000
                            tönder (about 920,000 bushels), valued at 3,680,000 crowns (about
                            $993,600, gold); of lard, 7,000 barrels, valued at 910,000 crowns (about
                            $245,700, gold); of bacon, 3,000 boxes, valued at 540,000 crowns
                            ($145,800, gold).</p>
                        <p>The statistics of the quantity and value of butter and cheese and of the
                            number and value of agricultural and other machines imported from the
                            United States I have not been able to obtain. American cheese is here
                            well liked and much sought after. The quality of the butter imported
                            from the United States, however, is not as good as that of the Danish
                            butter, though it has commenced to be a rival of the latter. Danish
                            butter has a good reputation all over the world; and if our American
                            dairymen understood the secret of preparing and packing butter for
                            export as well as the Danish dairymen, they would be able to command not
                            only the Danish butter market, but that of almost every other country.
                            Why cannot a number of persons be sent here for the purpose of learning
                            that secret by practice, or, rather, why not send for a number of Danish
                            experts in this branch to teach American dairymen that secret? The
                            increased expenses incurred thereby would in the end be far more than
                            counterbalanced by the increased butter export and the profits yielded
                            by it.</p>
                        <p>4. By a little more enterprise the importation of cheese from the United
                            States could also be increased. The same is true of agricultural
                            implements and machines, sewing and knitting machines, mechanics tools
                            and instruments, leather, cotton, and linen goods, tobacco in leaves,
                            sugar, refined and unrefined, sirup and molasses, &amp;c. I would
                            suggest <pb facs="0770" n="36" xml:id="pg_36"/> that the producers and
                            manufacturers of these various articles in the United States employ an
                            enterprising and trustworthy agent whose business it should be to study
                            the prices of and import duty on the articles mentioned, and, being
                            supplied with a sufficient number of samples, to travel throughout the
                            country for the purpose of procuring orders therefor.</p>
                        <p>I have, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your circular dated August 15, 1877, referring to the
                            importance of consular officers exerting themselves to promote the best
                            interests of trade between their consular districts and the United
                            States. In reply thereto, I have the honor to state that since my
                            induction into office here I have felt the importance of such an effort,
                            and have therefore been constantly at work to induce shipments of our
                            surplus products into my consular district, such as hides, hog-products,
                            cotton, corn, &amp;c. This latter article has shown the most marked
                            increase.</p>
                        <p>From the best information I get there were received in 1875, for the
                            first time, at this port a few samples of American Indian corn, giving
                            rise to importations direct from the United States in 1876 of 2,591,600
                            pounds. During the past seven months of the present year, importations
                            from our country to Havre have increased to 28,936,088 pounds, showing,
                            as you will see, an increase in direct shipments of eleven-fold.</p>
                        <p>Knowing that we have a large surplus at home, and that with a proper I
                            foreign demand we could produce an almost unlimited quantity of this
                            grain, I more than two years ago visited the superintendent of the
                            street railroad company and several of the largest livery and truck
                            stables, whom I induced to try our Indian corn as a feed in place of
                            oats, wheat, and barley, as has been their custom, by showing them it
                            would be greatly to their advantage, as it would cost them only
                            two-thirds of the value of the grain they were then feeding.</p>
                        <p>For two years these people have been feeding almost exclusively Indian
                            corn, by grinding it and mixing it with cut feed, as well as by boiling,
                            and feeding of it in hominy state. The farmers in this consular district
                            have also adopted this feed to a considerable extent, and are gelling
                            their small grain which hitherto they have been in the habit of feeding
                            to their own stock, thereby saving fully 33 per cent. French distillers
                            are now beginning to make use of this great American staple.</p>
                        <p>There has been a gradual increase in the receipts at this port from the
                            United States of nearly all of the aforenamed articles, as you will see
                            by referring to my annual reports, notwithstanding the prostration of
                            trade nearly all over the world during the past three years. The
                            increase in the receipts of Indian corn, however, is by far the most
                            marked. We have had several ships from New Orleans this summer with
                            corn, which arrived here in good condition, having been well handled by
                            elevators <pb facs="0771" n="37" xml:id="pg_37"/> in New Orleans before
                            shipment, which proves how easy it is to ship it from our Northern ports
                            without the risk of damage by souring. This new feature in exports from
                            New Orleans is of great importance to that city and the Mississippi
                            Valley, as it is cheaper to float property downstream than to move it by
                            railroad to New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to bring to your notice a few facts
                            which relate to the trade between Martinique and the United States, and
                            to state the means by which export of several articles from the United
                            States to Martinique might, in my opinion, be increased.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">steam coal.</hi></p>
                        <p>There are about 50,000 to 60,000 tons of coal imported to this island per
                            annum, of which the French Transatlantic Steamship Company uses from
                            30,000 to 40,000 tons per annum. This coal has been imported from Europe
                            previous to this year, but in January last I sent a circular (which I
                            had received from a Philadelphia coal company) to the agent of the
                            steamship company at Fort de France, and in a short time he ordered a
                            small cargo of coal for trial; but, on not finding it sufficient, he
                            ordered 1,000 tons more, and he informed me a short time since that he
                            liked the coal so well that he had ordered about 10,000 tons more. I am,
                            therefore, led to believe (as this branch of trade has been fairly
                            started) that it will continue to increase.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">furniture.</hi></p>
                        <p>There has been formerly imported to this island a small amount of
                            American furniture, which is much cheaper than any made here, and in my
                            opinion is better styled than the French furniture, owing to which facts
                            two more firms have commenced importing American furniture largely
                            during the past year, to whom I have given all the information that I
                            could on the subject.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">agricultural implements.</hi></p>
                        <p>Formerly articles of this description have been mostly imported from
                            France, but lately quite an amount has been imported from the United
                            States, and which on being used have been much liked, owing perhaps
                            partly to the fact that they are cheaper than those of French
                            manufacture.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">carriages.</hi></p>
                        <p>Ten years since there was scarcely a carriage in Martinique; but since
                            the number of them has been constantly increasing, and for the <pb
                                facs="0772" n="38" xml:id="pg_38"/> past two years the number of
                            carriages imported has been nearly doubled, and at present a large
                            number of merchants (and many others) keep a carriage. Nearly all the
                            carriages in Martinique are of American manufacture; in fact there are a
                            very few French carriages in use.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">cotton goods</hi>.</p>
                        <p>This branch of business should (in my opinion) be carried on with the
                            United States, for, if I am correctly informed, this class of goods can
                            be obtained cheaper in the United States than in France, although I am
                            not well posted on this subject. A few months ago a gentleman from
                            Dominica informed me that one year since he had ordered from the United
                            States £500 sterling worth of cotton goods as a trial, and that he got
                            them cheaper than he could have in England, but it took a long time—four
                            or five months—to obtain them, and that the freight was much more than
                            it would have been from England, and that from England he could have
                            obtained them in six weeks.</p>
                        <p>The prejudices of the people of this island against articles of American
                            manufacture are to some extent (and steadily) being overcome.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">means of communication</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The means of communication between Martinique and the United States are
                            very bad. Passengers to and from the United States have to go via Saint
                            Thomas and Havana, or Saint Thomas, Bermuda, and Halifax, with a fair
                            prospect of the steamers not connecting (and which is very expensive) or
                            by sailing-vessels, which is very tedious, as it takes a long time—say
                            fifteen to thirty days. The most convenient mode of communication with
                            the United States is by sailing-vessel for mail or passengers. Since
                            February, 1876, there has been but one merchant who has gone to the
                            United States (inclosed please find a list of the cargo which he bought
                            while there), while nearly all of the leading merchants go to France
                            once a year. An answer to a letter to France can be obtained in one
                            month and four days, whereas it takes about three months to obtain an
                            answer to a letter to the United States, which is a very great
                            disadvantage to trade between Martinique and the United States, as
                            telegraphic communication is too expensive to be used on all
                            occasions.</p>
                        <p>Steam communication between Martinique, Guadaloupe, and the United States
                            is badly wanted, and would be the means of greatly increasing the trade
                            of the United States with the Windward West India Islands, for which we
                            think there is ample room, but to do which a quicker and more certain
                            means of communication than any in existence must be had, or, in other
                            words, <hi rend="italic">steamships.</hi></p>
                        <p>If there could be two steamships (of about one thousand tons each) come
                            here semi monthly, touching at Point-a-Pitre, Guadaloupe, it would
                            greatly help American commerce, as passengers, freight, and mail from
                            Trinidad, Grenada, Sta. Lucía, St. Vincent, Barbadoes, and Dominica for
                            the United States would center here, as there are small sailing packets
                            constantly running between all of these islands and Martinique, and a
                            large number of passengers come from these islands (at present) to
                            obtain a passage to the United States. Sailing-vessels can generally lay
                            their course to the southern end of Barbadoes, it being southeast, and
                            the wind being generally east-northeast, but sometimes they have to make
                            one or two tacks, and these vessels can generally lay their courses to
                            and from the other above-mentioned islands. The passengers, mail, and
                                <pb facs="0773" n="39" xml:id="pg_39"/> freight coining to
                            Point-a-Pitre, Guadaloupe, for shipping would be from St. Christopher,
                            Montserrat, Nevis, Antigua, St. Bartholomew, St. Martin, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Fort de France, Martinique, is one of the best harbors, and has the best
                            dry-dock in the West Indies, and the large steamers of the French
                            Transatlantic Steamship Company take in coal while lying at the
                            wharf.</p>
                        <p>Sugar is manufactured here the year around, so that if there was no other
                            freight a sugar freight for a steamer of a small size could be obtained
                            at almost any time for the United States.</p>
                        <p>One other advantage would appear to be, that merchants would go to the
                            United States, and while there would buy many articles which are now
                            obtained from France, as you can see what this one merchant (before
                            mentioned) bought by going himself; and again if small lots of goods
                            were ordered they would come by steamers, and by so doing save time, as
                            those who ship cargoes by sailing-vessels do not like to take freight
                            from other parties who would ship by steamer at less rates, as she would
                            bring freight for any one. I believe that, if our government would pay
                            liberally for carrying the United States mail between here, touching at
                            Point-a-Pitre, Guadaloupe, and the United States, the Government of
                            Martinique would also be liberal, as I have talked with a number of
                            persons on this subject, and probably the Government of Guadaloupe would
                            do something as well, if it were rightly managed and made to appear to
                            them that they would be gainers by the project.</p>
                        <p>In case that these benefits were offered I think that there would be no
                            difficulty in finding parties who would be willing to run the
                            steamers.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Recurring to my report No. 277, under date
                            of 18th September last, relating to the “trade” circular of the
                            Department, I will, with your leave, proceed to give a list of articles
                            which from a thorough examination of the subject I am led to believe may
                            be profitably and extensively introduced into Germany; adding some
                            general observations on the manner and mode of shipping their goods,
                            which it is desirable for American exporters to observe.</p>
                        <p>All articles known in our markets as fine castings, either bronzed or
                            maroon-colored and Japanned, are in decided demand here. So are such
                            notions as mouse and rat traps of all kinds. Of tools, American
                            breast-drills, wrenches of all kinds, saws, especially Diston’s circular
                            saws, find a ready sale, the latter notwithstanding the fact that they
                            are higher in price than the domestic article of the same character.
                            American handsaws, owing to their shape, are not at all used here.
                            Back-saws and panel-saws of American make, although of most excellent
                            quality and fitness, range too high in price, and those of French make
                            control the market. Likewise draw-saws, drawing-knives, chisels, and
                            gouges are too dear for this market, English goods of this description
                            take precedence. Butchers’ saws are in considerable demand; so also
                            try-saws, trowels, plumbs, and levels are found very good and very
                            cheap, and sell largely. American augers and auger-bits are also much
                            liked, and, although rather dearer than the domestic articles, will find
                            a good market. Wooden planes of American make are very cheap in
                            comparison with the home made ones, but to insure their sale their
                            present form must be changed to suit the German notions. Iron planes
                            will also sell well. American plane-irons are too dear as compared with
                            the English ones. American coopers’ tools find no sale, not being in
                            conformity with the forms and shapes in use here.</p>
                        <p>Wrought iron hinges are pronounced an excellent article, but are too <pb
                                facs="0775" n="41" xml:id="pg_41"/> high in price as yet to obtain
                            an extensive sale. Cast iron hinges find no sale at all here; for
                            door-bolts of all kinds and cast-iron stable-fittings of all kinds, as
                            made in America, there is much demand. American hammers of good quality
                            are too dear for the German market. American scythes, if made to conform
                            to the German shape, would also find a favorable market. American
                            shovels of all kinds are in demand, and may be imported with advantage.
                            The same is the case also as regards all kinds of hickory handles, and
                            of chisel, file, auger, and other like handles. Sadirons of all kinds
                            are gradually finding their way into this market. American cut tacks and
                            nails are not yet used here, but a demand is arising for machinery for
                            manufacturing them. American boiler-rivets are too dear; but our
                            padlocks of all kinds, on account of their quality and price, will find
                            a large and ready sale. There is also a fair chance for trade in such
                            articles as box-scrapers, can-openers, gas-plyers, mincing-knives,
                            saw-sets, and the like.</p>
                        <p>A fine market offers also for American oil-stones and grindstones. All
                            kinds of American agricultural implements have long enjoyed a fine
                            market, but it is to be regretted that recently very many articles of an
                            inferior quality have been sent here which are calculated to exercise a
                            very injurious effect. For cheap American furniture, particularly
                            chamber-sets, an extensive market can be secured by proper efforts. As
                            additional articles which are gradually gaining ground may be mentioned
                            American wind-mills, ventilators, and steam-pumps, gas-fittings of all
                            kinds, hickory wheels, spokes, rims for wheels and wagon-shafts known at
                            home as bent-work; American toys, owing to their ingenuity and
                            durability; portable steam-engines of from two to ten horse power;
                            American wood-working machinery, cheap metal clocks; further, all kinds
                            of housekeeping and kitchen articles, especially when novelties; also,
                            American shoe brushes—while horse-brushes, although well made, are too
                            dear. American curry-combs are generally too light for the German
                            market. For American sewing-machines all demand has ceased. As regards
                            American leather and boots and shoes, I beg to refer to my reports Nos.
                            276 and 280. Mention may finally also be made of our excellent pressed
                            glasswares as offering a prospect of fair and profitable sale. The
                            American manufactures now best known in Germany are those of the Eastern
                            States, especially Massachusetts and Connecticut; of the Middle States,
                            those of Pennsylvania. A reason for the fact that our Western
                            manufactures are known here in but a slight degree may, perhaps, be
                            found in the habit of Western manufacturers of quoting their goods, in
                            answer of German importers’ questions as to prices, &amp;c., “free on
                            board the cars at the place of their factories”. The German merchant,
                            being in no position to even guess at the cost of transportation from
                            such factories to the seaboard, fails to give attention to such
                            quotations. In all cases it is essential for American manufacturers to
                            give, in answer to questions for prices, the weight as well as bulk of
                            their goods, so that the German importer may be enabled to calculate not
                            only the sea-freight, which is by bulk, but also the duty and railroad
                            freight in this country, which is by weight. Considerable fault is found
                            here with American exporters on account of the want of care which it is
                            alleged they observe in packing their goods. It not unfrequently occurs
                            that a machine is sent with some little screw or wrench missing, which
                            it is impossible to replace except from America, thereby rendering the
                            machine for the time being useless. It is also held here that it would
                            be better that goods sent here should be packed in crates and not in
                            cases, the former mode affording better protection against breakage. <pb
                                facs="0776" n="42" xml:id="pg_42"/> All eases of American goods
                            shipped to Europe should be numbered and bear also the initials of the
                            senders, otherwise the receiver to whom goods may be consigned on the
                            same vessel, from more than one sender, may be at a loss to properly
                            distinguish cases bearing the same numbers, and thereby be greatly
                            embarrassed respecting the declarations he is required to make in
                            entering the goods at the customhouses.</p>
                        <p>Hoping I may have succeeded in the foregoing statement in meeting the
                            intentions of the Department, as expressed in the recent trade-circular,
                            and promising further reports upon the subject as the information
                            gathered may warrant them,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In response to the instructions contained
                            in your circular of August last, concerning the development of trade
                            between the United States and foreign countries, I have the honor to
                            report as follows:</p>
                        <p>Within the past few years, in this district, a great interest in American
                            manufactures has been developed; and especially since the Philadelphia
                            Exhibition has the reputation of our products acquired such prominence
                            and been so favorably sustained and noised abroad by the intelligent
                            Germans who visited the exhibition, that a demand has arisen for them to
                            such an extent as to compel the serious attention of those who supply
                            the wants of the public. Although the Germans resist innovations upon
                            the manners and usages to which they have been for so long a time
                            accustomed, and while they are slow to accept novelties and distrustful
                            of all foreign importations, being strongly prejudiced in favor of their
                            own productions, et the opportunities, though few, that have lately been
                            afforded them of examining and acquiring a knowledge of American
                            products have created a very spirited inquiry and demand on the part of
                            consumers which the merchants must satisfy. For instance,
                            hardware-dealers find it necessary to keep in stock tools and implements
                            of American make, because they are considered the best and most durable;
                            in stationery stores are to be found American gold pens, fancy table
                            cards, much superior to those made here, paper-weights, twine-holders,
                            pen-racks, letter and bill files, and other practical articles for the
                            use of merchants, which are made so cheaply and tastily in America that
                            large quantities are sold here; shirt-dealers are compelled to provide
                            American shirting cotton to meet the wishes of their customers; and I
                            was recently informed by one of the largest dealers in fancy goods and
                            notions in this city, whose stock is gathered from all parts of the
                            world, that he considered American silver-plated ware as the best, and
                            sold it as such, and that his sales of American articles were constantly
                            increasing. Indeed, one often hears, from men of good judgment, the
                            opinion that all American productions are so practical, tasty, good, and
                            cheap that they must come into general use, and that were it not for the
                                <pb facs="0777" n="43" xml:id="pg_43"/> obstacles presented by our
                            tariff (greater in some places than in others), they would soon be
                            introduced into all countries. In this city enterprising
                            commission-houses are seeking connections with American manufacturers in
                            all branches for supplies of their products, believing that in the near
                            future a good business can be established. One house here, long engaged
                            in the sale of American oil cloth, has added recently to their stock
                            American paper-hangings, which are made by us much better and with far
                            more taste than in this country, and they are now bringing over samples
                            of prints, cotton sheetings and shirtings, also medium carpets, which
                            they hope successfully to introduce.</p>
                        <p>Silver-plated goods are so generally used, and those made in America are
                            so far superior in composition, finish, beauty, and strength to those
                            made in this country, that, with proper presentation, there can be no
                            doubt of their successful introduction. Merchants with whom I have
                            conversed say that it will go slow at first, and that the manufacturers
                            must be very particular with the goods sent over to this market in order
                            to protect their reputation and secure confidence, but that from the
                            present outlook the successful introduction of American goods into this
                            country must be admitted.</p>
                        <p>It is highly important that our manufacturers should select
                            well-established and favorably-known houses to act as their agents, as
                            well to obtain the confidence of the public as for their own security.
                            Applications for consignments or samples from houses without reputation
                            or indorsement should be rejected.</p>
                        <p>I would call attention to the great advantages afforded by the spring and
                            fall fairs held in this city for the introduction of new products into
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>Leipsic is the commercial center of Saxony, and one of the great trading
                            centers of Europe. Each spring and fall a great fair is held, to which
                            buyers from all parts of the world are congregated in very large
                            numbers. They remain from one to two weeks solely for the purpose of
                            seeking out, examining, and purchasing the products of the factories
                            from all the German States, as well as what may be presented from other
                            countries. I would suggest, as a good plan, to send a line of samples to
                            meet the opening of one of these fairs (especially the spring fair,
                            which is the largest and best attended) under the charge of a man who
                            thoroughly understands the manufacture of the goods, one who has a good
                            stock of patience, and who will adapt himself to the peculiarities of
                            the people with whom he will be brought into contact. A knowledge of the
                            language is very desirable in so far that inquiries, descriptions, and
                            explanations are much more satisfactory to both parties when given
                            direct than when an interpreter has to be used.</p>
                        <p>It will be seen at a glance that, by such an opportunity as above
                            mentioned, an agent could cover more ground and show his wares to more
                            persons from various parts of the country in a few days than he could by
                            weeks of travel. He could learn what styles and designs are required by
                            the different markets he wishes to supply, could select agents in such
                            places as he considered most suitable, and if he found sufficient
                            encouragement might establish a depot for his wares.</p>
                        <p>Since the Leipsic fairs have about lost all interest for American buyers,
                            except, probably, in the one article of furs, I would be pleased to see
                            them utilized by our manufacturers for the introduction of American
                            products.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The consular district of Chemnitz has a
                            population of about 420 to the square mile—in all, nearly one million.
                            In a country so densely populated there must necessarily be many
                            manufactories, as is the case here. Almost every variety of goods is
                            produced in Saxony, and perhaps four-fifths of the people earn their
                            living by manual labor. In a country where there are so many laborers
                            wages are usually very low; hence this country is noted for its cheap
                            labor as well as for its cheap goods. It is the cheap labor of this
                            district alone which enables the manufacturers to place their goods in
                            other markets at competitive prices. Southern Saxony is not
                            self-supporting unless foreign markets can be found for a large
                            percentage of the goods which are there produced. Necessity has made the
                            manufacturers of this district very energetic in seeking customers from
                            abroad. The cheapness of Saxon goods, coupled with our wants and avidity
                            to purchase anything that is foreign, has enabled Saxony, so far, to
                            sell to the United States about three-fourths of her exports, the goods
                            shipped from this district alone to our country being of the value of
                            about $4,000,000 annually.</p>
                        <p>In this part of Saxony the manufacturers are fully aware of the
                            importance, to them, of our trade. They have endeavored to ascertain our
                            wants, some of them visiting Philadelphia last year principally for that
                            purpose. Notwithstanding we patronize them as liberally as we do,
                            scarcely a day passes but that I hear our import laws bitterly
                            denounced, because, by them, our ports are virtually closed to many
                            classes of their goods, which we cannot now afford to buy. I am
                            convinced that, without a general brightening up of trade or a
                            modification of our tariff laws, the trade of our country with this
                            district cannot be materially increased.</p>
                        <p>To increase the exportation of our goods to Saxony will be no easy
                            undertaking. Unlike our people, the citizens of this country are slow to
                            adopt foreign ideas, and it is very difficult to induce them to purchase
                            foreign goods, especially when they have anything of their own
                            manufacture which will answer their purpose. Once accustomed to the use
                            of an article, they are loath to buy anything new. The country people of
                            this district still hitch a horse to the side of a pole and drive with a
                            single or jerk-line, persistently refusing to change to shafts and
                            double lines. Even in this city of nearly one hundred thousand
                            inhabitants the cab drivers would not lay aside the pole and single line
                            until they were compelled to do so by the city authorities. Adherence to
                            established customs marks the people of this district in almost
                            everything they use or do, and their actions are no more regulated by
                            habit than their purchases are by use. A large majority of the people
                            feel that they are too poor to purchase new articles in order to
                            ascertain their merit, and therefore they only buy such goods as they
                            have used, or have seen others use, thereby avoiding the risk of an
                            experiment.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the obstacles which must be overcome in order to increase
                            our trade in this district, there are many articles which our merchants
                            could profitably sell here, provided proper steps were taken to
                            introduce them.</p>
                        <p>I instance three classes of American goods which are not, but which might
                            be, sold in this district to good advantage, viz: First, articles <pb
                                facs="0779" n="45" xml:id="pg_45"/> which we produce, but which
                            Saxony does not; second, articles which we can sell cheaper than they
                            can be produced here; and, third, articles of American manufacture which
                            are superior to those produced in this country. The first class of goods
                            it would not be very difficult to introduce; the second would probably
                            sell, to a limited extent, as soon as placed upon the market; but the
                            third could only be sold by patience and perseverance, unless they were
                            much cheaper than those produced in this country.</p>
                        <p>The following are some of the articles which, I think, might profitably
                            be sold here. First class: all kinds of wooden ware, fellies, hubs, and
                            spokes for wagons, ax-helves, mechanical tools, spun cotton, muslins,
                            calicoes, dried apples and peaches, baking-powder, and various kinds of
                            canned fruits. Second class: lard, all kinds of cured meats, and (during
                            a portion of the year) butter. Third class: plows, wagons, harness,
                            harness-mountings, axes, hoes, shovels, reapers and mowers, and various
                            other kinds of machinery, carriages, and especially merchant-scales and
                            cooking-stoves.</p>
                        <p>Some of the articles named may now be found in this market, but they are
                            few in number, and no effort is made to sell them.</p>
                        <p>Any person who has lived in this country will say that to sell certain
                            kinds of American goods in the German markets would be an advantage to
                            both countries; but the difficult question to determine is, “How shall
                            they be introduced so the people will buy them?” It will not do to place
                            our goods in the hands of merchants here who handle like articles of
                            German manufacture, as such persons will usually make but little
                            exertion to sell foreign articles, but will content themselves with
                            disposing of those with which the people are acquainted, and which will
                            consequently readily sell.</p>
                        <p>The American goods Which are now on the shelves of the merchants of this
                            city are unadvertised, and consequently not called for.</p>
                        <p>The plan for increasing our trade with this country which, it seems to
                            me, might be adopted with the least outlay and best results, is for a
                            number of our merchants to secure a large wareroom in Bremen or Hamburg,
                            and in it store such goods as it is desired to sell. Let agents be
                            secured in the larger cities to sell such goods <hi rend="italic"
                                >only</hi> as should be furnished them from the general store-room.
                            Their supplies being so near at hand they would need but a small stock
                            to commence business with. By advertising and industry they should soon
                            be able to build up a very fair business.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to separate Department dispatch
                            dated August, 1877, I beg to submit some preliminary observations
                            germane to the subjects referred to in that dispatch.</p>
                        <p>The present is in many respects a peculiarly favorable time for the
                            introduction and sale of American productions in this part of Germany,
                            The existing plethora of coin, the languishing state of skilled
                            production, <pb facs="0780" n="46" xml:id="pg_46"/> and the low rates of
                            duty now established, conspire to invite the American producer to find
                            here a profitable market. At the same time, in pursuing this result, he
                            is obliged to encounter serious obstacles, and one of these is the
                            prevailing feeling that the American tariff system is not sufficiently
                            liberal toward the German producer; that there should be greater
                            reciprocity of commercial advantages between the two countries, and
                            that, if we would extend our trade in Germany, we should reduce the
                            legal obstacles to a like extension of German trade in our own country.
                            This feeling, whether just or not, has become widely diffused among the
                            purchasing classes, and is the occasion of much jealousy and coldness
                            toward efforts to increase the sale of American productions.</p>
                        <p>Another difficulty is the strong attachment of the German people for
                            their fixed customs, and their disinclination to adopt innovations,
                            especially those of foreign origin. The more extensive introduction and
                            sale of many articles of American production, for which there might
                            appear to be a very large field here, implies an essential change in
                            habits and ways of doing things which have lasted perhaps for
                            generations, and which will not be abandoned except for very strong and
                            obvious reasons.</p>
                        <p>At a future time I hope to lay before the Department the results of an
                            investigation I am now making as to the existing prices, demand, and
                            opportunities for the sale of various articles which can be supplied by
                            American industry, and with respect to the products of this part of
                            Germany in which the trade of the United States may be increased. At
                            present I only wish to offer some general suggestions as to the best
                            means of promoting our commercial interests in this field, having
                            special reference to the difficulties already mentioned which stand in
                            the way of this desirable end.</p>
                        <p>As to the prejudices arising from the present tariff regulations of our
                            country, I have to say that, while they amount to an obstacle in the way
                            of extending our trade, they will readily yield to superior motives of
                            pecuniary interest. The Germans, like other people, will buy where and
                            of whom they can buy the cheapest, only provided they shall be convinced
                            that the articles offered them are the cheapest. To carry such
                            convictions, our producers must pursue substantially the same processes
                            as in America, except, perhaps, that more effort is required owing to
                            the peculiar difficulties to be overcome. They must advertise their
                            wares, exhibit them, and submit them to trial. They must solicit sales,
                            either in person or by responsible agents, who have the sagacity to
                            avail themselves of opportunities to sell, and who have the necessary
                            integrity and financial reliability to win the confidence of the people.
                            A mere margin of difference in commercial values will scarcely, of
                            itself, introduce or extend any branch of trade unless it shall be
                            supplemented and pursued by active business enterprise.</p>
                        <p>To no European country, as I believe, do these observations apply with
                            more force than to this. The large German population in America somewhat
                            predisposes the people of Germany to more intimate commercial relations
                            with the United States, and to a favorable opinion of American
                            productions. But, at the same time, the German people are naturally
                            cautious and conservative with reference to commercial ventures, and
                            they must see and thoroughly try our wares before they will extensively
                            buy them. An implement that has been in use for a hundred years, awkward
                            and inefficient though it may be, will not be suddenly laid aside for a
                            new one, however superior. There must first be a fair chance for
                            comparing the merits of toe two and for ascertaining the superiority of
                            the new one over the old by actual experiment. For <pb facs="0781"
                                n="47" xml:id="pg_47"/> these reasons I am inclined to lay some
                            stress upon the suggestion already made as to the exhibition of American
                            productions, and to propose the establishment of a depot in this city
                            for that purpose. Such a depot might be organized and maintained
                            entirely by private enterprise and at very moderate expense, all
                            interests sharing in its advantages which do not conflict with each
                            other, and which could agree upon a common agency for its supervision
                            and maintenance. As to the benefits to be derived from such an
                            arrangement, I have not a doubt. If international industrial
                            expositions, which are necessarily temporary in their character, have
                            accrued to the advantage of the exhibitors, much more would this, the
                            effect of which must be direct and continuing. If, by State and county
                            fairs and other similar exhibitions, our own people are made familiar,
                            year by year, with the various fruits of skilled labor and the newest
                            appliances, of the mechanic arts, and if thereby sales are accelerated
                            and trade extended, the same means, permanently and directly applied,
                            must produce the same or even greater results abroad than they produce
                            at home. A better place for locating such a depot as I have suggested
                            could scarcely be found in Germany than Frankfort. It is the most
                            central of the large cities of the empire, and readily communicates with
                            all parts of it by rail. The extent of its railway passenger traffic may
                            be estimated from the fact that nearly two hundred passenger trains
                            (188) arrive at and leave its various depots every twenty-four hours.
                            Its convenience of access makes it the favorite place of meeting for all
                            kinds of societies’ anniversaries and national or provincial
                            conventions; audits two neighboring watering-places, Homburg and
                            Wiesbaden, together with its historical and social attractions, bring to
                            it and through it, every season, tourists from all parts of the world.
                            It is also, as is well known, a leading commercial center, having large
                            American interests, and affording rates of exchange and conveniences of
                            remittance not excelled on the continent.</p>
                        <p>In the matter of transportation to and from America the advantages of
                            Frankfort are no less marked. Lying in the heart of Germany and of the
                            Continent, it is nevertheless accessible by water the entire distance
                            from New York or Philadelphia. Goods shipped by steamer to Rotterdam may
                            there be forwarded by Rhine boat to Mayence, and thence, by smaller
                            boats, up the river Main (twenty miles) to Frankfort.</p>
                        <p>The project of deepening the channel of the Main, now likely to be
                            executed within two or three years, will enable the largest Rhine boats
                            to ascend to Frankfort, thereby reducing the number of necessary
                            transshipments between the United States and this city to one only.</p>
                        <p>These suggestions I respectfully submit for what they may be worth,
                            hoping that any imperfections that may be discovered therein may be
                            charitably considered.</p>

                        <p>Resuming the topic of my dispatch No. 36, I have to offer some additional
                            facts and observations, which, I hope, may be of use in pointing out
                            methods for advancing our commercial interests in Germany.</p>
                        <pb facs="0782" n="48" xml:id="pg_48"/>
                        <p>It must be premised in the beginning that depression of business makes
                            frugal purchasers. That such depression has prevailed in Germany for
                            four years past, and still prevails, is the universal testimony. That it
                            may yet continue for some time to come is quite possible. The disastrous
                            outcome of the grape-crop this year will largely diminish one of the
                            great sources of commercial revenue and means of productive interchange.
                            The failure of negotiations for renewal of the commercial treaty with
                            Austria may deprive many producers of their accustomed market, and throw
                            them back upon the surfeited demands of home consumption. Much depends
                            also upon the course of political events in Europe; the enduring
                            apprehension of war, and the necessity of maintaining an immense
                            armament, constitute a dispiriting incubus upon productive industry. At
                            the same time a protective tariff is threatened, and its possible
                            enactment is a contingency that deserves to be at least considered. A
                            large proportion of the manufacturing element is clamorous for it, and
                            the general complaint of tax burdens, which, no doubt, seem more
                            oppressive under the direct than they would under the indirect system,
                            encourages resort to it as a matter of revenue expediency. A small but
                            continuing deficit in the national exchequer re-enforces the arguments
                            in favor of new and indirect sources of revenue. The cries of labor
                            unemployed mingle with those of manufacturers whose mills are idle, or
                            nearly so, and who are realizing more and more the pressure of foreign
                            competition. Against all this stand a strong free-trade sentiment, the
                            fixed policy of the nation, and the apprehension of increasing the cost
                            of raw material to the manufacturer, and of the manufactured product to
                            the consumer.</p>
                        <p>The American importer must also be prepared to contend against cheap
                            imitations of his wares. Already such imitations are common in the
                            German market, and they have in some instances impelled our people to
                            fight the imitators with their own class of weapons. But this course is
                            not to be commended, either as a matter of expediency or profit. It
                            injures the general reputation of our wares, and at best secures only a
                            temporary benefit.</p>
                        <p>Another obstacle to be met is the cheapness of labor, which affords a
                            powerful agency for competition with more expensive, albeit more skilled
                            production; it not only reduces the cost of a given product, but
                            sometimes furnishes an incentive for dispensing with that product. Where
                            labor is so inexpensive there will always be a certain reluctance toward
                            buying the appliances that economize it. There will also exist the
                            jealousy of labor itself against such appliances.</p>
                        <p>It can be scarcely doubtful, as a corollary from these observations, that
                            an improvement of business in Germany would make her a better customer
                            of the United States, and that until such improvement comes, she will
                            have many powerful motives for frugality in her purchases.</p>
                        <p>Against these adverse circumstances, however, many others of great force
                            are operating, and will operate in favor of our producers. First among
                            these may be mentioned the abundance of money with which Germany has
                            been blessed, if it may be called a blessing. The empire has a large
                            amount of surplus coin which it is anxious to dispose of to the best
                            advantage. If Americans can supply the articles which are in demand in
                            the German market, there is an obvious opportunity for them to obtain
                            this coin in exchange for their goods. A surplus of the purchasing
                            medium naturally predisposes its possessor to be a purchaser rather than
                            a producer. The German Empire has been subject to the influences of such
                            a condition ever since the French indemnity was paid. She is making
                            energetic efforts to escape from them, it is true, and to <pb
                                facs="0783" n="49" xml:id="pg_49"/> restore the necessity of
                            creating values by reducing the means of acquiring them, but the process
                            has not yet been completed, and the currents of trade meanwhile are
                            forming, indeed have formed, new and permanent channels.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, German industry has not progressed, either in the
                            quality or quantity of its productions, and in attestation of this it is
                            easy to cite an abundance of German testimony. In a memorial recently
                            presented to the chancellor of the empire by German merchants of
                            Montevideo, South America, they say: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The official reports of the German commission to the Philadelphia
                                    Exposition have confirmed impressions we have long entertained.
                                    It is a fact that German manufactured articles are more and more
                                    supplanted in the market by those of other countries, and that,
                                    under the influence of competition, German importations are
                                    continually lessening. In our opinion, the following are some of
                                    the causes which have contributed to this result, and which have
                                    been observed in all the markets of the world: <list>

                                            ambition seems to be to make cheap goods of inferior
                                            quality, and sell them in large quantities.</item>

                                    manufacturers monopolize the market. Recently the English have
                                    also been making the French novelties in dress-fabrics, but the
                                    Germans have not progressed in this way. On the contrary, they
                                    have resorted to the production of cheap goods, of poor
                                    material, and unsalable patterns. Besides, nearly all the German
                                    dress-goods fail to keep measure, while the measure of English
                                    goods is correct, and it follows that when the importer opens
                                    correspondence with the manufacturer and complains of short
                                    measure, it often ends very unsatisfactorily.</p>
                                <p>The German manufactures of iron stand well the competition with
                                    English and Belgian. Of German wire for fencing, and strap-iron
                                    for packing, large quantities are consumed. Wire tacks are
                                    mostly imported from Germany, but not always to the satisfaction
                                    of the importer. The tacks are sold by weight, and it often
                                    happens that four or five times more wrapping-paper is used than
                                    by the manufacturers of Holland, Belgium, and France, and that
                                    two numbers are put in one package, when only the thinner was
                                    ordered.</p>
                                <p>We have the same complaint to make of chains manufactured from
                                    wire. When a particular number is ordered, it often happens that
                                    a thicker number of wire has been used, and since chains are
                                    sold by weight, it is a loss and damage to the importer.</p>
                                <p>It is nearly impossible to sell woolen goods, flannels, shawls,
                                    tarlatans, pantaloons-stuff, and hosiery by sample, for there is
                                    often a great difference between the samples and the goods
                                    delivered. Besides, there is general complaint of want of
                                    promptness, both in correspondence and in forwarding goods.</p>

                        <p>Further home testimony to the same effect is by no means wanting, and,
                            like the foregoing, might be equally useful on our side of the Atlantic,
                            both by way of instruction and admonition. Space will not admit,
                            however, of more than one or two more citations. An experienced German
                            citizen, who deals largely in many kinds of machinery, homemade and
                            imported, frankly states that the German manufactures are not only
                            becoming dearer, but “are lacking in finish, and are impractical;”</p>
                        <p>As illustrating this point, as well as others to which reference will be
                            made, the same gentleman’s statements may be quoted in this connection,
                            as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Forks for handling hay, straw, and manure, though distrusted at
                                    first, now forma respectable item of importation from the United
                                    States.</p>
                                <p>About ten years ago I brought these implements over from England,
                                    and found great <pb facs="0784" n="50" xml:id="pg_50"/>
                                    difficulty in introducing them, because, in the first place, the
                                    German farmer sticks to old custom and likes to oppose
                                    innovation. Higher prices increased the difficulties. However,
                                    the forks came gradually into use. A German house soon imitated
                                    them, and its prices being much below the English, I was obliged
                                    to buy a large quantity in order to meet competition.</p>
                                <p>This state of things did not last long. The German house had used
                                    German wood for the handles, while the English had employed
                                    American wood, and in a few weeks I had so many complaints of
                                    breakage of the German handles that I had to give them up
                                    altogether. I now applied to the United States, and obtained
                                    excellent handles from a very good firm; but even then they
                                    became too expensive, in proportion, and, as people began to get
                                    used to American forks, I imported them in considerable
                                    quantities from an American house. The example was soon followed
                                    by other firms of the United States, who overstocked the market
                                    with trash at very cheap prices, sent travelers in every
                                    direction, and at last created a complete distrust with regard
                                    to American forks.</p>

                        <p>The report of the imperial commission to the Centennial Exposition may be
                            cited in confirmation of these statements, so far as they indicate the
                            condition of German manufacturing industry. That there has been a great
                            decline in the quantity of manufactured products is still more
                            demonstrable. On this subject, especially as relates to the past twelve
                            months, the following expressions are given by twelve leading
                            manufacturers in various parts of Eastern and Southern Germany:</p>
                        <p>1. Production one-fifth less than in 1876; 2. Production one-third less
                            than last year; 3. Production has increased; 4. Production 20 per cent.
                            less than last year; 5. Production less than last year; 6. Production
                            same as last year. If workmen have been dismissed, those remaining have
                            worked harder. Where time has been reduced production has been
                            diminished; 7. Production 20 per cent. greater than last year; 8.
                            Production one-third less than last year; 9. Manufacturers continually
                            discharging operatives; 10. Production about the same as in 1875; 11.
                            Working hours reduced one-third. Production one-third less than last
                            year; 12. Make 20 per cent. fewer machines than last year.</p>
                        <p>So large a decline within the past year, as the majority of these
                            statements indicates, preceded, as it must have been, by a corresponding
                            previous decline of much duration, would seem to strongly confirm the
                            view that the period of overproduction has substantially passed. There
                            may, indeed, be still a surplus of cheap, shoddy goods in the market,
                            but that is scarcely so much overproduction as abnormal or diseased
                            production, and cannot be considered a very formidable element of
                            competition with superior articles offered at proportionately equal or
                            lower prices. It is therefore a justifiable hypothesis, to say the
                            least, that a market in which production has so greatly declined in
                            quantity, and has either not progressed, or has deteriorated in quality,
                            is prepared for the reception of new, improved, or superior wares of
                            American manufacture, and may profit by their introduction.</p>
                        <p>The American producer has in his favor another important consideration,
                            which was briefly suggested in a previous dispatch. The large
                            German-born population of the United States, and the friendly relations
                            which have so long existed between the empire and the republic,
                            naturally predispose the German people to a like friendly feeling with
                            regard to our productions. It may be said, indeed, that as our country
                            is the favorite resort of the German emigrant, and our securities the
                            favorite investment of the German capitalist, so our products are, of
                            all foreign kinds, pre-eminently the favorites in the German market. The
                            articles themselves have mostly created, and have generally well
                            sustained, this favorable opinion; and it is of the highest importance
                            to American interests in Germany that they should sustain it equally
                            well, or even better, in the future.</p>
                        <p>The great variety and undeveloped extent of American resources also <pb
                                facs="0785" n="51" xml:id="pg_51"/> add much to the chances of
                            improving our trade in this part of the continent. Germany is not a
                            country of extraordinary fertility. In minerals, in agriculture, and in
                            the mechanic arts, the United States possess many advantages not known
                            here, or at least not in the same wonderful variety and profuseness.
                            American labor is not distracted, and confused by the same military
                            contingencies, nor hampered by the same poverty of opportunities, and
                            industrial energy being at once more free and more concentrated, is also
                            more progressive. With greater resources, incentives, and possibilities,
                            it would be strange if we were not able both to supply wares not
                            produced here, and to excel, in many respects, those of continental
                            production. This is both reasonable and natural, and it is a fact which
                            is generously appreciated in Germany. It will be much in our favor if we
                            shall not fail in a similar appreciation of the respects in which
                            Germany possesses resources peculiar to herself, and in such it is to
                            our advantage to patronize her artisans.</p>
                        <p>As to the measures by and the specific cases in which our countrymen may
                            avail themselves of the foregoing favorable conditions, there is as
                            great diversity of opinion as there is great room for it. Question a
                            German on this subject, and in nineteen cases out of twenty the
                            stereotyped reply will be, “Reduce your high protective tariff and you
                            will improve trade both ways.” As to this suggestion, I have to repeat
                            the remark made on a former occasion, that if our manufacturers can
                            produce articles better, and, on the whole, cheaper than they can be
                            produced here the Germans will buy them without thinking of our tariff.
                            In other words, they will not allow their prejudices against our
                            protective system to stand in the way of their pecuniary interests. Yet
                            there is much ground for the belief that some concessions to the German
                            feeling in this regard may now be profitably made, and with mutual
                            benefit to the two countries. To such raw materials, for instance, as
                            can be more cheaply produced in Germany than in the United States, this
                            remark may be especially applied. It is further applicable to such
                            articles as we cannot make for want of materials. To suggest such
                            articles or materials is, perhaps, unnecessary, as the American
                            manufacturer must have better advantages for forming an intelligent
                            opinion on this subject than any one not directly engaged in
                            manufacturing.</p>
                        <p>Among all measures that can be suggested for improving American trade in
                            Germany, and in Europe generally, none seems to be of such pressing
                            necessity and great utility as the return to a fixed standard of values
                            by our government and people. Indeed, I should regard this as the one
                            indispensable condition to the proper development of American interests
                            on this continent. By fixed standard is meant, in this connection, one
                            that is placed beyond the reach of artificial fluctuations in coin no
                            less than in paper, whether by virtue of our own legislation or the
                            speculative enterprises of foreign individuals or governments. The
                            advantages of such a standard appear so obvious from this point of view
                            that it seems superfluous to suggest them. A chance observation-of the
                            currents of trade is sufficient to show that in this part of the world
                            one of the chief obstacles to American commerce has been the incessant
                            fluctuation of prices, evidently due to the fluctuation of our currency.
                            The American exporter has been, and still is, obliged to fix his prices
                            at a standard high enough to cover risks of such changes of values
                            between the time of receiving orders and that of filling them, and has
                            therefore been placed at a great disadvantage with the German exporter,
                            by whom the cost of production and the margin of profit could be safely
                            calculated for months beforehand. Many similar considerations might be
                            mentioned, but they are such as every intelligent <pb facs="0786" n="52"
                                xml:id="pg_52"/> manufacturer must be already familiar with. Only
                            this further suggestion may be made, that the German importer naturally
                            prefers to deal with a country whose standard of values is fixed, and
                            which does not expose him to loss on large investments by enabling his
                            competitors to avail themselves of sudden currency fluctuations.</p>
                        <p>Another condition of success in the German market, as in any other, is,
                            that it shall be carefully studied. It has its peculiarities, growing
                            out of the habits of the people, their system of finance, and the
                            physical and political character of their country. American or other
                            foreign dealers who undertake to supply such a market directly from home
                            fall into a multitude of misapprehensions and mistakes, and the
                            profitableness of their ventures is a mere matter of chance. On the
                            other hand, if they commit their business wholly to foreign agencies,
                            they are at the mercy of others over whom they have little control, and
                            who, though perhaps entirely responsible, cannot be expected to take the
                            same interest in selling an article that the owner does. As between
                            these two extremes there is, perhaps, a safer and more advantageous
                            ground. If the American producer could extend a personal or modified
                            supervision over his agents abroad, there is scarcely a doubt that it
                            would inure greatly to his advantage. As to his best means of doing this
                            he may, of course, have his own views, and must be governed largely by
                            his own circumstances. This suggestion may, however, be ventured, that
                            if a profitable trade of any kind is expected in Germany, it is worthy
                            of some special expenditure and effort. Time and patience, as well as
                            money, may be required to build it up, and neither hired nor volunteer
                            agents, who have no direct interest, can be expected always to
                            accomplish the most that might be done in this behalf.</p>
                        <p>The Germans, in their dealings with foreigners, are not fond of a circle
                            of intermediaries. They prefer to get as near to the original
                            individuals with whom they deal as circumstances will permit. Greatly
                            attached to their own customs, they are not more readily reconciled to
                            foreign innovations by receiving them at third or fourth hand. In any
                            case, they wish to have time and opportunity to thoroughly investigate
                            before they purchase, and to try a new article before discarding an old
                            one. They like also to be sure that the dealer who offers it to them is
                            responsible, and stakes a reputation, at least, upon the good faith of
                            his pledges. It is of great advantage to the seller, on the other hand,
                            that he should know how to avoid offending the prejudices of the people
                            and begetting their mistrust.</p>
                        <p>There seem to be two feasible plans of accomplishing these objects. One
                            is that of erecting branch establishments on the continent, when the
                            business will justify it, and the other, that of permanent co-operative
                            depots for the exhibition and sale of American goods. The latter plan
                            was suggested in a previous dispatch, and subsequent observation has
                            strongly confirmed the impressions on which the suggestion was based.
                            Depots of this kind, each combining several interests, would certainly
                            cost much less than the erection of separate branch establishments for
                            each interest. Such a depot in Frankfort, for instance, would attract
                            great attention, as, indeed, the bare suggestion of it has, and would
                            place American fabrics before the inspection of both wholesale and
                            retail dealers from all parts of the empire. It would afford the
                            opportunity for examination and trial which is so important. It would be
                            as much as to say, “We covet the inspection of our wares, and only
                            desire that their merits may be understood.” It would bring the American
                            manufacturer into direct, or almost direct, contact with the people
                            here, and be to them a continual assurance of responsibility and <pb
                                facs="0787" n="53" xml:id="pg_53"/> good faith. To Americans it
                            would be in the nature of a school for the study of the German market,
                            and to Germans a like agency for instruction in the merits of American
                            production. It would enable the Germans to see what we have to sell, and
                            the Americans to see what they may profitably buy in Germany. Its
                            effects would be in kind the same, but in degree greater than those of a
                            State fair, or an international exposition, because its influence would
                            be more permanent and more directly applied. Considering its duration,
                            its expense would be even less than such an exhibition, and the
                            commissions, not to say the losses, it might save would doubtless more
                            than bear the expense of its maintenance.</p>
                        <p>The details of organizing such an establishment could be safely left to
                            the business tact and judgment of those who might choose to undertake
                            it. There seems to be no objection to combining within the scope of its
                            operations any number of interests not antagonistic to each other. It
                            might be organized as a joint-stock concern, or on the co operative
                            principle. Two things are indispensable, first, that it shall be
                            undertaken in no spirit of speculative adventure, but as a legitimate
                            business transaction; and second, that all shoddy wares shall be
                            inexorably excluded from the scope of its operations. It may be simply a
                            warehouse for exhibition, or also an agency for taking orders, as may
                            prove best. It need not deal directly with retailers, and does not imply
                            that all agencies and middle men are to be dispensed with. On the
                            contrary it may make such agencies and middle men more useful than ever
                            by bringing them under more direct supervision of their employers.</p>
                        <p>Since this matter was first suggested in my dispatch No. 36, many notices
                            of the suggestion have appeared in the German press, evidently derived
                            from American newspapers, and doubtless emanating from information given
                            out by the Department. Many letters have consequently been written to
                            this office in regard to it, and many personal inquiries have been made.
                            But in no instance has objection been made to the project, except on the
                            part of agents who feared that it meant the loss of their occupation. A
                            sample expression of this latter kind is herewith forwarded.</p>
                        <p>In harmony with these suggestions, and as a further means of advancing
                            American trade in Germany, and in Europe generally, may be represented
                            the importance of a creditable exhibit of American products at the
                            approaching French International Exposition. The gravity of this matter
                            can scarcely be overestimated. Through the reports of European visitors
                            to the Centennial Exposition, our people have established a reputation
                            on this side the Atlantic as skilled producers, which it is of the
                            hightest importance for them to maintain. There are indications that
                            great efforts will be made by Germany to redeem herself at Paris from
                            the unfavorable impressions that have grown out of her Philadelphia
                            showing. Should our country make a feeble exhibition of her products
                            beside the good one which Germany is likely to make of hers, our
                            producers must be greatly injured, and the good things that have been
                            said of them will be largely discredited. Any stint of expenditure,
                            therefore, whether public or private, which prevents a first-class
                            American showing at Paris, will be short-sighted in the extreme.</p>
                        <p>Spurred by outside competition and formidable rivalries, Germany will
                            probably herself hold an international exhibition within the next five
                            years. Already suggestions are made to that effect, which show that the
                            necessity of doing the utmost to maintain and improve the reputation of
                            German manufactures is being realized.</p>
                        <pb facs="0788" n="54" xml:id="pg_54"/>
                        <p>As to the particular branches of production in which American trade may
                            be improved, many suggestions given; but all are more or less
                            hypothetical in the absence of experiment. No doubt actual effort to
                            increase trade would show the increase to be practicable where it is
                            little dreamed of now, and impracticable, perhaps, where it is most
                            expected. The exhibition plan, which has been suggested, would afford
                            the best and cheapest opportunities for bringing this matter to the
                            test. The Germans would no doubt largely develop their own wants and
                            demands after having a better chance to see what we have to sell.
                            Meanwhile, as a basis of opinion, some information may here be given as
                            to the condition of particular branches of industry and of American
                            trade in this part of Germany.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">leather</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Large quantities of this commodity are manufactured within the district
                            of Frankfort and Mayence, and the exports to the United States were
                            formerly very large. But the enterprise of American tanners has reversed
                            this state of things, so far as the heavier leathers are concerned.
                            Copies of two letters, marked respectively C and D, are hereto appended,
                            the first being written by a prominent leather-dealer of this city, and
                            the second by a leading leather manufacturing firm of Mayence. These
                            letters are significant of the prevailing views of the classes of
                            persons which the writers represent as to the present condition of the
                            German leather trade and production, and as to the relations of American
                            competition thereto. The loss of our market for the heavier leathers,
                            aggravated by the strong competition of our manufactures with those of
                            Germany, on their own ground, has naturally caused much chagrin. But
                            this can be no longer helped. The reverses in the currents of our
                            leather trade are permanent, and the German manufacturer, recognizing
                            this, would be content now if our duties were lowered on the finer
                            leathers, in which he claims to be able to surpass us as to cost and
                            quality. He argues, as usual, that the reduction of duties would be a
                            mutual advantage to both countries, and the course by which he reaches
                            this conclusion is sufficiently indicated by the letters already
                            cited.</p>
                        <p>The production of leather does not seem to have been prosperous in
                            Germany during the past year. One firm attributes this to
                            “overproduction,” another to the fact that “raw hides cost so much,” and
                            another to “American competition.” Perhaps all these causes have
                            operated together. Producers of lac-varnished calf-leather, it is said,
                            have lost money, while the small tanneries have had most profit. When
                            exports to the United States fell off, a market was sought and found in
                            England. Imports of oak and hemlock leather from America, for saddlers’
                            purposes, have steadily increased since 1872. The German tanners have,
                            in consequence, petitioned their government for an increase of duties on
                            leather of all sorts, but no increase has yet taken place.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">agricultural implements</hi>.</p>
                        <p>In this branch of manufacture the Americans indisputably lead Many
                            reaping and mowing-machines, horse-rakes, and a large variety of harvest
                            hardwares are sold in this city, all of American manufacture. The
                            testimony of dealers is that the American machines and tools easily
                            out-sell the German of the same kind, though there is some objection to
                            our reapers on account of their apparently greater weakness of
                            construction. <pb facs="0789" n="55" xml:id="pg_55"/> Cologne, also, is
                            a good market for our implements of agriculture. In Frankfort, of late,
                            the demand for steam-engines and iron machines has somewhat lessened,
                            but there has been a good call for milling and grain-cleaning apparatus,
                            of which there has been a considerable export to Russia and Rournania.
                            Reapers and mowers are but little used in this immediate neighborhood,
                            owing in part to the division of the land into small tracts.</p>
                        <p>As pertaining to the sale of agricultural implements, and illustrating
                            the mistakes liable to be made through misapprehension of this market,
                            reference may be made here to an advertising circular, to which my
                            attention has been called, sent out by an American firm. The circular is
                            intended to advertise a new horse-rake, of which the advertisers are
                            proprietors, and undertakes to commend the article to the German mind by
                            representing it as drawn by a magnificent tiger, driven by a gaily
                            dressed young woman, the whole pictured in brilliant colors. The
                            circular is a well-meant pleasantry, which would be readily understood
                            at home, but here its effect is to stamp the machine as a humbug, rather
                            than to commend it.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">sewing-machines</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The principal American sewing-machine companies have extensive agencies
                            in Frankfort, and seem to be doing a satisfactory business. In and near
                            this city are also manufactured from 16,000 to 18,000 German machines
                            every year, the establishments employing several hundreds of of workmen.
                            The production of these establishments last year was about 20 per cent.
                            less than in 1875, and the prices of their machines about 15 per cent.
                            less.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">boot and shoe machines</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The New England inventors and manufacturers of these machines are
                            represented by a branch establishment in Frankfort, from which large
                            numbers of their contrivances are being sold in all parts of the empire.
                            This enterprise illustrates, indeed, what may be accomplished by
                            Americans in Germany by a careful study of the people, and by a patient
                            and intelligent effort to build up a business among them. The
                            establishment is managed by native Americans, who have learned the
                            German language while prosecuting their business.</p>

                        <p>Americans have a great advantage in this line of manufactures on account
                            of the abundance and superior quality of their woods. Our bent work, so
                            largely and successfully made in the West, would scarcely have a rival
                            here. The toughest and best kinds of wood used for articles of that
                            class do not grow in Germany, and even the commoner varieties are by no
                            means so plentiful as with us. No doubt the sale of our general articles

                        <p>In this line there is some demand for American products, but the styles
                            of articles now in use have become so imbedded in the habits of the
                            people that any change, even in the way of improvement, is very
                            difficult. There is no telling, however, what continued perseverance in
                            the offer of superior wares may accomplish.</p>

                        <p>Generally the American styles are not suited to the German market because
                            of the different modes of cooking and living. There are, however, some
                            exceptional conveniences of the American kitchen and household which the
                            people here seem to like, and which might no doubt find a profitable
                            sale.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">rubber goods</hi>.</p>
                        <p>These and kindred articles of American make have been favorably received
                            in Germany, and doubtless the trade might be considerably increased.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">shirtings</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The principal continental supply of these fabrics is obtained from
                            Alsace. American shirtings have been profitably sold in Frankfort for
                            two years past, and are found to be cheaper than the English. They well
                            hold their place in this market, and, as there is much demand for them,
                            their sale will probably increase. American shirtings are being
                            extensively introduced also in other parts of Germany.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">silks</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The sale of American silks has been tried here, but complaint is made
                            that they are dearer than those of Lyons, Crefeld, and Switzerland.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">prints</hi>.</p>
                        <p>In this line there would seem to be a chance of successful competition
                            with the English article. The very low cost at which the best prints are
                            now made in the United States encourages this idea, and the chances of
                            its success are certainly worthy of a fair test.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">dairy products</hi>.</p>
                        <p>It would seem that the cheap and enormous pasturages of our Western
                            States ought to enable us to export the products of the dairy profitably
                            at the prices they usually bring here. In this part of Germany the
                            supplies of cheese are drawn chiefly from Switzerland, Bavaria, and
                            Würtemberg. The article is also imported from Austria, France, Belgium,
                            Holland, and Italy. In Saxony and Holstein are extensive manufactories
                            of cheese, but their product is not consumed in this neighborhood. A
                            large amount of Swiss cheese is exported to America, but the American
                            article does not appear to be familiar to the continental market. The
                            coin prices of butter and cheese in Frankfort and Mayence during the
                            past year have been as follows:</p>
                        <p>Swiss cheese, per 100 pounds, $22.32 to $23,50; per pound, retail, 28
                            cents.</p>
                        <p>Bavarian cheese, per 100 pounds, $18.80 to $19.95; per pound, retail, 22½
                            to. 23½ cents.</p>
                        <p>Limburger cheese, per 100 pounds, $10.81 to $12.92; per pound, retail, 13
                            to 16½ cents.</p>
                        <p>Butter per pound, wholesale, 24 cents; retail, 28 to 30 cents.</p>
                        <p>Butter is said to be 25 per cent. cheaper than last year, on account of
                            its reduced consumption on the part of working people deprived of
                            employment. There is no trade in American butter or cheese, but it is
                            the opinion of intelligent dealers here that these articles might be
                            successfully introduced.</p>

                        <p>The American dead-meat trade in England has attracted attention all over
                            Europe, and its success there justifies the expectation that it may yet
                            be extended to this continent. Delivery of the meat at Rotterdam, its
                            transfer there to refrigerating Rhine-steamers, and its conveyance to
                            the markets of Cologne, Coblentz, Mayence, Frankfort, and Mannheim, does
                            not, in the light of experience, seem to be beyond the range of
                            possibility.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">canned goods</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The canned meats of Chicago are familiar to this market, and may be seen
                            in the windows of every grocery. American fruits and jellies are
                            extensively sold. There is evidently a large and lucrative field in this
                            business for those who know how to improve it.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">watches</hi>.</p>
                        <p>In a national convention of watch manufacturers held at Wiesbaden
                            recently, the following declarations were made: “The International
                            Exposition, at Philadelphia, has shown that the Americans have, within a
                            few years, established-watch manufactories in their country, which, with
                            their energy and use of machines, have superseded the Swiss watch
                            industry for cheap watches. There is every reason to believe that the
                            Swiss manufacturers cannot any longer compete with the Americans, and
                            that they are almost forced to adopt the American system of
                            fabrication.”</p>

                        <p>These articles of American manufacture are now having a fair sale in this

                            <p>We never have strikes, for our district is not, properly speaking, a
                                manufacturing one. Dismissed workmen nearly always look for
                                employment in small shops, or become laborers at buildings, &amp;c.
                                They seldom look for work in the country, where there is a great
                                want of workmen. The country people dislike the town and city
                                workmen, and the latter dislike life in the country, which is frugal
                                and wretched.</p>
                            <p>The law and the custom require that employer and employed shall
                                reciprocally give fourteen days’ notice before terminating a labor
                                contract. [This is the all but universal method of engaging laborers
                                and artisans in Germany. Written contracts are very seldom made.—A.
                                E. L.] Workmen have a given time for breakfast and other meals.
                                There is very seldom any stipulation as to obligations of the master
                                to the workmen.</p>
                            <p>Meat is higher in price this year than it was last. Bread is cheaper.
                                Potatoes and vegetables are 10 to 20 per cent. lower; while clothing
                                and rents are the same as last year. Clothing cannot be made
                                cheaper, because the merchants lose too much by giving credit, and
                                have to make it up on those who pay. Well-organized
                                consumption-societies, with honest management, would be the only
                                manner of releasing a large part of the workmen from their miserable
                                lot.</p>
                            <p>* * * On the whole, production is about equal to that of last year.
                                Where workmen were dismissed, those remaining have worked harder. In
                                some branches there has been a reduction of time for labor, and in
                                such cases production may have been less. Its amount, however, is
                                not always proportionate to the time occupied by the laborer. Two
                                men, for example, who work twelve hours will not accomplish as much
                                as three men who work eight hours. Only at the rate of eight, or, at
                                most, ten, hours’ employment per day can the workmen accomplish the
                                best results.</p>
                            <p>The perpetual apprehensions of war, on the part of the people, and of
                                social troubles on the part of the government, depress trade. Since
                                nobody expects much from the future, nobody allows himself a luxury.
                                This is instantly felt in the workshops, where even workmen drink
                                poorer coffee and use poorer cigars than ever before. People lessen
                                their wants in all directions, and therefore manufacturers try to
                                make cheaper wares, and make them poorer. Consequently all
                                manufactured articles have depreciated in every respect during the
                                last four years. With exception of those who gamble on ’change,
                                nobody gains anything. If the continual rattle of arms would cease,
                                and the social question were earnestly considered, confidence would
                                soon resume its old place, and trade would flourish.</p>
                            <p>The government, too, may accomplish much by exerting itself against
                                all kinds of dishonest business, and aiding those who try to elevate
                                trade by honest means.</p>

                                    <item>The use of bills of lading, such as have been introduced
                                        in the English colonies. Under this system the orderer does
                                        not receive the goods before he has paid the bill of
                                        exchange, and of course it is made impossible, in this way,
                                        to give credit across the ocean. It is plainly not the duty
                                        of a German manufacturer to give the use of his capital to
                                        an American customer to help the progress of the latter’s
                                        business. If the American customer needs credit, he should
                                        be able to get it from bankers at home. In this manner
                                        business can be done directly by an agent without capital,
                                        between producer and consumer, and there is not half as much
                                        risk for the manufacturer as under the present method. It is
                                        also from this manner of payment that all German articles
                                        can be had for nearly the same price in the wholesale stores
                                        of Calcutta, Melbourne, &amp;c., as in Berlin, Breslau, or
                                        Munich. A great many English and colonial banks live
                                        entirely upon the discount of such bills of lading, and to
                                        the honor of English merchants it must be said that there
                                        has never been a fraud committed by giving an order on a
                                        fictitious person.</item>

                                    <item>To introduce more American articles into Germany, it would
                                        be well to have American warehouses in Berlin, Leipzic,
                                        Breslau, Cologne, Frankfort, Stuttgart, and Munich. From
                                        these points all parts of the empire could be easily
                                        reached. By this arrangement the American producer could,
                                        with greater security, have a larger profit, for the present
                                        losses by discounts, agents, shipmen, &amp;c., would be
                                        saved.</item>

                            <p>American manufacturers should also send representatives to the fairs
                                of Frankfort and Leipzic with samples. At the Leipzic fair collect
                                wholesale merchants, not from Germany only, but from Austria,
                                Russia, Roumania, Servia, Scandinavia, Holland, and Switzerland.
                                Frankfort-on-the-Oder has three fairs, not only for all Germany, but
                                for Poland and Russia.</p>

                            <p>The import of American articles of industry into Germany has been
                                slowly but steadily increasing, and it seems as though the two
                                countries might, in future, reverse the trade relations that have
                                heretofore existed between them. Ten years ago North America was the
                                best market for German goods, but now such articles mainly find
                                their way across the Atlantic as are not yet manufactured in the
                                United States. The Americans are already sending to Germany many
                                articles of their skill and invention. American machinery and tools,
                                particularly, are much in demand here, and have been brought over in
                                large quantities.</p>
                            <p>The superiority of the American people, as a manufacturing nation,
                                over all nations of the Old World, particularly in the mode of
                                working, has been clearly proved by the Centennial Exposition in
                                Philadelphia. The comprehension of this fact can be found in almost
                                all the reports of the European commissioners to their respective
                                governments. The consequence has been that the German authorities,
                                and all classes concerned, are discussing the measures to be taken
                                to protect the industry of this courrtry against a new and powerful
                                competitor.</p>
                            <p>It has been further understood that one of the main reasons for the
                                decline of German industry has been the want of a useful and
                                practical patent-law. This omittance has now been recovered. The new
                                German patent-law, which has now been in existence since last July,
                                is mainly formed after the patent institutions of the United States,
                                and gives full protection to the inventor and patent owner. Others
                                have proposed the introduction of a protective tariff, but this
                                scheme has not found the support of the people.</p>
                            <p>It cannot be doubted that the exertions now everywhere made to
                                elevate German skill and industry will have good effects, and will
                                assure to this country an important position among the manufacturing
                                nations of the globe.</p>
                            <p>As far as the products of agriculture are concerned, the question of
                                importing from America is settled by the price at which such
                                products can be brought to the European market. American grain,
                                flour, meat, and raw materials of various kinds are brought over
                                here in large quantities, but I think the import of farming products
                                could be still further increased if the American railways would
                                reduce their freight-tariffs from the Western States to the Atlantic
                                seaboard. In recent years American preserved meats, fruits, and
                                other delicacies have been introduced in this country with good
                                success. The more such articles become known, the more the
                                consumption of them must increase, if sold at prices proportionate
                                to those paid here for similar articles.</p>
                            <p>American shirtings have also been brought over here lately, and their
                                quality has proved satisfactory.</p>
                            <pb facs="0794" n="60" xml:id="pg_60"/>
                            <p>The trade in American machinery and tools has been increasing yearly;
                                but, owing to their high prices, they have been imitated by German
                                manufacturers, and this German make is now preferred here at low
                                prices. American manufacturers should therefore not fail to have
                                their inventions and improvements patented in this country, and
                                should also endeavor to introduce their goods at the lowest possible
                                prices.</p>
                            <p>Some of the American manufacturers of agricultural machinery and of
                                sewing-machines have established themselves in Hamburg, Berlin, arid
                                other German cities, and are doing an extensive trade, dealing
                                directly with consumers. This plan is to be commended where it is
                                necessary to introduce an entirely new article, as agents and
                                commission-houses seldom undergo the trouble and expense which are
                                unavoidable in such cases. I, myself, have brought over from the
                                Centennial Exhibition a large variety of improved American articles,
                                household implements, improved cooking-stoves, machinery, &amp;c.,
                                but have found the introduction of those articles to incur great
                                trouble and expense. The people here are prejudiced against
                                novelties and improved implements which differ too much from their
                                own, and the introduction of such articles will always prove to be a
                                failure where the task is left to agents an d’com mission-merchants.
                                Time and constant explanation are necessary to convince the people
                                of the worth of a new and improved article. Every province of this
                                country has its own style of implements and tools.</p>
                            <p>The prospects of American exports to this country depend mainly upon
                                the price at which American goods can be sold here, upon the manner
                                in which American inventions and implements are introduced, and,
                                lastly, upon the position which German industry will occupy with
                                relation to American in future years.</p>

                            <p>The export from Germany to the United States in upper-leather, such
                                as calf, kid, and goat skins, was very large up to 1867, and ten
                                years ago had reached an enormous amount. From that time, however,
                                it decreased, and became less year by year, so that to-day the
                                export is limited to a small portion of the above.</p>
                            <p>Asking what may be the cause of this rapid and astonishing change, I
                                find that the principal cause lies in the great progress of the
                                American leather industry within recent years.</p>
                            <p>The American manufacturers worked with gigantic energy and progress
                                to raise the leather industry to the greatest possible perfection,
                                and they have now advanced so much that the former supplies in
                                imported stock are now covered by home production, which not only
                                seems to give perfect satisfaction as to quality, but can be sold
                                cheaper-than the foreign leathers.</p>
                            <p>The manufacturers of the United States are completely protected by a
                                high tariff, which even to-day taxes German leather 20 to 35 per
                                cent. If the Americans would reduce this duty, it would yet be
                                possible for Germany to take up again the export of some of her very
                                fine and light leathers, and such goods as this country has natural
                                advantages for making in her line raw material and cheap labor, and
                                in the manufacture of which machinery is but little used.</p>
                            <p>There exists a bad feeling among our leather manufacturers on account
                                of the high American tariff, and although the export of heavy upper
                                leather is lost to us, yet it might be that with a reduction of the
                                United States duty we might be able to regain some of our export in
                                lighter stock. For this reason it is desirable that America should
                                reduce her tariff to the level of that of this country, the more so
                                as the States are flooding us with their hemlock, oak, sole, and all
                                sorts of heavy upper-leather for shoe, carriage, and harness
                                manufactures, all of which enter under a tariff of 3 to 5 per cent.,
                                while America, as stated, keeps hers at 20 to 35 per cent.</p>
                            <p>The statistics of exports from the United States show an immense
                                quantity of leather shipped regularly to this country, and it is my
                                opinion that nothing can prevent the increase of this trade so long
                                as Germany does not raise her tariff. It seems to me, therefore,
                                that it would be to the interest of the United States to reduce the
                                present tariff to a level with that of this country.</p>

                            <p>In the United States there is hardly one branch of industry that is
                                more favored by natural advantages than the fabrication of leather.
                                The country produces the largest <pb facs="0795" n="61"
                                    xml:id="pg_61"/> quantity of hides’ and skins, and of the best
                                quality. The production of bullock-skins, for instance, is so
                                considerable that the country needs but one-third of the product for
                                its own use.</p>
                            <p>The second important factor in the fabrication of leather is the
                                tanning material. There is no country in the world that is as rich
                                in such material as the United States. The quality of the different
                                kinds of barks, and of the plants that contain tannin, is so
                                excellent that, in spite of the high freights for so cheap an
                                article, it competes effectually with its rivals in the European
                                market. We ourselves have imported American sumac via Bremen, and
                                oak-bark by way of Hamburg, although the freight was more than a
                                third of its value.</p>
                            <p>Hides and tanning-materials constitute the most that is wanted for
                                the fabrication of leather. The wages paid for making sole-leather
                                and upper-leather are of small importance compared with the value of
                                the article, and even if the cost of labor were 25 per cent. higher
                                in America than in Europe, this element would make a difference of
                                only 1 per cent. in the value of the leather.</p>
                            <p>These facts show, we think, that no country has advantages superior
                                to America for this branch of industry. Why is it, then, that the
                                American tanners want so much time to take advantage of their
                                favorable situation? Why has American leather been exported to
                                England, France, and Germany only within recent years? The answer
                                is, because the tariffs are too high. The fabrication of
                                sole-leather, and of common upper-leather, is so simple that not
                                much intelligence or attention is necessary to produce a good
                                quality. But the American tanners have had no inducement to try to
                                reach higher scopes. They always found purchasers enough for an
                                inferior article. If the tariff were reduced, American leather would
                                soon grow better in quality and cheaper.</p>
                            <p>Finer leathers, especially such as are wanted for the fabrication of
                                pocket-books, are, in spite of the high duties imported into the
                                United States. This industry has greatly increased within a few
                                years. Women and children find an easy and compensating occupation
                                in making such wares. But the high duties make the material too
                                dear, and impede the industry. The American manufacturers want fine
                                leather for fine articles, but cannot get it in their own country.
                                They therefore get it from Europe, good and cheap; but before it
                                comes into their hands the duties have made it so costly that the
                                articles made from it cannot compete with those of other
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>Varnished calf-leathers, for boot-makers, are only used in small
                                pieces for borders of elegant ladies’ shoes, and although the high
                                tariff of 35 per cent. does not prevent their use, it makes the
                                manufactured article so dear as to lame the shoe industry and export
                                trade.</p>
                            <p>The European shoe manufacturers are behind the Americans in the use
                                of machines, and there is no doubt that the Americans would surpass
                                the Europeans in cheapness of the manufactured article if they could
                                get their material cheaply, and without duty, as the Europeans do.
                                The revenue derived from the tariff is no equivalent for the damage
                                inflicted upon this great branch of industry.</p>
                            <p>The cheap sole and upper leathers enable American shoemakers to
                                furnish half the world with their excellent article, but as long as
                                the finer articles are not as cheap as the European, Europe will not
                                take its supply of shoes from America.</p>

                            <p>I am sorry to see that the consul (at Frankfort-on-the-Main) thinks
                                of bringing the manufacturer into contact with the retail buyer. I
                                am sure it will not benefit American industry to import here by
                                samples. I hope the plan does not contemplate consignments. I know
                                from experience that no first-rate manufacturer will consign goods.
                                Consignation of goods is always the first step one takes when he
                                intends to run away.</p>
                            <p>What I have seen of American manufacturers has given me these
                                impressions, and they are more their ideas than mine. The better
                                class of them hate all retail business and let the business of
                                selling their goods go to the dealer. These conditions enable
                                first-rate responsible houses to take up the American import
                                trade.</p>
                            <p>How are the accounts to be settled which are brought about by an
                                exhibition? No firm, not even a German one, can, according to the
                                rule of commerce, pay for goods unless they are in its house. Must
                                the American manufacturer sell on credit? Where will his stability
                                remain when his accounts are scattered all over the country? I think
                                England has occasion to repent that she went into the retail
                                business-and so lost her hold on the wholesale trade. Through retail
                                selling, the English trade has lost its predominance. Every one
                                takes what he can get, and they cannot sell as cheap as formerly,
                                because the manufacturer must now keep up the appearance of a
                                merchant, <pb facs="0796" n="62" xml:id="pg_62"/> which costs money.
                                His time is so absorbed in mercantile transactions that he cannot
                                pay proper attention to his manufactures.</p>
                            <p>I think American industry will not be profited by this plan. I
                                acknowledge that the United States consuls do more for their
                                countrymen than the German consuls in the way of giving them useful
                                hints. But experience is required to find out what is wanted and
                                what is not.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the separate circular of the Department, which was issued
                            during the month of August last, referring to existing instructions
                            under the Revised Statutes and the Consular Regulations on the subject
                            of transmitting commercial information and statistics, and inviting
                            attention to another and more specific line of inquiry in the same
                            direction, with the view of enlarging the trade of the United States
                            with this country.</p>
                        <p>Many of the suggestions of the circular as to the present favorable
                            conjuncture of circumstances, growing out of the prevailing stagnation
                            in business, for making an effort to increase the market for American
                            productions and manufactures in Germany had already presented themselves
                            to my mind, and, for some time past, I have been pursuing the line of
                            investigation which has been indicated. But I must say at the outset
                            that my endeavors to procure information of the kind demanded by the
                            Department are beset with special difficulties and my opportunities of
                            doing efficient work of the sort are comparatively slender. This
                            consular district covers a large extent of territory, and comprises
                            within its limits all of the Thüringian States, which consist of ten
                            small duchies and principalities, having an area of about 3,300 square
                            miles (English) and a population of rather more than one million.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, no large centers of trade and population within my
                            district. Sonneberg, one of the busiest of the manufacturing towns in
                            the whole region, has only 7,300 inhabitants, as shown by the census of
                            1875, and Coburg, the third town in point of size within the territory
                            of my consulate, has a population numbering between 14,000 and 15,000.
                            The manufactures of china, glass, toys, and other wares which are
                            exported hence to the United States are carried on in the small towns
                            and isolated villages, which are situated in what is known as the
                            Thüringian Forest, and the intercommunication of the entire region
                            depends mainly upon the well-organized mail-coach service. The
                            intercourse of the people with the consulate is therefore principally
                            conducted through the post; and this circumstance makes it difficult to
                            obtain complete information upon many pointy which it is likely that
                            personal inquiry would enable me to secure.</p>
                        <p>From recent conversations with the more prominent merchants and
                            manufacturers in the immediate neighborhood, I have obtained, however,
                            some facts which bear upon that point of the Department’s circular which
                            instructs me to make an investigation as to whether the trade of the
                            United States with Germany might be increased by legislative action;
                            and, in acknowledging the receipt of the circular, I avail myself of the
                            occasion to lay before the Department at once the result of my inquiry
                            under this branch of the subject, as affording an indication <pb
                                facs="0797" n="63" xml:id="pg_63"/> of the conditions upon which, in
                            part, an enlarged trade between the two countries might be fostered and
                            gradually made more profitable.</p>
                        <p>There appears to be no question now in Germany as to the excellence of
                            various kinds of American productions, mechanism, and manufactures, and
                            as to the advantages which they possess over all others in the German
                            markets. The latest important public witness to this fact is a
                            profusely-illustrated volume of nearly 400 pages, which has only during
                            the present week been published at Berlin. Its author is Dr. Hermann
                            Grothe, of that city, a political economist of repute. The book is
                            entitled “Die Industrie Amerikas (Vereinigten Staaten von Nord Amerika),
                            ihre Geschichte, Entwickelung und Lage, unter besonderer
                            Berücksichtigung der Volkswirthschaft und Handelspolitik, der
                            Erfindungen und Fortschritte des Maschinenwesens, etc., und die
                            Weltausstellung zu Philadelphia.” From the preface to this interesting
                            work I take the liberty of translating the following paragraphs, which,
                            in my opinion, very truly express the views of all intelligent observers
                            regarding the present condition of the industries of the United States.
                            Dr. Grothe says: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    publications of every European nation shortly before the opening
                                    of the Philadelphia exhibition drew public attention more than
                                    ever before to the state of the industries of America. It was
                                    acknowledged that a development must have taken place on the
                                    other side of the ocean, of the magnitude of which Europe had
                                    been hitherto sadly ignorant, and of the value and peculiarities
                                    of which reports had suddenly appeared which sounded almost
                                    fabulous. Accustomed to connect American performances with the
                                    character of swindles, or, at least, to regard them as
                                    eccentricities, and to undervalue the intrinsic high worth of
                                    the American inventive faculty, the industrial states of Europe
                                    have now to confess that their previous suppositions in this
                                    regard were false, that their opinions were unfounded, and that
                                    their real knowledge of American industries was grossly inexact.
                                    The world’s exhibition at Philadelphia was an event of the
                                    highest advantage to Europe, inasmuch as it was calculated to
                                    draw energetic and expert men over the ocean to obtain by
                                    personal observation correct views of the condition of the
                                    industries of the United States and of their subsidiary aids.
                                    That most of the reports of these men sound as though they had
                                    discovered a new world is well known, and there is, indeed,
                                    spread out in America before the eyes of the observing European
                                    a new world of industry, with new forms, new methods of work and
                                    traffic, new auxiliaries, and under new aspects and
                                    conditions.</p>
                                <p>To me, also, this world on the other side of the ocean appeared
                                    new, although I was perfectly informed before my visit to the
                                    United States upon many branches of their industry and its
                                    development. I-was particularly induced to make the visit in
                                    order to study the principles which had operated so powerfully
                                    in bringing about this rapid and high development, and from a
                                    firm conviction that without a prompt and honest exposition of
                                    the condition and results of American industrial relations our
                                    German industries in future would suffer still more. As friendly
                                    to a moderate tariff, I was offered in America, the land of
                                    protection, the broadest field for investigation and study; and,
                                    with a grateful heart, I publish here the letter of
                                    recommendation which opened for me all the manufactories and
                                    workshops, and afforded me the opportunity of examining most
                                    thoroughly into the relations of employers and employed, as well
                                    as into their social and family life. * * * This journey through
                                    the industrial districts of America belongs to the most
                                    agreeable remembrances of my life.</p>
                                <p>Perhaps in the face of this exposition of my views it may be
                                    charged that my work has been written in the interest of the
                                    protectionist class; but the imputation would be wide of the
                                    truth. All American industrialists, with few exceptions indeed,
                                    are protectionists; but, for myself, I am far from indorsing the
                                    too high protective system of the United States, and I cherish
                                    the conviction that the system must be modified in accordance
                                    with the conditions of progress. Moreover, I rejoice to be able
                                    to say that this modification is already intended by the
                                    Americans themselves, who are taking the preliminary steps to
                                    this end. And I assert with emphasis that I have come to the
                                    same conclusions with regard to the development of American
                                    industry which have been reached by other German, Austrian,
                                    French, and Belgian commissioners who have formed a judgment in
                                    part from another politico-economical stand-point.</p>

                        <p>The object of Dr. Grothe’s book is to give a clear insight into the wide
                            field of American industries, in order that Europe may profit by our
                            experience. In the first part of the volume the history of the country
                            is <pb facs="0798" n="64" xml:id="pg_64"/> sketched, the various
                            influences which have affected its development are indicated, and its
                            present real strength and industrial condition are explained. Long
                            chapters are devoted to the auxiliaries which aid the industries of the
                            United States, and among these great importance is attached to the
                            stimulating effect of the patent laws, to the results of the protective
                            tariff, and to the advantages which grow out of our rich natural
                            productions and vast material resources. In the second part of the book
                            each prominent branch of industry is treated separately and thoroughly,
                            and the principal labor saving machines and inventions which have
                            contributed so greatly to the progress of the United States in all the
                            avenues of business are carefully described and illustrated.</p>
                        <p>But not by Dr. Grothe alone, but also by every person of observation and
                            practical experience, is the excellence of American wares, in a wide
                            range of manufactures, confessed. The superiority of our textile
                            fabrics, our hardware, our agricultural implements, our craftsmen’s
                            tools, our machinery, and of many classes of our useful and ornamental
                            fancy goods, is generally acknowledged. Their perfection in finish,
                            their durability, their ingenuity, their practical character, are some
                            of the qualities which commend them and which place them in favorable
                            contrast to the productions of other lands. Moreover, owing to the use
                            of labor-saving machinery and well-adapted tools, the cost of
                            manufacture, in spite of higher wages at home, is lessened to the point
                            where competition with other nations in supplying foreign markets may
                            fairly be tried; and there can be no doubt that a great many lines of
                            American wares will eventually find ready sale in the German market, in
                            some cases to the exclusion of the same classes of goods of English,
                            French, and even of home manufacture. All this is granted.</p>
                        <p>But it is the unanimous opinion of every one with whom I have conversed
                            on this subject that, before any great and profitable trade between the
                            two countries can be developed, the United States must take measures to
                            overcome an existing prejudice against the introduction of American
                            goods into Germany—a prejudice against these goods simply because they
                            are American goods, and in spite of the merits which they possess, and
                            which are freely admitted.</p>
                        <p>This prejudice undoubtedly exists, and, from all that I can learn, grows
                            stronger every day. It is caused by our high tariff, which, while it has
                            fostered our own industries, has had the effect, it is argued, of
                            closing our own markets to many lines of German manufactured goods. I am
                            informed that, as a matter of principle, some merchants have absolutely
                            determined to use every influence at their command against the
                            introduction of American manufactures at present and until such time as
                            an active disposition shall be manifested by ourselves toward some sort
                            of reciprocity in tariff matters.</p>
                        <p>This question of getting us to reduce our tariff, or else of bringing so
                            great pressure to bear upon the imperial government that the tariff of
                            Germany shall be so revised as to discriminate against us, as France
                            does, is now, I am told, and has been for some time past, receiving
                            attention in the various chambers of commerce throughout the country.
                            Certainly it is a fruitful theme of discussion at every center of trade,
                            and the proper measures for securing some sort of relief are often
                            excitedly canvassed. I have myself heard many arguments on the subject,
                            the tenor of which was that while we might well be excused as a nation
                            for having fourteen years ago adopted a high protective tariff in order,
                            that the exigencies resulting from our civil war might be met, yet we
                            were now in a position to show some degree of comity toward other
                            countries, by reducing our tariff on certain articles the import of
                            which <pb facs="0799" n="65" xml:id="pg_65"/> under the improved
                            conditions of our home industries would benefit others without injuring
                            ourselves. I think there can be no doubt that this feeling of
                            dissatisfaction with our tariff is wide-spread, and that at this
                            juncture it works strongly against the proper introduction of American
                            goods to the German markets, and, perhaps, to the markets of other
                            European countries.</p>
                        <p>In conversation a few days since with a gentleman here who is at the head
                            of one of the largest toy-importing and general commission houses in New
                            York, and who, as purchasing-partner for his firm and seller of many
                            lines of American manufactures all over Europe, has the very best
                            opportunity in his wide journeys, of learning mercantile opinion fully,
                            the foregoing general views upon this question were amply corroborated.
                            He said that the feeling at present in Germany against dealing in goods
                            of American manufacture was quite pronounced. Nobody pretended that the
                            wares were not superior of their kind, and well calculated, in times of
                            business prosperity, to win a market; but the continual argument is that
                            America is persistent in her ill-treatment of Germany in the matter of
                            tariff reciprocity, and no merchant will make a willing effort to push
                            an import trade with us as long as he can avoid it and until we show an
                            inclination to revise our tariff, and not persist in the gradual
                            shutting out of German goods from our markets. This is the report of a
                            merchant of great experience, and who has had fair success heretofore in
                            selling American goods in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
                        <p>It is likely enough that, if the condition of German industry in almost
                            every branch was not so depressed as it certainly is at present, the
                            unpleasant feeling which I have described would not exist, or, at any
                            rate, would not manifest itself so openly and so generally. But the
                            prospects of the manufacturing classes here seem to grow drearier every
                            year. No market can be found for goods of home production; there is
                            scarcity of profitable work; poverty increases, and there are many signs
                            of decadence which occasion lively concern.</p>
                        <p>Take the toy trade, with which this consulate has more particularly to
                            deal, as an example. One article after another which has heretofore
                            found ready sale in the United States totally disappears from the
                            invoices, because, under the nurturing influence of an import duty of 50
                            per cent. ad valorem, the production at home of certain grades of toys
                            has been so stimulated that” the manufacturers of this region can no
                            longer compete with it. All the cheaper sorts of wooden, tin, and
                            mechanical toys which formerly were sent hence to the United States in
                            large quantities are now made in America, and the market is now closed
                            to this kind of Sonneberg merchandise. And the same may likewise be said
                            of another important industry of this neighborhood, glass ornaments for
                            Christmas-trees. The duty of 40 per cent. has destroyed the trade with
                            the United States. It is said that goods of this grade can now be
                            manufactured cheaper and better in America than here. But this assertion
                            is denied by the producers at Sonneberg, who say that they were
                            compelled by the high tariff to make flimsy and unsubstantial toys in
                            order to get them into the American markets at all.</p>
                        <p>The people in this consular district are striving in every direction to
                            place their trade upon a more satisfactory basis, and as one means to
                            this end industrial exhibitions on a small scale are held from time to
                            time in different places. At these exhibitions not only are the
                            productions of the immediate neighborhood displayed, but also anything
                            and everything new which may serve to stimulate the inventive faculties
                            of the artisan class. At Sonnebarg, Ruhla, Waltershausen, and at other
                                <pb facs="0800" n="66" xml:id="pg_66"/> towns, exhibitions of this
                            character have been held within a few weeks past.</p>
                        <p>As bearing upon the question of the disadvantage under which the German
                            toy trade labors in connection with our own tariff, I have to make
                            mention of the proceedings which took place at Sonneberg last week,
                            under the auspices of the chamber of commerce of that town, in relation
                            to the threatened blow at this industry on the part of France. By the
                            terms of the commercial treaty between the two nations, which; is about
                            to expire, the duty upon German toys entering France is fixed at 10 per
                            cent. ad valorem. Under the new convention a specific duty is proposed
                            by France upon German toys at the rate of 30 francs per 100 kilograms
                            (220 pounds) upon common grades, and 60 francs per 100 kilograms upon
                            the better qualities; and France further proposes to increase the ad
                            valorem duty on glass and china marbles from 10 per cent. to 20 per
                            cent., and to exact a specific duty of 20 francs per 100 kilograms on
                            painted or decorated china-ware. Now, the lowest rate of duty proposed
                            by France on toys, 30 francs per 100 kilograms, is nearly four times
                            greater than heretofore. To avert the conclusion of a commercial treaty
                            on terms which would prove so disastrous to the German toy trade this
                            meeting was held at Sonneberg. About one hundred leading manufacturers
                            from all the region round assembled, and there were delegates present
                            also from the chambers of commerce of Chemnitz, Dresden, Nuremberg, and
                            Fürth. The impending danger to the trade was fully discussed, and I
                            gather from the speeches that prior to the existing treaty which is now
                            about to expire it was impossible for Germany to do a lively business
                            with France on account of the enormous specific duty of from 80 to 88
                            francs per 100 kilograms. Since the conclusion of the present treaty a
                            satisfactory trade had been carried on, and the exports had increased
                            from 106,000,000 marks in 1859 to 315,000,000 marks in 1874, while the
                            imports during the same period had augmented from 147,000,000 marks to
                            413,000,000 marks And now France was preparing a total revolution in
                            this favorable state of affairs, having taken the preliminary steps in
                            this direction in 1875. In that year the French minister for agriculture
                            and commerce issued a circular, in which the views of fifty-five
                            chambers of commerce and twenty-four other industrial and artistic
                            corporations were invited upon the question of making new commercial
                            treaties. The replies were almost unanimously in favor of renewing the
                            treaties and retaining the existing tariffs, with certain modifications,
                            but to substitute a specific for an ad valorem duty, as far as this
                            might be possible. It was said by the French chambers of commerce that
                            the benefits of commercial treaties were in the guarantees of stability
                            (which is a necessary condition of development and progress) which they
                            secured for both domestic and foreign industries, and that for better
                            obtaining this stability it was deemed advisable the
                            “most-favored-nation” clause, should be omitted from the new treaties.
                            To ad valorem duties the chambers raised the objection that they offer a
                            wider field for capricious valuation and actual fraud, and so are
                            injurious to honest business, and render impossible any degree of safety
                            in commercial calculations. In general, the existing tariff rates were
                            approved; and, although the chambers favored specific duties, they did
                            not ask that the present rates should be changed, but simply that
                            another method of collecting them should be adopted.</p>
                        <p>Now that the matter is under discussion between the two governments, it
                            has seemed an appropriate time for German industrialists to urge that
                            the most favorable provisions in the new treaty shall be incorporated.
                            That the manufacturers of this consular district are alive to their
                            interests in this regard, the Sonneberg meeting was an evidence. It was
                                <pb facs="0801" n="67" xml:id="pg_67"/> alleged by the speakers that
                            the duties proposed by the French would be two or three times higher on
                            the average than heretofore, and perhaps even heavier, as nothing was
                            mentioned by the French Government in its propositions as to whether
                            duties were to be levied on gross or on net weight, which alone would
                            cause a variance of from 33 to 50 percent. It was also argued that the
                            gradation of goods into classes would admit of no end of chicanery,
                            which would probably result in finding that the duties upon the commoner
                            grades of toys would only exist upon paper.</p>
                        <p>One of the speakers, a member of the Imperial Parliament, said that
                            before 1870, and more particularly before 1866, the polymorphic
                            character of the German states, and the jealousy which existed between
                            Prussia and Austria, were a great hinderance to a sound customs policy,
                            but that now the united empire was in a condition to champion the wishes
                            of every branch of domestic industry when so doing would conduce to the
                            common weal. He animadverted upon the sharp conduct of the French
                            Government in having arranged its new tariff before it had given notice
                            of its desire to make a new commercial treaty with Germany. This course
                            had placed the latter country at a disadvantage in leaving it little
                            time for investigation and discussion of the proposed changes-He
                            advocated earnest appeals to the various state governments, the Imperial
                            Parliament, and the imperial chancery on the subject.</p>
                        <p>The proceedings closed with the passage of a series of resolutions in
                            substance as follows: <list>

                        <p>The further prosecution of the matter was intrusted to a special
                            committee, composed of members of the chambers of commerce of Chemnitz,
                            Nuremberg, and Sonneberg, with instructions to be vigilant and energetic
                            in securing the ends proposed.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that what I have written relates in a general way to the

                            which asks for suggestions as to the method by which trade between the
                            two countries may be increased by legislation.</p>
                        <p>In subsequent communications I hope to enter more into detail, not only
                            upon this point, but upon the others which the Department has brought to
                            my attention.</p>
                        <p>I shall continue to examine into the-subject, and shall acquaint the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch No. 235, under
                            date of the 5th instant, in which I endeavored, in a general way, to
                            give an idea of the prevailing opinion in this country that the commerce
                            between the United States and Germany can best be promoted by a
                            modification of our tariff, the high rates of which, it is argued, place
                            burdensome restrictions upon many branches of German industry and hamper
                            the lively exchange of natural products and manufactured goods between
                            the two countries, I have the honor to-day to present some further
                            information upon this phase of the subject in question.</p>
                        <p>Since my last dispatch to the Department was sent off, I have received a
                            number of letters from leading manufacturers and merchants of the
                            Sonneberg consular district in response to an inquiry which I had
                            recently addressed to them asking their views as to the best methods of
                            encouraging and developing trade between the United States and Germany.
                            My question was purposely framed in the simplest manner, in order to
                            avoid the slightest suggestion of leading the witnesses. I scarcely
                            looked for the striking unanimity which characterizes all the answers.
                            Without any exception, the responses concur in saying that our tariff
                            must be modified before business between the two nations can recover
                            from its existing languishing state and subsequently be increased to a
                            more satisfactory volume. The value of this agreement in belief consists
                            in the fact that it expresses the opinion of representative men in all
                            the prominent branches of industry of this region, who are separated
                            from each other by long distances; and the promptness with which I have
                            received the answers to my letters shows that there could have been no
                            conference between the writers as to the tenor of the replies.</p>
                        <p>I think it best to translate these letters for the information of the
                            Department, and to give in each case * * * the character of the business
                            which is carried on.</p>
                        <p>1. From Sonneberg (<hi rend="italic">toys</hi>): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Daring the past few years commerce everywhere has suffered under
                                    many hinderances, and the causes thereof have been much
                                    discussed and the methods of recovery therefrom have been
                                    greatly sought after. In Germany, after the overthrow of our
                                    hereditary enemy, an attempt was made to reach a measure of
                                    commercial prosperity which was before impossible, in
                                    consequence of the dread of the inevitable contest. But the
                                    spirit of enterprise was all too hopeful. Existing business
                                    establishments were unduly enlarged, and numbers of new ones
                                    were founded, joint-stock companies, which turned out mainly to
                                    be arrant swindles, were launched on every side; and after these
                                    baseless fabrics fell into ruin a long time was required to
                                    bring matters once more into quiet channels and to their proper
                                    poise. But it is now to be expected that the united and vigorous
                                    commercial policy of the empire will exert the best fostering
                                    and strengthening influences upon languishing business. At the
                                    present moment the Russo-Turkish war presses heavily upon our
                                    commercial interests, in spite of the fact that the opinion is
                                    general that the war will be confined to its present
                                    territory.</p>
                                <p>The negotiations between Germany and Austria on the new
                                    commercial treaty between the two nations approach completion,
                                    and it is rumored that Germany has obtained many important
                                    concessions. With the discussion of the rates of duty between
                                    Germany and France, with which country our present commercial
                                    treaty will soon expire, all the chambers of trade and industry
                                    in Germany are now busy, in order to bring their views and
                                    experience to the knowledge of the imperial government. With
                                    Russia, also, a country which, until now, it might be said, has
                                    followed a purely Exclusive policy, a commercial treaty will no
                                    doubt be concluded at the close of the war which will be
                                    commensurate with the interests of both countries, and Germany
                                    will certainly have to thank her united leardership for securing
                                    so satisfactory a desideratum.</p>

                                    mutual active business be established if the United States would
                                    recede from their present incongruous protective-tariff system,
                                    which is no longer adapted to existing commercial conditions,
                                    and adopt a more liberal customs policy. Should this not take
                                    place, the producing classes in Germany will find themselves
                                    compelled to strive for the introduction of a discriminating
                                    tariff against the United States. Otherwise merchandise from
                                    America will be introduced into Germany without the payment of
                                    any duty, or, at most, of a very small duty, and so seriously
                                    injure our domestic manufactures; while, on the other hand, our
                                    goods, in consequence of the high protective tariff of the
                                    United States will be supplanted more and more, and eventually
                                    be driven out of the American market.</p>
                                <p>Without reciprocity in this regard, commerce between Germany and
                                    the United States will never reach its legitimate development.
                                    Formerly, this reciprocity was not felt by us to be a necessity,
                                    because our cheap labor enabled the manufacturers of this
                                    country to secure a good market for their wares in the United
                                    States in spite of the heavy tariff. But now since labor-saving
                                    machinery is so generally used and goods are produced in bulk,
                                    the advantage of German cheap labor has proved illusory, and
                                    there must be reciprocity if the commerce between the two
                                    nations is not in future to be very seriously injured.</p>

                                    be done in large quantities, but, at the same time, does not
                                    affect the circulation of money, this effort of ours has the
                                    double advantage of not overcrowding the market and of keeping
                                    sufficient money in circulation. The cheapness of trashy goods
                                    misleads wholesale and retail dealers, entices people of slender
                                    means to purchase, and frightens the wealthier classes from
                                    buying. This cheapness, therefore, tends to keep money in the

                                    the poor. It sends money either into another channel of trade,
                                    or causes it to be locked up unproductively. The balefulness of
                                    overproduction in every branch of industry makes itself felt so
                                    heavily that it is not necessary to emphasize it further. The
                                    imposition of ad valorem duties by your government makes it

                                    specific duties from all kinds of merchandise. On articles of
                                    necessity, of course, a lower rate of duty should be imposed, in

                                    and Germany is to reduce the duties to the minimum upon the
                                    productions of both countries, to abolish a protective system,
                                    and, at most, adopt a revenue tariff. Upon such sound principles
                                    as these, commerce on both sides would develop to a profitable

                                <p>The present dullness of trade is partly to be attributed to the
                                    overproduction of former years, but principally to the
                                    unfavorable phase of political relations. As long as the latter,
                                    in general, are not radically improved and elucidated, commerce
                                    and industry, in my opinion, will not materially recover. And,
                                    on this account, I am not sanguine that any administrative
                                    measures which might be adopted would result in any
                                    commensurate, but only in moderate benefit. Any effort to
                                    promote the commerce between Germany and the United States, in
                                    my opinion, would earliest attain its object through a reduction
                                    of the American import duties. Without considering the fact that
                                    our exports of merchandise to the United States, in consequence
                                    of, the high tariff, must grow less every year, it is to be
                                    observed that the influence of the protective tariff in America
                                    constantly works in the direction of increasing the price of
                                    labor. As a result of this, it is extremely improbable that the
                                    manufactured goods of America can. successfully compete in the
                                    markets of the world with those of other lands, excepting, of
                                    course, those kinds which are produced through the agency of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Pursuing the line of inquiry suggested in
                            the separate Department dispatch, issued in August last, concerning the
                            best methods of judiciously fostering the trade of this country with the
                            United States, I have to add to the communications which I have already
                            had the honor to submit on this subject in my dispatches Nos. 235 and
                            236, the following information, which I have obtained from
                            unquestionable authority, on the matter of introducing American
                            manufactures to Germany and to Europe generally.</p>
                        <p>My informant has had large experience in the direction mentioned, and he
                            fully indorses the opinion which I have gleaned from various other
                            sources as to the existing prejudice against American goods simply
                            because they are American—a prejudice which has no sort of connection
                            with the merits of the commodities themselves, but which is simply based
                            upon the jealous feeling which our high protective tariff has
                            developed.</p>
                        <p>In spite, however, of this bias against our merchandise, my informant
                            believes that the cheapness and excellence of many kinds of American
                            wares would secure for them a good market in Europe, if only a more
                            prudent and sagacious course were followed by our manufacturers. He <pb
                                facs="0806" n="72" xml:id="pg_72"/> is confident from his own
                            experience that the tendency of our business, men is to push their goods
                            too strongly at the outset, and so overstock the markets. Instead of
                            being content with moderate and progressive sales, they commit this
                            error, which is certain to result in a fluctuating rather than in a
                            stable and satisfactory trade.</p>
                        <p>Several instances of this unwise policy were given, the business in
                            nickel goods, for example. There are a large number of articles made of
                            this metal which are neat and useful and low-priced, and, in fine, well
                            adapted to hold the European markets. Among this sort of goods,
                            mountings for harness, whips, and walking-sticks, and frames for
                            pocket-books and traveling-bags were mentioned. At one time the trade in
                            these articles was quite satisfactory, and it gave every promise of
                            being permanent. But the American manufacturers were not satisfied with
                            doing a moderate and gradually-increasing business. They sent commercial
                            travelers to Europe who sold this sort of goods to small dealers at
                            wholesale rates. The consequence of this eager pushing soon made itself
                            felt. There was one year of enormous sales, and then the business was
                            utterly spoiled by an overstocked market. The same lack of wisdom, it is
                            said, has characterized the manufacturers of jewelry. In this branch of
                            industry a large trade was at one time done, especially in the cheaper
                            varieties of imitation jet, enamel, and gold, comprising bracelets,
                            brooches, sleeve-buttons, medallions, pencil-cases, &amp;c. The taste
                            displayed in this kind of ware, its low price, and the novelty of many
                            of the articles, all helped to recommend it. But the manufacturers were
                            too eager to drive a large trade. They overstocked the market arid
                            killed their business.</p>
                        <p>Another instance was given of the course which an American clock-maker
                            pursued. My informant said that his house purchased clocks at the
                            factory in Connecticut for $1.50 to $1.65 each, according to the finish
                            and mounting. In the course of three months he sold in Germany, England,
                            and other European countries no less than fifteen thousand of these
                            clocks at prices which were perfectly satisfactory to seller and buyer.
                            But at the end of that time he ascertained that the manufacturer, in his
                            impetuous desire to make sales, had consigned large quantities of these
                            clocks to England, where they were sold at an average price of six
                            shillings each at retail; or something less, after the freight, charges,
                            and commissions had been borne, than my informant’s firm had paid at the
                            factory, at wholesale, for the 10,000 purchased in Connecticut. Of
                            course, the method which this manufacturer has followed will eventually
                            destroy what might have been a permanent trade.</p>
                        <p>Again, the manufacturers of fancy writing paper and envelopes, who get up
                            their goods in excellent taste, would make large and profitable sales in
                            Europe if they would show ordinary business shrewdness., I am told that
                            a combination exists among themselves by which each manufacturer is
                            bound to send all his surplus stock to a commission-house in New York.
                            From this commission-house large sales are made, ostensibly for the home
                            market, at much lower prices than those which known exporters are
                            required to pay at the factories. As a consequence it is asserted that
                            purchases are made at the New York house in an underhand way, and the
                            goods so bought are shipped to Europe, where they are sold at rates with
                            which open export purchasers cannot compete.</p>
                        <p>These are some of the errors which I am assured are committed by our
                            manufacturers. I feel it to be my duty to mention them in connection
                            with the demand which the Department has made upon me for information as
                            to the best way of improving our trade with Germany.</p>
                        <pb facs="0807" n="73" xml:id="pg_73"/>
                        <p>These mistakes might be remedied, perhaps, if our manufacturers would
                            place their goods in the hands of a competent agent in each large
                            European city. In this way they might succeed in establishing a regular
                            and profitable business, instead of rapidly oversupplying the markets
                            and afterward laboring under the disadvantages of dull sales and an
                            uncertain demand.</p>
                        <p>Having thus described what are said to be some of the obstacles at
                            present existing in the way of a flourishing trade, I am very glad to
                            close this dispatch with a word or two of a more agreeable nature. I am
                            told that American mechanical toys would sell well in continental Europe
                            if they were more finely finished, even though the cost were a little
                            increased on that account. Of the ingenuity of these toys there is no
                            question, but they fail to meet the esthetic demand for comeliness and
                            perfection of shape. But, as it is, the American toys have materially
                            affected the export of certain classes of playthings hence to the United
                            States. They can, however, get a prompt and firm hold upon the markets
                            of continental Europe if an improvement takes place in the point which I
                            have indicated. Alphabet and picture blocks are no longer manufactured
                            here for the American market, because those made at home are better. The
                            only thing necessary to the satisfactory sale of this class of toys in
                            Germany and other countries of continental Europe is, that the pictures,
                            letters, and devices which appear upon the blocks shall conform to the
                            tastes and requirements of each nation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * Thanks, in part, to our Centennial
                            Exhibition, this year I am enabled to give a more encouraging report
                            than formerly respecting the importation of American products into this
                            part of Germany. As stated in former reports, I am unable to give
                            correct and full information as to the amount of the products of our
                            country consumed in this consular district, although I am satisfied it
                            is very considerable, and increasing from year to year. Recently, since
                            our great Philadelphia Exposition, it has become more manifest that our
                            export trade has been stimulated. Indeed, I feel that I cannot say too
                            much in praise of the results of that exhibition, from a patriotic
                            stand-point, and before closing this report I propose to refer to it
                            more at length.</p>
                        <p>Since Bavaria has no sea-port, most articles used here, coming from the
                            United States, are entered at the ports of Hamburg, Bremen, or
                            Rotterdam. The direct importations upon which there is no duty are
                            petroleum, wheat, lard, canned meats, fruits, Florida cedar-wood for
                            pencils, and all kinds of hardware, machinery, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">manufactured butter.</hi></p>
                        <p>There is one firm here that imports and consumes, annually, upward of a
                            half a million dollars’ worth of American lard, mostly Western and New
                            York refined, in manufacturing an article called “<hi rend="italic"
                                >schmalz</hi>,” or “cooking-butter,” <pb facs="0808" n="74"
                                xml:id="pg_74"/> which is substituted for and said to be an
                            improvement on the old article of German <hi rend="italic">schmalz</hi>,
                            made from poor butter and other ingredients. The new article, made from
                            lard and other fatty substances, after passing through some chemical
                            process, produces an article of a rich yellow color, resembling the best
                            quality of dairy butter. It is run into molds, and, when cooled off, is
                            stiff like the bars of common yellow soap. It is a. favorite article
                            with the German cooks, and is also used largely by the bakers and others
                            for shortening, and by the very poor as a substitute for butter, and, of
                            course, comes much cheaper. It is a profitable business to the
                            manufacturer.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">new imports of american
                            goods</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Although this city and many of her public buildings are lighted with gas,
                            in most private houses and workshops American petroleum is used, and the
                            amount consumed must be large. Also, within the past few months, we
                            notice many articles displayed in the shop-windows that were formerly
                            not to be seen, such, for instance, as the Chicago canned corned beef
                            and tongue, Oregon salmon, and other canned meats and fruits. Also white
                            goods (muslins), such as used for sheeting, shirting., &amp;c. One
                            establishment has a variety of cooking and other stoves from Detroit,
                            and some small machines and tools. I do not believe the sales have been
                            extensive, since, from early times, the tools used here have been of the
                            roughest and most primitive sort, and to be had at <hi rend="italic"
                                >very low prices</hi>. The latter fact is, and has always been, the
                            great desideratum. People here argue that their fathers prospered with
                            such old-fashioned implements, and that they should follow in the same
                            course, and so they will reason until they see that their neighbors are
                            thriving more who use labor-saving machines and modern tools. But this
                            will be only a question of time. I may here add that it is one of the
                            peculiarities or weaknesses of the genuine Nuremberger to keep as near
                            as possible to the medieval ages when the fame of their great artisans
                            was world-wide. The farmers of this country are mostly small tenants,
                            and cannot afford much outlay, and certainly will not indulge even in
                            seeming extravagance, so long as they cannot see immediate gain by so
                            doing, and, especially so long as human muscle, both male and female, is
                            so available and so cheap.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">successful introduction of american
                                machinery into germany</hi>.</p>
                        <p>In my annual report for 1873 I referred at length to the efforts of Mr.
                            Frederick Haag, a German-American citizen from Auburn, N. Y., to intro
                            duce American machinery, farming implements, &amp;c., into this his
                            native country. Before emigrating to America Mr. Haag had become a
                            practical mechanic and millwright. Therefore, in after years, having
                            become familiar with American tools and machinery, he conceived the idea
                            that he could successfully introduce into Germany our modern tools. He
                            took an especial fancy to a turbine water-wheel, known as the “Little
                            Giant turbine.” Mr. Haag knew full well that this article was just the
                            thing needed by the millers and manufacturers living upon the small
                            streams of his native kingdom of Bavaria, and that they were still using
                            the wheels of the pattern handed down by their remote ancestors. These
                            old wheels are the huge and awkward overshot and undershot, so unwieldy
                            and impracticable, and always erected upon the outside of the mill, not
                            only requiring much water, but liable to be useless the greater part of
                            the winter by being frozen up. Mr. Haag, having purchased <pb
                                facs="0809" n="75" xml:id="pg_75"/> the patent-right of this wheel
                            for the continent of Europe, came over with his two sons determined to
                            conquer the antipathy of this people to modern tools, and especially
                            their prejudice against our American patent-rights. When Mr. Haag first
                            appeared among the millers of Bavaria, some four or five years ago, with
                            his “Little Giant turbine,” and demonstrated to the miller its superior
                            merits, and the folly of longer continuing the things in use here, at
                            first, as he expected, he was met with sneers only; but, possessing
                            indomitable pluck and perseverance, and having full faith in his
                            ultimate triumph, he did not despair. However, before he could make any
                            progress, he was obliged to enter into bonds, as a guarantee that his
                            wheel would accomplish all that he represented. In every instance the
                            wheel proved a greater success than he had claimed. After a few turbines
                            had been placed in the mills their fame became great and a lucrative
                            business assured to the Messrs. Haag, who have already put in, with
                            perfect satisfaction, over four hundred wheels, most of them in Germany.
                            They have recently sold the patent-right for Austria, and the reports of
                            its success from there are also very cheering. The mills of the country
                            being generally very old and tottering concerns and unsuitable for the
                            times, the millers and others are calling upon the Messrs. Haag to build
                            them new ones, after American or modern plans. They have already built
                            157 grist and saw mills completely, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>,
                            everything about the establishment except the outer walls, besides doing
                            a great amount of repairing. In all these cases they contract to furnish
                            the material, machinery, mechanical labor, &amp;c. They have a large
                            field for future work in this line.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Haag at one time imported four dozen mowing machines and one hundred
                            dozen farming-forks, with handles complete. These took well; but the
                            turbine, growing so rapidly in favor, has monopolized the attention of
                            the Messrs. Haag to such an extent that they could not find other
                            business so promising or profitable.</p>
                        <p>I am of opinion that very many of our improved farming implements could
                            be imported here and disposed of at a good profit, provided the party or
                            agent introducing the same was a practical farmer who understood the
                            German language and character, and who had the combined merits of
                            patience, energy, and common sense. A native born German would be likely
                            to be the most successful. Also he should be capable and willing to
                            explain all particulars respecting his machine or tools, so that, if a
                            machine got broken or out of order, he could repair it, or be able to
                            show how it ought to be done.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that there has never been a machine introduced into this
                            country which will clean grain thoroughly, although there are several
                            kinds here. Mr. Haag says he tried to introduce a first-class machine
                            known as “a grain scourer and smut-separating machine,” which was one of
                            the best in use. Still, the price was regarded as so high that it was
                            impossible to sell it, when other parties delivered a machine for
                            one-half the money. He says it makes but little difference whether the
                            machine is first or second class, if it can be had at a low figure.</p>
                        <p>I have also heard that in some parts of the country American
                            manufacturers are running in opposition to each other in their prices,
                            which is having a detrimental effect; and the country is being
                            overstocked with mowers and reaping-machines, which have been exported
                            by most American companies manufacturing these articles to agents who
                            receive them on credit. Also the country is filled with such articles
                            from England, besides the imitation machines manufactured on the
                            continent.</p>
                        <p>It is presumed that a good agent will make more headway with a bad <pb
                                facs="0810" n="76" xml:id="pg_76"/> machine than a bad agent or
                            exhibitor can possibly do with a good one. To illustrate this, one
                            thoroughly competent agent of a mowing-machine told me that he came in
                            contact with another party representing an equally good American mower,
                            when he challenged the opposite party to a contest. The result was,
                            while No. 1 did the work in a most satisfactory way, the other was quite
                            the reverse. After selling his machine, and being satisfied that the
                            other mower was not at fault, and wishing to uphold the merits of all
                            American machines, he proposed that they change mowers and continue the
                            contest. This was done, and while he did equally as good work with the
                            other mower, the stupid representative of No. 2 not only did poorer work
                            than with his own mower, but badly injured the No. 1 machine. This
                            unfortunate exhibitor then confessed that he did not know his business.
                            Doubtless he was some pretender with good address, who wanted to travel
                            in Europe at the expense of some other people. As this was told me by a
                            responsible man, whom I well know, it fully confirms my idea that in
                            these matters, as in most others, “it requires the right man in the
                            right place.”</p>
                        <p>I can see no reason why our best farming-tools will not become more and
                            more in demand, since they are so great an improvement on those used in
                            this country, unless it be their seemingly extravagant price, which, as
                            before intimated, is a powerful obstacle in this immediate
                            neighborhood.</p>
                        <p>One great advantage our manufacturers have and will continue to have is
                            their superior wood for the tools and machines. Our incomparable hickory
                            and white-oak lumber is prized very highly in this country, where they
                            have nothing approaching the same, unless it be imported. Heretofore,
                            the best farming implements, such as forks, hoes, shovels, &amp;c., used
                            in Germany have been imported from England, and, I have heard it said,
                            sold under the name of “American tools.”</p>
                        <p>The great staple of agriculture in Bavaria is hops, which are cultivated
                            mainly by hand and cause a great amount of manual labor, and it has
                            occurred to me that our American cultivators might be introduced to
                            advantage, such, for instance, as are so indispensable in our large
                            cornfields and vineyards. Also our best cooking and other stoves. In
                            this connection I may mention that Dr. Seelhorst, secretary of the
                            industrial museum of this city, takes a very great interest in having
                            our excellent tools, &amp;c., introduced into Bavaria with the view of
                            placing better tools in the hands of the mechanics and other workmen of
                            this kingdom j that they may be better able to compete with the skilled
                            artisans of other nations. Dr. Seelhorst informs me that his museum has
                            appointed a firm in Philadelphia as its corresponding and purchasing
                            agents, with the object of furnishing the museum here with the most
                            improved hand-tools and labor-saving machinery for introduction into
                            Bavarian manufactories. The doctor having been a delegate from Bavaria
                            to our Centennial Exhibition, he became thoroughly impressed with the
                            idea that there must be a revolution for the better in the workshops of
                            this country. He brought home with him some of the finest specimens of
                            our mechanical tools, to be exhibited in the museum and in his lectures.
                            He informs me the museum has recently received a small order of $1,000
                            worth of articles, preparatory to larger orders. He thinks there are a
                            great many articles of our manufacture that can be successfully
                            introduced into this country. He mentioned such articles of hardware as
                            padlocks, door-locks, and door-knobs, which cannot be made here so
                            nicely and so cheaply, and very many other articles. He also referred to
                            the fact that there was no duty on such <pb facs="0811" n="77"
                                xml:id="pg_77"/> articles, except those that were nickeled and
                            otherwise ornamentally finished, and then it was bat 5 or 6 per
                            cent.</p>
                        <p>I may here say that I have had recently some correspondence with an
                            American citizen residing at Bayreuth, in this consulate, who was
                            formerly a resident of San Francisco. Two years ago this gentleman
                            thought he would try, as an experiment, the importation of American
                            muslins and other white goods into South Germany. He informs me that he
                            met with good success, and might have done still better if our exporters
                            would maintain fixed prices. He had made three different orders for
                            these goods, and each time the prices were raised on him; then he
                            stopped importing, and the prices went down again. He says the dealers
                            here will not buy unless they can have a guarantee that the cost prices
                            will have some stability; and he thinks it folly for our exporters to
                            send any muslin but of the very best. He is also of the opinion that
                            “Canton flannel” could be sold with much success here. He imported one
                            lot, which met with a ready sale. The substitute for this article used
                            here is not so good nor so cheap. He also thinks American leather could
                            be successfully introduced into Germany, although we import much fancy
                            leather from Germany and France.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">the philadelphia centennial
                                exhibition</hi>.</p>
                        <p>It gives me sincere pleasure to be able to bear testimony to the
                            beneficial effects of our late Centennial Exhibition, and, too, not only
                            from a commercial view, but from a <hi rend="italic">social</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">political</hi> stand-point. Owing, in part, to the
                            large emigration from Germany to America since it was first settled, the
                            sympathy and admiration for our country and people from the masses of
                            the people here have been strong and genuine. This was evinced in the
                            late war for the preservation of the Union. Notwithstanding this, it
                            cannot be denied that for a few years previous to the Philadelphia
                            Exhibition there had been a growing prejudice against our people and the
                            seemingly exaggerated stories of our wonderful progress, productions,
                            &amp;c. This was doubtless increased by the bad conduct of a few
                            unprincipled adventurers, who had come over to this country to place
                            swindling railroad bonds and other doubtful securities not negotiable in
                            the United States, and to otherwise impose upon the credulity of this
                            friendly people. Also, many of their own countrymen, who had left their
                            fatherland very poor and humble, subsequently returned, invested with
                            the new dignity and power of American citizenship and a superabundance
                            of this world’s goods; and, without regard to the time, place, or staid
                            customs of this people, were accustomed to indulge in swaggering,
                            boastful, and other unseemly conduct, so that when our really
                            meritorious citizens, such as merchants and mechanics, came here to
                            introduce their goods and inventions, they were obliged to encounter
                            more or less of this prejudice, and sometimes even obliged to listen to
                            such offensive words as “brag” and “swindle.”</p>
                        <p>Two years ago I felt an earnest desire that our then contemplated
                            Centennial Exhibition might be a successful one, and with that view I
                            called upon many of the best manufacturers here, who had exhibited their
                            goods two years before at the world’s fair at Vienna. I found that some
                            of them declined to exhibit at Philadelphia, representing that they had
                            made a losing business at Vienna, and intimated that they had not faith
                            in security from fire and otherwise if they sent their goods to
                            Philadelphia, to a city “where you have but few policemen and no army.”
                            (I may here remark, so ignorant were some of this people of our
                            republican institutions, that both myself and my colleague at Munich
                            were <pb facs="0812" n="78" xml:id="pg_78"/> applied to for appointments
                            on the Centennial Exhibition police, presumably by parties who thought
                            we had the power to assure them of such appointments, and who believed
                            it would be difficult for Philadelphia to furnish the proper material in
                            sufficient force.) Had the manufacturers and artisans of this country
                            been less timid, and could they have been assured beforehand of the
                            splendid success of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, it is
                            believed they would have made a more creditable display. In this
                            connection I may mention that the German commissioners, and very many of
                            the visitors from this country to our exhibition, were cultured and
                            enlightened gentlemen, who, since their return home, have written much
                            for publication, delivered lectures, &amp;c. and without an exception,
                            so far as I know, have been unstinted in their praise of our country and
                            our Centennial Exhibition. Notably among these gentlemen was Dr. George
                            Seelhorst, the secretary of the “Gewerb (industrial) Museum” of this
                            city. Dr. Seelhorst was one of the judges sent from Germany to the
                            Philadelphia Exhibition, and before returning to Bavaria he visited the
                            different industrial centers of our country, and returned enthusiastic
                            in his praise of our country and the success of her great exhibition of
                            1876. During the exhibition he purchased for his museum here a great
                            variety of specimens of the handiwork of different nations, especially
                            of our superior mechanical tools, &amp;c. During the last winter,
                            1876–’77, Dr. Seelhorst delivered a course of lectures in this and
                            twenty-seven cities of the kingdom of Barvaria upon the Philadelphia
                            exposition, and was very eloquent over the magnificent display made by
                            the different nations, and especially over the remarkable developments
                            our country has made during the first century of its existence. He
                            illustrated his lectures by exhibiting to his audiences specimen models
                            of our superior mechanical tools, miniature machines, &amp;c., and
                            pointed out their peculiar excellence. At the present time he is
                            occupied in writing an illustrated catalogue of the tools named, which
                            shall be sent throughout the country, without any cost, by the Nuremberg
                            Museum, in order to introduce these products into common use. The result
                            will be for the future to determine. I may here add, that at the request
                            of the German government, these lectures are to be continued through
                            this fall and coming winter, and the expenses of Dr. Seelhorst are borne
                            by the government. The tools excited the greatest admiration. The
                            learned doctor earnestly pressed upon his hearers the importance of
                            their shaking off their lethargy, and making the greatest possible
                            exertions in their different industries, if they would not be outdone by
                            all nations. He told his hearers that the United States of America
                            already outstripped most of the older nations except in matters of art,
                            and as art required time, America would eventually not be behind other
                            nations even in that.</p>
                        <p>Our exhibition gave us what we had so long needed, viz, an opportunity to
                            advertise our handiwork to the other nations of the world. I believe our
                            prospects are very flattering for an increase of trade with Germany,
                            though in this immediate neighborhood I think the greatest difficulty
                            will be the first introduction of our incomparable, although to this
                            people seemingly costly, productions. After they have once had a fair
                            trial, there will be no danger of our losing the foreign markets, and we
                            can reasonably expect increased demand from year to year; provided,
                            always, that our manufacturers do not rest on the laurels already won,
                            but continue to improve in the future as in the past.</p>
                        <p>It is well known that Dr. Reulaux, the president of the imperial German
                            commission at Philadelphia, made a report to his government, in which he
                            characterized the German display at our exhibition as “<hi rend="italic"
                                >billiaber schlecht</hi>” (cheap, but bad). I may here add, that Dr.
                            Seelhorst, in <pb facs="0813" n="79" xml:id="pg_79"/> his lectures,
                            substantially indorsed that report. At the time, this report of the
                            chief commissioner created a profound sensation throughout the German
                            Empire. It was a crushing blow to their overconfident exhibitors, and
                            could not have been tolerated from any other source. Time has made it
                            plain to all that Dr. Reulaux was correct, and it is to the credit of
                            the German manufacturers that this day they are looking the matter
                            squarely in the face, and their leading men are organizing industrial
                            societies and holding conferences all over the empire, and putting forth
                            their energies in order to place their productions upon a higher plane,
                            and, if possible, to secure greater prosperity for all their industrial
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>Socially, with foreign nations, I regard the results of the exhibition as
                            most gratifying; for, whether a person be officially or otherwise
                            residing abroad, it is pleasant to hear one’s country referred to in
                            such complimentary terms as are now heard in all circles, and the praise
                            is not the less agreeable because of its novelty.</p>
                        <p>Politically, all our countrymen cannot but be gratified that they are
                            citizens of the United States, now it is so much better known and
                            appreciated by foreign countries, and to know that the citizens of
                            empires and kingdoms have returned from our great Centennial Exhibition
                            and are telling their people of our capacity for self-government and of
                            the marvelous growth, prosperity, and future brilliant prospects of the
                            great republic.</p>

                        <p>In my opinion, American produce and its present decreased valuation are
                            not sufficiently known here, and a corroborating reason lies in the
                            military conditions of Germany and in their effect of absorbing vigorous
                            hands and increasing wages. Machines replacing and facilitating common
                            manual labor may therefore deserve attention at moderate prices; for
                            instance, agricultural machines, implements, manure and hay forks, axes,
                            hatchets, and other workmen’s tools, metal and wood working machinery,
                            or for similar specific purposes; then, in other respects, furniture,
                            glass-ware, jute, paper, carriages, harness-fittings, vehicles of
                            different kinds, leather in various sorts, fire-arms, locks, nails,
                            &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>As articles of importation from the United States, I may further name
                            under the head of victuals, in the first line, grains, and then meat,
                            fish, cheese, butter, fruit, and, almost as nourishment, tobacco.</p>
                        <p>After these premises, it may be as well to take first into consideration
                            the opposing elements that the most serious and well-meant endeavors to
                            raise the mutual intercourse are likely to meet with.</p>
                        <p>In latter years American trade has been materially checked in Germany <pb
                                facs="0814" n="80" xml:id="pg_80"/> by the importation of articles
                            of very inferior quality. I have cited some examples to Mr. Lee, the
                            consul-general at Frankfort-on-the-Main, whose views, I am happy to say,
                            are coinciding with my own in the essential questions of trade, and I
                            have not hesitated to mention to him that German manufacturers look with
                            an evil eye at importations from the United States, the more so as the
                            commercial policy of Germany has made a bold advance in matters of
                            import duties, and has relinquished the impost on wrought-iron and iron
                            machinery. If the United States were inclined to open their coast, as we
                            do, to free importation, such an idea would be hailed with pleasure,
                            but, as long as this is not the case, opposition will have its sway,
                            with an appearance of justice. Concerning the importation of American
                            goods, I am of opinion that a careful selection should take place not
                            only of merchandise, but also of the exporting houses. It will be
                            necessary, I believe, to invite only firms of undoubted respectability,
                            and, of course, waiving altogether the slightest notion of presumptuous
                            advice, I would beg leave to suggest that a call might issue from the
                            Department of State.</p>
                        <p>I deem it advisable to start with an exhibition solely containing
                            American goods, arranged in such a manner as to give a particular
                            survey, by means of samples, patterns, or models, as the case may be, of
                            the articles above alluded to at Berlin, Cologne, and
                            Frankfort-on-the-Main. There is a sort of affinity of the commercial
                            character of every commercial town—Berlin for the north, Cologne as the
                            key to the Rhine and center, Frankfort especially for the south of
                            Germany. Articles suiting one district may not suit the other, and <hi
                                rend="italic">vice versa</hi>. Frankfort might take the lead; Berlin
                            and Cologne follow in the track with branch exhibitions.</p>
                        <p>To carry out this idea, I think it would not be inappropriate, deferring,
                            however, to the better judgment of those actually residing in the United
                            States, if the Department of State invited the respectable trade, be
                            this by official or unofficial papers, or by “separate” circulars, or
                            privately by men of sound sense and high influence; and that the United
                            States consuls might be designated as being ready and willing to
                            facilitate and watch, as much as may be in their power, the first steps;
                            and that afterward the matter may be taken in hand and continued by the
                            merchants themselves. It seems not unlikely that, the ball being once
                            set in motion, the respectable traders will soon be induced to come
                            forward with their views as well as with their goods; and German houses
                            of good standing would, I doubt not, soon follow the example with their
                            home manufactures and natural products, textile fabrics, wines, mineral
                            water, and the like. I am well aware of such commercial relations
                            existing already in a great measure, but the object in view is to
                            increase them, to draw the connections closer, and to maintain a more
                            lively and continuous intercourse between the two nations.</p>
                        <p>I shall be glad of any instruction you may think proper to give me on
                            this subject.</p>
                        <p>I have, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my annual report on the
                            commercial condition of the United Kingdom, and to your circular marked
                            “Separate,” and dated August 16, 1877, desiring consuls to report from
                            time to time suggestions as to the method by which trade with the United
                            States may be judiciously fostered, I have the honor to forward copies
                            of leading articles from the London Times and Standard of December 10,
                            instant, on the excess of imports into the United Kingdom over exports;
                            and to suggest whether the anxiety indicated by these repeated
                            discussions on the part of British writers is not a proof that the
                            “excess” has deeper causes than they are willing to admit, causes which
                            may be in part owing to the advancement of United States manufactures
                            and other kindred interests.</p>
                        <p>I beg, also, referring more particularly to the circular previously
                            mentioned, to call attention to the portion of the Times’ article
                            referring to the United States, in which it is distinctly admitted that
                            American manufactures of “tools locomotive-engines, and many other kinds
                            of hardware” are now “obtained in Canada and Australia almost
                            exclusively from the United States;” while it is also stated that not
                            only do we produce at home almost all the manufactured goods we at one
                            time bought from England, but that we have been able to exclude British
                            manufactures from foreign markets.</p>
                        <p>In view of these admissions it may be thought advisable to direct the
                            attention of home manufacturers, especially of “tools,
                            locomotive-engines, and other kinds of hardware,” to the Canadian and
                            Australian markets.</p>

                            <p>The general depression of trade which has now prevailed for a
                                considerable period and the fact, to which attention has recently
                                been called in many quarters, that our imports have of late years
                                been exceeding our exports by an annually increasing amount, have
                                served, when taken together, to produce a certain degree of
                                apprehension with regard to the possible significance of these
                                circumstances as indications of waning national prosperity. In our
                                outer sheet on Friday there were published some figures, and some
                                inferences based upon them, which should be sufficient to show that,
                                although there may be much reason for caution, there is certainly no
                                ground for alarm; and the argument which was there stated may even
                                be pushed somewhat further with advantage. It must be conceded all
                                hands that the country was never more prosperous than during the
                                year 1872, and that this prosperity continued with little if any
                                abatement up to the end of 1874, although by that time the
                                increasing preponderance of our imports over our exports had become
                                well established. From 1873 to 1876 the value of our imports varied
                                only within a few millions, and, if we correct the official returns
                                by adding 10 per cent. to our exports on account of freights and
                                incidental charges, which are included in the estimate of the
                                imports, we shall find <pb facs="0816" n="82" xml:id="pg_82"/> that
                                the balance against us amounted to about twenty-nine millions in
                                1873, that it rose to forty-nine millions in 1874, to sixty-four
                                millions in 1875, to ninety-four millions in 1876, and that this
                                year, calculating the total upon the scale of the first ten months,
                                it can hardly be less than one hundred and twenty millions. It is
                                urged by alarmists that this increasing excess of imports means a
                                constantly increasing amount of debt to foreign countries—a debt
                                which can only be met by drawing upon our savings or investments at
                                home—and hence that we must every year become poorer by the amount
                                of the difference. To argue in this way is to assume, of course,
                                that our imports consist entirely of perishable commodities;
                                although it is quite conceivable that they may consist largely of
                                things which are not perishable, and which are bought as investments
                                for a portion of our surplus wealth. Among imports of this class may
                                be named works of art of various kinds, articles of taste or of <hi
                                    rend="italic">vertu</hi>, and many other things which will
                                readily suggest themselves; but it may, nevertheless, be conceded
                                that imports of the perishable class bear a considerable proportion
                                to the whole. The true explanation of the matter is that the excess
                                of our imports is a temporary condition, arising out of
                                circumstances which have disturbed the pre-existing course and
                                balance of trade, and which may eventually guide certain forms of
                                industry into new channels.</p>
                            <p>If we compare the condition of this country with that of our
                                principal competitors, and, in the first place, with that of France,
                                we find that the great bulk of French exports which come to us
                                consists of cereals, wine, fruit, and other products, the supply of
                                which is dependent upon a harvest, and that only by this condition
                                can the irregularities of the supply be fully explained. We, on the
                                contrary, export mainly such articles as coal, iron, and
                                manufactured goods; and it will be found on examination that the
                                reduction in the amount of such exports has been less in quantity
                                than in value. In order to produce the quantity nearly the same
                                number of hands, and nearly the same amount of capital, have been
                                employed as in former years; but the profits realized by the masters
                                and, although in a less degree, the wages received by the workmen
                                have both suffered diminution. Notwithstanding this, but possibly by
                                means of greater economy, the manufacturing classes have not only
                                lived, but have saved something out of their earnings, insomuch that
                                the sums paid to savings-banks have increased every year in spite of
                                the depression of trade. It must, however, be borne in mind that we
                                no longer possess monopolies which once were sources of great
                                profit. At the close of the great European war sixty years ago
                                England held a position of extraordinary and exceptional advantage.
                                Poor as compared with our present riches, we were yet far richer
                                than any continental nation, and our domestic institutions had
                                remained untouched. We were the first to make any large use of steam
                                power for manufacturing purposes, and we had coal and iron in
                                abundance at our feet. These advantages, turned to the best account
                                by the accumulated capital, the manufacturing experience, and the
                                superb energy of our population, placed England upon a pinnacle, of
                                greatness which made us at once the admiration and the envy of the
                                world. Aided by the start which we had thus gained in the race, we
                                pushed on for many years without interruption, and almost without
                                serious competition, until the close of the civil war in the United
                                States, when the Americans, who also have coal and iron, and
                                Anglo-Saxon energy, and who were relieved from the incubus of
                                slavery, began to strain every nerve to become a great manufacturing
                                nation. Having surrounded their country with a barrier of protective
                                duties, and being temporarily strengthened by a large immigration of
                                trained workmen from the old centers of industry, they applied
                                themselves to the improvement of machinery, and to the production at
                                home of almost all the manufactured goods which they had formerly
                                bought from us. In many departments they so far succeeded in
                                cheapening production—often, it must be admitted, at the cost both
                                of quality and of profit—that they have been enabled to exclude our
                                manufactures from foreign markets, and even from our own colonies, a
                                fact of which, perhaps, the best illustration is that Canada and
                                Australia obtain tools, locomotive-engines, and many other kinds of
                                hardware, almost entirely from the United States. Germany, again,
                                has come actively into competition with us, and has raised capital
                                in artificial ways for the establishment of factories which thus far
                                have met with considerable and well-merited success.</p>
                            <p>The facts are, therefore, that our manufacturers, within the last few
                                years, have been subjected to a previously unexampled amount of
                                competition, and to competition of a character which has required
                                all their knowledge and all their ingenuity to enable them to hold
                                their own. The immediate result has been a reduction of profits and
                                of wages, and this reduction, following upon a period of great
                                prosperity, which had produced among all classes, and especially
                                among the workingmen, a highly increased degree of luxury of living,
                                became a source of almost angry surprise to those who were the first
                                to suffer from its effects. The operatives, feeling the pinch and
                                ignorant of its causes were too often persuaded by professional
                                agitators to engage in strikes, which, in so far as they became
                                sources of embarrassment to masters, still further increased the
                                difficulties against which they had to contend. Competition led,
                                naturally, in the first instance, to overproduction, since many
                                makers were pouring goods into <pb facs="0817" n="83" xml:id="pg_83"
                                /> the markets which a smaller number had previously supplied, and
                                the expectation of war led to the curtailment even of customary
                                demands. England has been compelled to sell less, or to sell at
                                lower and scarcely remunerative prices, but has been unable to
                                import less food than formerly; and it is for these reasons mainly
                                that the balance has for a time been so much against us. As we
                                showed on Friday, the amount of the deficit, if so it may be called,
                                is utterly insignificant when compared with the entire trade of the
                                country, and it has not prevented the steady increase of
                                accumulations at home. We must not forget, however, that a
                                considerable part of these accumulations, such as houses, furniture,
                                plant, and so forth, has no available value in competition with
                                foreign countries, and that their value at home depends absolutely
                                upon the trade profits which enable us to obtain and to enjoy them.
                                The true interpretation of the facts around us is that we are
                                witnessing a great change or displacement of some of the conditions
                                under which the results of certain farms of industry have hitherto
                                been produced or distributed, and that we must wait patiently for
                                the readjustment which time cannot fail to bring. We are even now
                                suffering less than any of our neighbors or rivals, because we have
                                a larger accumulated capital, and are, therefore, better able to
                                work for a time at a diminished rate of profit. We retain,
                                absolutely, if not relatively, all our former advantages, and, as
                                soon as peace is re-established, and the excess of manufactured
                                goods now existing has been cleared away, there can be no doubt that
                                we shall once more enjoy our full share of the world’s prosperity.
                                Much of the competition against which we have to contend is even now
                                spasmodic and self-destructive; and, when some of our rivals have
                                ruined each other in their determination to undersell us, we shall
                                still possess the capital, the knowledge, and the energy which
                                helped to give us our old pre-eminence, and these will have ample
                                scope under a constitution which combines the most abs olute
                                stability with the largest possible measure of individual freedom.
                                The only shadow in our path is cast by that increased luxury of
                                living, in all classes, which militates so powerfully against the
                                accumulation of wealth by saving; and it is much to be wished that
                                those among us whose acts are accepted as examples would seriously
                                consider whether it would not be possible for them to set a fashion
                                of economy. There are but few families in which expenditure might
                                not be curtailed without diminution of enjoyment, and the nation at
                                large would be at once richer and better for the change.</p>

                            <p>The extraordinary rate at which the excess of our imports over our
                                exports has increased during the past four years has naturally been
                                exciting of late much attention, and not a little uneasiness. It is
                                no new thing indeed to find the value of our purchases from the
                                outside world surpassing that of our sales to it. The phenomenon has
                                long been constant and progressing, and since the beginning of the
                                present depression of trade the difference between the two sides of
                                our commercial transactions has assumed a magnitude that alarms many
                                sober-minded business men. During the fifteen years ending with
                                1873, for example, the excess of the value of the imports over that
                                of the exports annually averaged £56,000,000; in 1874 it rose to
                                £72,000,000; at the end of the present year it will probably be not
                                much short of £142,000,000; that is to say, in the three years it
                                has increased some seventy millions. Explain the facts how we may,
                                these figures are indisputably startling. In a period of
                                exceptionally bad trade how have we afforded to augment so
                                enormously our consumption of foreign goods? Still more difficult to
                                answer is the question, how do we manage to pay for the hundred and
                                forty millions’ worth of commodities against which there are no
                                exports to set off? The first reply to be given to this latter query
                                is that the excess of imports is really not so large as it looks.
                                The value of the exports, as given in the Board of Trade returns, is
                                their value at the ports from which they are shipped. Before they
                                reach the foreign consumer, however, the cost of carriage across sea
                                will have to be added, as will also the marine insurance, and so
                                likewise will agents’ commissions and other charges. Speaking
                                generally, these additions to the cost of the goods are earned by
                                British ship-owners, underwriters, and agents. Therefore, the real
                                price received by this country for its exports is the declared value
                                    <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> the several charges enumerated
                                above. On the other hand, the value of the imports given in the
                                Board of Trade returns is their value when they have arrived in our
                                ports, and when, consequently the above charges have been earned. It
                                is a moderate estimate that three-fourths of these charges fall to
                                this country. Consequently, from the payment to be made by us to
                                foreigners there have to be deducted at least three-fourths of the
                                freights, insurance premiums, and agents commissions. How much these
                                various charges amount to there are no means of accurately
                                calculating. Some authorities estimate them at two hundred <pb
                                    facs="0818" n="84" xml:id="pg_84"/> millions; others think half
                                the sum too high. But, whatever the real amount, it is abundantly
                                evident that when they have been added to the one side and
                                subtracted from the other they leave the balance of our foreign
                                trade much more nearly even than at first sight would appear
                                possible from an inspection of the Board of Trade returns. Assuming,
                                however, that the imports really do exceed the exports in value to
                                some indeterminate extent, we come back to the question—How is the
                                excess paid for? As the payment has to be made to persons resident
                                abroad it must be sent out of this country in some shape or other,
                                or else it must be made by means of funds belonging to English
                                people, but held abroad. It plainly cannot have been sent out of the
                                country in the shape of bullion or goods, else it would appear among
                                the exports. Consequently, it must either have been transmitted by
                                means of which the Board of Trade takes no cognizance, or it must
                                have been effected by a transfer of British property abroad to
                                foreigners. Now, British ship-builders construct a large number of
                                ships every year for foreign governments and foreign ship-owners,
                                and the price of these ships, instead of being transmitted here,
                                might be paid over abroad to our foreign creditors without the
                                transaction ever appearing among the exports. Moreover, this country
                                has the largest carrying trade in the world, and the freights,
                                underwriting, and other charges earned might likewise be used to
                                settle debts abroad. Lastly, we have for generations been investing
                                capital in all sorts of undertakings all over the world. Many of
                                these investments have, indeed, been unfortunate, but the great
                                majority have proved profitable, and now return us annual interests
                                which in the aggregate must be immense. Here is one other mode of
                                payment which would not appear in the Board of Trade returns.
                                Persons owing money abroad need but buy from the ship-builders,
                                ship-owners, and investors the price of the ships they had built,
                                the freights they had earned, and the dividends that were accruing,
                                and they could settle their foreign debts by the mere transmission
                                of a bill, draft, or order.</p>
                            <p>We venture to think that the several funds we have now enumerated
                                more than suffice to discharge all our liabilities to foreign
                                countries. Such, however, is not the conclusion of many persons
                                whose opinions are entitled to great weight. Notably, Mr. Rathbone,
                                in a letter to the Economist which has attracted wide attention,
                                contends that they do not suffice, and argues, on the contrary, that
                                we are wasting our substance and using up our capital in paying for
                                consumable articles. To the objection that if so we should
                                experience a regular drain of gold, and should also witness a vast
                                increase of pauperism, Mr. Rathbone answers that exceptional
                                circumstances have prevented these results for the present, but
                                that, doubtless, we shall feel them before long. The exceptional
                                circumstances which so far have favored us are two. Every one who
                                gives any heed to the doings of the stock exchange is aware that, as
                                a nation, we have been exporting securities of late. For more than a
                                year we have been steadily selling Russian bonds to German, Dutch,
                                and French buyers. We have also been getting rid of Egyptians when
                                possible; and we have been disposing of a good deal of American
                                securities. Mr. Rathbone holds that the securities so exported have
                                been used to pay for our imports. Now, it is quite true that bonds
                                do, or at least ought to, bear interest, and, therefore, represent
                                capital. Yet it does not follow that if they are used to pay for
                                imports we are diminishing our capital. As a general rule the reason
                                why we are selling out our foreign securities is that they have
                                fallen into discredit in consequence of the repudiations of so many
                                governments and the apprehended difficulties of others. The holders,
                                that is to say the capitalists, are simply transferring heir capital
                                to some home undertaking in which they have more confidence. To
                                satisfy ourselves on the paint we have only to look at the
                                steadily-rising price of British railways. As a rule they yield now
                                only 4 per cent. where some years ago they returned 5 or even 6 per
                                cent. Equally marked is the upward movement in the value of houses.
                                As for the fact that the sold bonds are sometimes used to discharge
                                import liabilities, that simply proves that occasionally they can be
                                employed more conveniently than bills or bullion. The purchaser of
                                imports buys them with the money he owns, but the money is not
                                transmuted into capital because he puts it into a bond rather than
                                into a bill.</p>
                            <p>The second mode of payment to which Mr. Rathbone refers, no doubt has
                                also been made use of to a greater or less extent. Before the
                                opening of the Suez Canal a vast British capital was employed in
                                distributing the Eastern trade. British merchants bought tea in
                                China, coffee in Ceylon, cotton, indigo, and jute in India, and wool
                                in Australia, and brought these commodities home in British ships.
                                The Continental merchants and manufacturers came here then and
                                purchased the supplies they needed. The sums thus earned by our
                                countrymen, in the form of profits, commissions, and freights, were
                                very large. Since the opening of the Suez Canal, however, the
                                traders of France, Germany, Italy, and Austria find it more
                                economical to order the goods they require directly in India, China,
                                or Australia, and have them sent to themselves without British
                                intervention. Both time and money are thereby saved. The consequence
                                is that the large British capital formerly employed in this trade
                                has gradually been set free, and the general depression which
                                prevails, Mr. Rathbone contends, has prevented a new outlet being
                                found for it. Some of this, he goes on to argue, has been <pb
                                    facs="0819" n="85" xml:id="pg_85"/> used to pay tor imports, and
                                as thereat present exists no need for it in trade, the abstraction
                                has not been felt. Mr. Rathbone, however, fails to explain why
                                capitalists, because they are temporarily unable to find a
                                remunerative business, should proceed to consume their capitals.
                                Usually persons so circumstanced retrench instead of launching into
                                extravagance. Then, again, it is a poor assumption that no
                                profitable employment can be found for this capital. The Madras and
                                Bombay famine, to go no further, has been grappled with by British
                                enterprise. And the rapid growth of the cotton manufacture in
                                Bombay, of the jute Industry in Bengal, and of tea-cultivation in
                                Assam and Kumaon, is only possible because British capital is being
                                invested in them. It appears to us, then, that the honorable member
                                for Liverpool has entirely failed to make out his case. Indeed, it
                                might much more reasonably be argued that the excess of imports
                                which alarms him is a proof of chastened wisdom on the part of
                                capitalists, and a promise of greater prosperity in the future. In
                                the years before this excess reached its present proportions we were
                                lending recklessly to penniless governments and bankrupt trading
                                societies. The money we thus advanced enabled them to take large
                                exports from us but, as we have since learned to our cost, those
                                exports were really paid for out of our own pockets. Clearly it is,
                                not impoverishment to have stopped a trade of that nature.
                                Furthermore, the increase of imports is partly due to the same
                                distrust of foreign ventures. Capital which was unprofitably
                                employed abroad is being called home; some of it is coming in the
                                shape of bullion, some in that of goods, but in neither case is it
                                wasted or destroyed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch marked “Separate,” of date
                            August 16 last, was duly received by me on the 29th of that month, and
                            its receipt acknowledged on the same day.</p>
                        <p>It is well known to the Department that linen goods are largely
                            manufactured in Belfast and in other portions of this consular district,
                            and that these goods are largely exported to the United States. This
                            climate appears to be peculiarly adapted to the growth of flax, out of
                            which linen is produced. The climate is an exceedingly wet one, and this
                            aids greatly to the benefit of those engaged in bleaching the linens
                            after they have been manufactured. In many conversations which I have
                            had at various times with those engaged in the production of linen
                            goods, they have all expressed the hope that our government would,
                            before long, see its way clear to reduce the import duties on linen
                            fabrics. Now, as our people do not manufacture linens, it does appear to
                            me that it would be judicious if our government could make a reduction.
                            If it could do so I firmly believe that the government would add to its
                            revenues considerably, and this relaxation on our part would tend to
                            cause the people of this part of Ireland to import largely of our
                            agricultural implements and of our other manufactures.</p>
                        <p>The principal productions of our country imported into this part of
                            Ireland are wheat, Indian corn, petroleum, cheese, apples, canned fruits
                            of various kinds, plows, stoves, sewing-machines, canned vegetables of
                            various kinds, and bacon, and some beef. I am of opinion that if our
                            manufacturers would combine and send to this country suitable
                            representatives, they might, after a time, increase to a considerable
                            extent the demand for our various manufactures. I need not add,
                            scarcely, that all such representatives would receive from me all the
                            aid I could give them.</p>
                        <p>Nearly all of the large exporting manufacturers here have branch <pb
                                facs="0820" n="86" xml:id="pg_86"/> houses in either New York,

                            manufacturers do the same here?</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit, as directed, to your
                            Department, some observations relative to the expansion of trade from
                            the United States to Bristol, and also the fixed amounts of dock and
                            light-house dues to be paid on vessels entering this port and the port
                            at the consular dependency, Gloucester, to which I have attached a
                            statement of dues on vessels entering the new and commodious Avonmouth
                            docks, opened recently, and to which I have referred on former
                            occasions.</p>
                        <p>In the inclosed report I have also pointed out a mode how, according to
                            my opinion, American manufactured articles, having not yet found a
                            market here, could best be introduced into this country. If American
                            manufacturers or merchants would club together to establish permanent
                            “sample-rooms” in some of the important commercial places of Great
                            Britain, probably many articles of merchandise, besides those now
                            regularly shipped from the States to England, would find purchasers in
                            this country.</p>

                            <p>In the appended statement it may be seen what kind of articles
                                principally are exported from the United States into the port of
                                Bristol. As regards merchandise or goods manufactured in the States
                                which might advantageously be disposed of in the western markets of
                                England, besides those named in the statement referred to, I have
                                not yet been able to form an opinion. The merchants with whom I have
                                conversed relative to the introduction of articles manufactured in
                                the United States seemingly do not relish the idea of bringing
                                anything else into this market but agricultural produce, such things
                                as are required to suit the stomachs of the millions in this great
                                beehive of human industry. The opinion here is that English
                                manufactured articles ought to supply our markets, for which grain
                                and provisions should be taken in exchange. But as, according to the
                                natural law of trade, the man in quest of commodities buys where he
                                can purchase cheapest, it is not unlikely that, by proper
                                management, a number of articles now manufactured cheaper and better
                                in the States could be introduced here, and after a little time find
                                a ready sale. It appears to me that the most practical and efficient
                                way to do this would be for our manufacturers, <hi rend="italic">i.
                                    e</hi>., such as believe themselves to be able to compete with
                                the English industries, to establish in the principal market-places
                                of Great Britain “show-rooms,” where the different samples of such
                                articles as are intended to be sold here would be exhibited. A
                                trustworthy and efficient clerk, who might be controlled by the
                                consular officer of the district where such show-rooms of American
                                goods were on exhibit, if this were not against the rules and policy
                                of the State Department, could show to callers the samples and give
                                the American market prices. English goods of the same kind might be
                                    <pb facs="0821" n="87" xml:id="pg_87"/> exhibited alongside the
                                American articles, which at a glance would demonstrate the fact that
                                our manufacture excel now their European brethren in the production
                                of many articles calculated the comfort and well-being of the human
                                race. Besides the articles mentioned in annexed statement, “Yankee”
                                clocks from Connecticut, melodeons from Boston, some machinery for
                                the manufacture of tin-ware are imported now and then from States
                                into Bristol. Assorted wooden-ware, as buckets, wash-boards,
                                broom-have shoe-pegs, &amp;c., find now a steady and increased
                                import. Leather, used by trun<unclear/>, and sole-leather, also seem
                                to have here now entered upon quite a successful competition with
                                the English articles of this class. Hardware has, so far, not found
                                introduction into Bristol from United States ports, but, in my
                                opinion, a large number of mechanics’ tools could successfully
                                compete with the English in quality, adaptability, and price.
                                American bleached cotton of the finest quality al&amp;o is sold in
                                some retail-shops, but not imported direct from the States into
                                Bristol. In a future report I may be able to give the Department
                                some more information relative to the possibility of introducing new
                                American articles of merchandise into this country.</p>

                            <p>In response to the direction of the State Department, I have
                                carefully prepared the annexed statement of all dues, inclusive of
                                light-dues, exacted from every vessel, of whatever nationality, at
                                the port of Bristol. I also have adjoined the dues which have to be
                                paid by vessels discharging their cargoes at the new docks at
                                Avonmouth. As will be seen the charges are nearly the same at
                                both-mentioned places. No charges are made on taking in cargoes, and
                                vessels may remain in the Bristol port as long as it suits their
                                convenience without being liable to further charges than those
                                appearing in the statements below. The light-dues are lower in
                                Bristol than in any other port of Great Britain excepting
                                Cardiff.</p>

                            1877, I have the honor to report with regard to the export trade of this
                            district, that its present <pb facs="0824" n="90" xml:id="pg_90"/>
                            condition is anything but satisfactory to manufacturers here. Linens and
                            woolens being the chief articles of production, our duties have
                            effectually checked exportation to the United States, only a small
                            quantity of the very highest class of woolens, with somewhat more of the
                            cheaper stuffs, finding their way there.</p>
                        <p>From conversation with leading merchants here, I am justified in saying
                            that they have virtually abandoned the hope of ever again seeing their
                            manufactures exported in large quantities to the United States; they
                            also appear to have become indifferent about the requirements of the
                            American market. They further aver that a moderate reduction in the duty
                            on woolens would be of no effect in stimulating trade, but that to
                            produce any marked change the duty must be taken off entirely. This
                            convinces me that English manufacturers no longer monopolize the
                            manufacturing industry, because against our tariff and increasing
                            enterprise they have continued a hopeless struggle, until now they are
                            forced reluctantly to admit that even with a free entry they are not
                            certain that they could advantageously compete in America with the home
                            manufacturers.</p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly our tariff is the original cause of the decline in trade
                            here, but as that trade has been steadily decreasing with the same
                            tariff in force, it is evident that other causes are at work as well.
                            Frequent strikes here and an uncertain system of labor have aided in
                            increasing the cost of production throughout the kingdom. It is also
                            said that an American artisan will do twice as much work in a given time
                            as an English artisan, and that the workmanship itself is superior. This
                            will explain why the difference in the price of labor should not be
                            considered in any comparison of the productive resources of the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Again, during all this time the cost of production in the United States
                            has been gradually decreasing, and there has been a steady improvement
                            in the manufacturing industry. Whether the advances made are sufficient
                            to enable them to thrive without the aid of protection is matter of
                            conjecture.</p>
                        <p>But it is a fact that through American enterprise England has not only
                            lost her best customer, but that customer is competing with her in
                            India, Brazil, and other markets, and nothing is more certain than that
                            the Americans will never come back to this market. So that England has
                            not only lost an important market, but she has met with an active,
                            shrewd, and powerful competitor, which produces as well as
                            manufactures.</p>
                        <p>The subject how to regain their manufacturing superiority is the leading
                            topic with the newspapers and among all classes of people, but no one
                            has yet been able to suggest any feasible plan by which that object can
                            be accomplished. While the loss of prestige is often deplored they seem
                            to fold their arms in enforced impotency.</p>
                        <p>The difficulties of the situation are great, and the master-key cannot be
                            found, apparently.</p>
                        <p>The one dominant idea in England on free trade is gradually, though
                            surely, losing favor, and people are beginning to wonder if protection
                            may not, after all, be worthy of serious consideration. They are
                            disposed to regard protection less unfavorably than hitherto, since they
                            observe its beneficial influence in almost all other countries 5 and the
                            idea of government bounty to the manufacturers is being agitated. It is,
                            therefore, becoming painfully evident that something must be done, or
                            else the mainstay to the prosperity of this country is gone forever.
                            From such observations as it has been in my power to make, I am impelled
                            to the conclusion <pb facs="0825" n="91" xml:id="pg_91"/> that there is
                            no remedy, and by consequence British commercial interests must continue
                            to decline, and while I regret the prospect, yet I take consolation in
                            the knowledge that our country is destined to be inversely affected.</p>
                        <p>As before remarked, there are two sorts of woolens sent to the United
                            States. The finest kind, I am told, is for those consumers who must have
                            foreign goods at whatever price in cost and duty, while the other kind
                            is very cheap and pays only a small duty. But the total export is not
                            large and is annually decreasing.</p>
                        <p>The linen trade is likely to survive somewhat longer, because this branch
                            of industry being yet in its infancy in our country, the production is
                            much less than the demand. However, I notice the increasing demand for
                            jute and hemp machinery for the United States, and it is probable that
                            ere long we shall be able to supply our wants at home.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the importation of American goods is constantly on the
                            increase, not only of the staple products, but entirely new channels of
                            trade are being opened, with fair prospects of success. In a future
                            report I purpose to deal with the import trade.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent that the United States is destined to be the one country
                            on the whole globe where can be produced all the requirements of both
                            necessaries and luxuries, being dependent upon other countries for
                            nothing in exchange for surplus productions, so that there must be a
                            constant accumulation of wealth.</p>
                        <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to submit a preliminary
                            report upon the commercial interests of Ontario, in compliance with the
                            instructions contained in the Departmental circular of August last.</p>
                        <p>The close proximity of the province of Ontario to the United States,
                            forming, as it does, for all trade purposes, a State of the Union,
                            without exchange and with abundant and cheap avenues for commercial
                            operations, renders the commerce of the country almost identical with
                            that of the State of Michigan.</p>
                        <p>Drafts on New York can be purchased in Toronto as cheaply as in Chicago,
                            and banking facilities are as extended and intimate us the demands of
                            trade require.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the communications between this province and the States are
                            convenient and ample for all possible increase in the commerce between
                            the two countries for all time to come. Bounded on the entire southern
                            border by the great inland lakes and rivers, whose waters wash several
                            of the Middle and Northwestern States of the Union, cheap transportation
                            is thus forever secured for the staple productions of Ontario during
                            certain seasons of the year; and the fine railway system of the
                            province, comprising the Grand Trunk, Great Western, and Canada Southern
                            Railways, unite in making complete the spendid avenues, by water and
                            rail, over which the commerce of the country is cheaply and rapidly
                            moved.</p>
                        <pb facs="0826" n="92" xml:id="pg_92"/>
                        <p>There are three great staple productions in this province, viz, lumber,
                            wool, and barley, which, in the main, make up the exports.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">lumber.</hi></p>
                        <p>The vast pineries of Ontario are well known the world over, and the
                            supply is still ample for many years to come. It is true, however, that
                            lumbering operations each year become more and more difficult and
                            expensive, owing to the fact that the pine bordering on the river
                            bottoms and near navigable waters is being cleared off, and it is
                            consequently now more laborious and costly to get logs for the mills.
                            Notwithstanding this, vast areas of excellent pine-lands abound, and the
                            supply for a quarter of a century or more to come will be equal to the
                            probable demands for Canadian lumber in the sections of the United
                            States where it now finds a market.</p>
                        <p>The financial depression which has existed in the States since 1873 has
                            seriously affected the lumber trade of Ontario, because the principal
                            markets for the pine lumber manufactured here are found there.</p>
                        <p>Prices have ruled low and the production has been limited and, on the
                            whole, little profit has been realized during the past four years by
                            those who have been engaged in this industry.</p>
                        <p>A large majority of the lumber manufacturers are feeling more hopeful
                            over the future promise for increased prices and orders, but at present
                            the trade is not in as flourishing a condition as those embarked in it
                            desire to see.</p>
                        <p>Little need be said about the peculiarities of the lumber trade in this
                            connection, for the reason that enterprising Americans early made large
                            investments in the pine-lands of Ontario, and have for years been
                            engaged in manufacturing and exporting lumber.</p>
                        <p>Some of the finest mills in the country for manufacturing lumber were
                            designed and constructed by them, arid fitted up with machinery invented
                            in the States. In fact, in many instances the bulk of the machinery was
                            of American manufacture. The approximate value of the exportations of
                            pine lumber of all kinds from the province of Ontario, for the year
                            ending 30th September, 1876, was $2,652,906.43.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">wool.</hi></p>
                        <p>The wool grown in Ontario is an important article of commerce and a
                            source of great profit to the people. A large proportion of the clip
                            finds a ready market in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The combing wools of the province are a specialty, and are mainly used in
                            manufacturing American worsted goods in the Eastern States. It has been
                            found impossible to grow this long wool in hot climates, and for this
                            reason it always commands a high price.</p>
                        <p>The climate of Ontario appears to be well adapted for the Leicester and
                            Cotswold breed of sheep—the producers of the rare long-combing wools;
                            and every attempt thus far made in the Southern and central portion of
                            the United States to grow this wool by cross-breeding or importing has
                            failed. In some sections of one or two Northwestern States a fair
                            quality of this wool has been successfully cultivated, but the amount is
                            not large.</p>
                        <p>The combing wools of this province are of unusual length and quality, and
                            careful American buyers are always prompt in securing the choice clip,
                            paying excellent prices to the farmers for the same.</p>
                        <pb facs="0827" n="93" xml:id="pg_93"/>
                        <p>The annual production of wool in this province is yearly on the increase,
                            resulting from the gradual development of the country.</p>
                        <p>The average yield during the past three years has not been less than
                            6,000,000 pounds annually. At present only a small proportion of the
                            wool exported to the States is returned in the shape of manufactured
                            goods. However, with wool of unsurpassed quality near at hand, and, by
                            the aid of skilled labor and improved machinery, combined with
                            experience in manufacturing cloths suited especially for Canadian
                            markets, there is reason, to believe that, in the near future, much of
                            the wool now exported from this province to the United States will be
                            returned again from American manufacturers in the shape of cloths of
                            various descriptions.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">barley</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Canadian barley is famous for good qualities of weight and color, and
                            like lumberand wool finds its chief market in the States. For the
                            manufacture of pale or amber ales it is unrivaled, and for this reason
                            mainly, brings about ten cents per bushel more than American barley.</p>
                        <p>In Ontario this is a very valuable crop to farmers, and yet, owing to the
                            limited area in which it can be profitably grown, the annual yield does
                            not largely increase from year to year.</p>
                        <p>It is true that there is a comparatively large consumption of barley in
                            Ontario, but the great bulk of the crop raised here is exported.</p>
                        <p>As yet there is no market in Canada for American ales. Large importations
                            of English ale and porter are made, but the quantity is yearly becoming
                            less on account of the excellent quality of the ales manufactured in
                            this province, and it is not unreasonable to believe that in a very few
                            years little or none will be imported.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">lager beer</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Within the past two years there has been an extraordinary development of
                            the lager-beer trade in Ontario. This mild and popular beverage is now
                            rapidly coming into use, and promises to expel much of the intoxicating
                            liquors which are now sold here. Thus far, however, the quality
                            manufactured in Ontario does not compare favorably with the best
                            lager-beer manufactured in the States. For this reason it would seem
                            that an extensive trade in this article might be cultivated with this
                            province, from points where transportation is cheap and rapid.</p>
                        <p>Prominent manufacturers of this article in border cities contiguous to
                            Ontario, would do well to examine this opportunity of extending their
                            trade, for there can be no question but that an excellent opening exists
                            to introduce and secure a good market for the best quality of American
                            lager-beer in Ontario.</p>

                        <p>There is occasionally a surplus supply of wheat in Ontario, but the
                            amount exported is insignificant. The crop as a rule is barely
                            sufficient to supply the home consumption and often it does not do this,
                            even.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">peas</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The climate is peculiarly well adapted for raising peas, and American
                            seedsmen have large quantities grown here for seed purposes. The bug
                            which generally destroys this crop in the States does not injure it
                            here, hence the great demand for “seed peas” from Ontario.</p>

                        <p>Comment on this official statement is unnecessary, as it speaks for
                            itself, but the large balance in favor of American manufactures will
                            give general satisfaction to our people, and is conclusive evidence of
                            the increasing popularity of our goods in this market.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">manufacturing interests of
                                ontario</hi>.</p>
                        <p>No complete and accurate data are at hand from which minute statements
                            can be made up containing a detailed statement of the various
                            manufacturing establishments in this province. A general review,
                            therefore, will be given of the chief manufacturing industries which now
                            compete with American manufactures.</p>
                        <p>It can be truthfully stated in the outset, however, that the
                            manufacturing interests of Ontario are not generally as successful as
                            those having capital invested in them expected they would be when
                            established, Various reasons were given for this lack of success, among
                            which are, 1st, the heavy customs-duty of the United States, which
                            effectually shuts out their manufactures from American markets; 2d, the
                            circumscribed Canadian markets; and, 3d, the increasing popularity of
                            American goods. Doubtless these reasons are in the main good, as far as
                            they go; but Ontario is so situated that foreign manufactures can be
                            laid down cheaply everywhere, and agricultural interests largely engross
                            the attention and occupation of the people.</p>
                        <p>When the recent confederation of all the British North American Provinces
                            took place, under the belief that a new era of rapid development was to
                            follow, manufacturing enterprises were started to such an extent that,
                            failing to realize promptly all the benefits expected from the new
                            political relations, overproduction resulted, and failures and
                            disappointments were the chief fruits of this hopeful period.</p>
                        <p>It was found that trade has little sentiment, on this continent
                            especially, and also that small and isolated manufacturing
                            establishments cannot, as a rule, successfully compete with older and
                            larger enterprises of a similar character.</p>
                        <p>Experienced and skilled labor, developed in a long series of years in
                            great manufacturing centers, outrivals all comparatively small
                            competitors. This rule applies to Ontario; for recently American
                            manufactures have became popular on account of their superior style,
                            finish, and low cost. The charge has been made that American goods are
                            sold here at slaughter prices, <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>., below cost,
                            so as to close out surplus stocks. This, however, is not true in the
                            great majority of cases. Occasionally, no doubt, special lots are thus
                            disposed of, but this is a peculiarity of trade common in all
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The enterprise shown by American manufacturers in adopting new and
                            attractive styles, and in the use of labor saving machinery, combined
                            with great natural advantages for manufacturing cheaply, all contribute
                                <pb facs="0830" n="96" xml:id="pg_96"/> to the success which their
                            productions are meeting with in Ontario and elsewhere. Another and
                            perhaps the controlling reason for the rapidly growing trade in
                            American, manufactures is fully explained in another part of this
                            report.</p>
                        <p>I am now collecting statistics of all the manufacturing establishments in
                            this province, the quantity of the various articles turned out, and
                            their average wholesale prices.</p>
                        <p>The difficulties in the way of securing accurate and full lists are so
                            great, in the absence of any well-arranged statistics, that I shall be
                            compelled to embody the same in a supplemental report at a future
                            date.</p>
                        <p>I shall endeavor to make an exhibit of the industries of Ontario so
                            complete in its character that each industry will be carefully and fully
                            described and the average production of each establishment
                            explained.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">short-horn breeding</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The attention given to short-horn breeding by many of the leading
                            agriculturists of Ontario has very considerably increased the amount of
                            capital employed in this branch of agriculture during the past six
                            years. Large sums of money have been expended in importing rare animals
                            from the “old country,” and breeding of “short-horns” on an extensive
                            scale is now carried on with great success and profit.</p>
                        <p>The climate of Ontario appears to be admirably suited for the breeding of
                            short-horns, and there is little mortality from any cause among the
                            animals. The results are, healthy herds, fine development, and a small
                            percentage of losses by disease.</p>
                        <p>An extensive trade is carried on between Ontario and the United States in
                            short-horns, as well as in blooded sheep and pigs. American breeders
                            largely patronize the Ontario stock sales, and in turn many fine animals
                            are brought from the States into Canada.</p>
                        <p>The reciprocal trade relations which at present exist between the two
                            countries in fine blooded stock is mutually advantageous and tends to
                            develop a higher grade of stock in both countries.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">blooded stock</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The number of blooded animals for breeding purposes exported from Ontario
                            during the present year is larger than ever before. The law allowing
                            free entry to such stock as is designed solely for breeding purposes is,
                            doubtless, a very wise and just one. The rapidly increasing trade in the
                            best blooded animals proves conclusively that American farmers are fully
                            alive to the importance and value of the best stock that can be had, and
                            Ontario furnishes yearly additions to their rapidly increasing herds of
                            cattle and sheep, while rare breeds of pigs and horses find ready
                            purchasers in the States.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">horses, cattle, and sheep</hi>.</p>
                        <p>For many years the exportation of horses, cattle, and sheep from Ontario
                            into the United States has been very considerable annually. During the
                            late war immense numbers of Canadian horses were bought here for the
                            Northern Army, while the trade in cattle and sheep was immense. At
                            present, Canadian-draught-horses are much sought after for use in
                            American cities. Thousands of sheep are exported for our markets, while
                            the trade to England is insignificant. The exportation of Canadian
                            beef-cattle to England has been small, and the encouragement not
                            great.</p>

                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">general observations</hi>.</p>
                        <p>In reviewing the trade of Ontario it will be proper to call attention to
                            several subjects of more or less interest and importance to American
                            manufacturers, merchants, and economists. Perhaps the most cheering sign
                            of the times is the growing popularity among Canadians of American
                            manufactures. Former prejudices, mainly due to differences in political
                            opinions and foreign associations, are rapidly dying out, and, as a
                            consequence, large sales of American goods are now finding their way
                            into this country. Machinery, furniture, and fancy cotton goods are now
                            meeting with great favor. The demand is so great that Canadian
                            manufacturers are complaining loudly of the present Canadian tariff, and
                            clamoring for an increase in the import duties for the avowed purpose of
                            shutting out American goods. The present tariff averages about 17½ per
                            cent. <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi>, and yet so desirable are
                            American styles in manufactured articles generally that they can be
                            profitably exported to Ontario, and, after paying duty; compete with
                            native manufactures; This results from the superior style and finish, as
                            well as quality, of all cotton goods, and the neat, compact, and
                            ingenious character of manufactured articles in general. From being the
                            exception, American articles have become the rule, and now, in every
                            portion of this province, American dry-goods and manufactures are sold
                            in large quantities.</p>
                        <p>It is important, therefore, to all who are desirous of extending American
                            trade with Ontario that a full knowledge of the methods of doing
                            business should be obtained, in order that a safe course may be followed
                            in cultivating the same. As a basis, the following statement from the
                            annual circular of the Mercantile Agency may prove to be valuable:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The failures in Canada for the past two years number nearly
                                    4,000. At this rate (the number of traders being 50,000), every
                                    second business man in Canada may succeed in ten years. The
                                    gross liabilities of failed estates during the two years are
                                    over $50,000,000, a sum barely equaled by the entire exports of
                                    grain in that period.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This, of course, refers to the trade of the whole Dominion, but when the
                            fact that the total population of the country is a little short of
                            4,000,000 is considered, the enormous ratio of losses will be
                            self-evident proof of the unhealthy and uncertain state of financial
                            affairs generally.</p>
                        <p>A large proportion of the trade of the country is centered in Ontario,
                            and consequently the losses to foreign manufacturers and merchants are
                            very great. And yet, owing to the cash system which American dealers
                            with Ontario have adopted, in the main, a very small percentage of the
                            losses above referred to has fallen upon them. A gentleman of high
                            commercial standing in this province, and one of the ablest and foremost
                            merchants also, in a recent letter to the Manchester Courier (English)
                            gives it as his opinion, “that of the $50,000,000 of gross indebtedness
                            in insolvent estates, as referred to in this article, I venture to say
                            (and I don’t think I am wrong) that the American liabilities will not
                            exceed $600,000.”</p>
                        <p>Remarkable as this statement may appear, it is doubtless approximately
                            true, and this comes from the <hi rend="italic">short credit</hi> system
                            of American dealers. In the article in question the writer gives this
                            pertinent illustration: A Toronto wholesale merchant failed, in which
                            “the American trade bore a very fair proportion to its general
                            business,” and the “liabilities, direct and indirect, were about
                            $250,000, and of this amount the American liabilities were about
                            $2,000.”</p>
                        <p>The English system of giving extensive credits here has induced
                            overtrading in Ontario, and the evils of their long-time credits are now
                            engaging the attention of the best capitalists and merchants in the
                            province. <pb facs="0832" n="98" xml:id="pg_98"/> The only safe rule,
                            therefore, for Americans to adhere to in the future is to hold firmly to
                            the cash system.</p>
                        <p>Close prices and ready pay is the only sound system in selling goods to
                            Canadian merchants who are doing a long credit business with English
                            houses. And, moreover, Canadian merchants having got into the habit of
                            making cash or prompt payments for American manufactures they are
                            content to follow this plan. They get liberal credits in the “old
                            country” and arrange to “pay cash” for goods, &amp;c., purchased in the
                            States, and thus it happens that when failures overtake them the losses
                            fall almost wholly on the long credit adherents.</p>
                        <p>Nor is this all: many of the soundest business men in Ontario,
                            dissatisfied with the English credit system which encourages recruits in
                            the already overstocked wholesale trade, on small capital, prefer the
                            close cash dealing with Americans, and appeal to English dealers to put
                            on the brakes and adopt the cash system also.</p>
                        <p>As one deeply interested in the extension of American manufactures in
                            every legitimate way, the result of my experience has taught me that the
                            only wise way to extend our trade with the province, is to adhere
                            strictly to the sure and just cash system now in force. This alone will
                            bring about a healthy expansion, and at the same time secure
                            satisfactory results. A still stronger reason for such action may be
                            urged, and that is one of almost vital importance, and it is this: The
                            demoralizing credits made in England to Ontario merchants, without wise
                            discriminations, and in fact in many cases without any discrimination at
                            all, are leading the best of them to prefer purchasing goods in American
                            markets, because the cash system, rigidly adhered to there thus far,
                            makes it impossible for weak houses here to enter largely into
                            competition in American manufactures, and so they have the field to
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>This consideration has had a very marked influence in cultivating and
                            snaking popular the importation of American goods into this province.
                            And it is no doubt true that the gradual loss of trade to the English
                            manufacturers has, to a certain extent, induced them to go beyond a
                            prudent point in giving credits in the hope of regaining what the
                            Americans have won from them mainly through the popularity of their cash
                            system.</p>
                        <p>It will be seen, therefore, and for the reasons briefly stated, that
                            American manufacturers have only to continue in their wise policy of
                            cash payments to soon largely monopolize the very best trade in Ontario,
                            in all lines of goods in which a fair competition with English
                            manufactures can be maintained.</p>
                        <p>The lower rates at which money can be borrowed in England enables
                            manufacturers to hold a considerable percentage of profit in producing
                            their goods, but this is more than overbalanced by their unwise
                            long-credit system so that every consideration of safety and sound
                            business policy would seem to commend the wisdom of the present course
                            pursued by American manufacturers in rigidly maintaining the cash
                            system.</p>
                        <p>The employment of Canadian agents well acquainted with the trade of the
                            province, and men of the highest character who are familiar with the
                            methods of doing business here, and who have the full confidence of the
                            wholesale merchants, would be very beneficial. By doing this the natural
                            timidity of purchasers here would be more readily overcome, when
                            approached by agents for American goods, and also an intimate knowledge
                            of the financial standing of merchants would be of great value.</p>
                        <p>The Canadian system of “commercial agents” closely resembles that so
                            extensively employed in the United States. Some of the wealthiest <pb
                                facs="0833" n="99" xml:id="pg_99"/> and oldest houses in Ontario
                            employ no “runners” and disapprove of the custom. They claim that
                            constant importunities and special inducements made by persuasive agents
                            tend to demoralize trade, and encourage overpurchases. The credit system
                            here makes it possible for country merchants to order large stocks of
                            goods on long time, and in too many instances due caution is not
                            exercised in their purchases.</p>
                        <p>The commercial history of this system in Ontario is probably similar to
                            that across the border, but there is reason to believe that there is a
                            growing disposition among the most influential and leading wholesale
                            merchants here to gradually abolish this, to them, obnoxious feature of
                            trade in this province.</p>
                        <p>Communication with all parts of Ontario is now so easy and cheap that
                            country merchants can readily visit the chief centers of trade and
                            select such lines as are needed in their immediate localities. This fact
                            suggests the propriety of bringing American manufacturers and merchants
                            into confidential relations with the reliable wholesale merchants of
                            Ontario, and then to allow no sales to be made to the retail trade. The
                            reason for this will appear more clearly when it is known that country
                            merchants in Ontario, as the outgrowth of a long-established custom,
                            depend, in great measure, upon the credits which the wholesale dealers
                            grant them. If, therefore, American manufacturers sell small lots of
                            goods to retail dealers, even when prompt payments are made, the
                            tendency is to cut into the regular business of the wholesale merchants,
                            and ill feeling and dissatisfaction is the outgrowth of this policy. If,
                            on the other hand, the wholesale dealers in the United States confine
                            themselves exclusively to the wholesale trade in Ontario, the same
                            amount of goods will be sold and better relations will exist.</p>
                        <p>This point is one of more importance than many at first thought may
                            acknowledge, but frequent and forcible criticisms have convinced me of
                            its great weight. Those who do not fully agree with this observation
                            will do well to take a trip through the province, and carefully consult
                            the best authorities on this subject.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In compliance with instructions contained
                            in “separate” circular dated 16th August, 1877, I now have the honor of
                            forwarding such information I deem contemplated.</p>
                        <p>I find in use throughout this portion of Canada various kinds of
                            machinery of American manufacture, and a great increase in almost all
                            kinds of manufactured articles, particularly so in household-furniture,
                            stoves, hardware, table-cutlery, and cotton goods of the various
                            kinds.</p>
                        <p>In reference to the products of Canada in which trade might be increased,
                            I will give what seems to be the general feeling here in the commercial
                            community and also of persons crossing over here from the United States
                            for the purpose of making purchases of live-stock.</p>
                        <p>It seems to be a very general feeling that the duties imposed upon <pb
                                facs="0834" n="100" xml:id="pg_100"/> live-stock are greater than is
                            profitable to a healthy trade, by almost one-half; many sharing in the
                            belief that free reciprocity would be preferable.</p>
                        <p>In articles of breadstuff and other farinaceous food it is claimed that
                            the duty as now imposed is greater than they will bear, causing much to
                            be shipped directly to Europe which would naturally seek an outlet in
                            the United States if the rate of duty was reduced. This is especially
                            the case with oats, pease, rye, and wheat; pease and rye being almost
                            totally excluded from the American market by the duty as now
                            imposed.</p>

                            Department of State, dated August 16, 1877, containing instructions to
                            supplement the annual report upon commercial relations, hitherto
                            prescribed, by special communications as to the demand within this
                            consular district for different articles produced or manufactured in the
                            United States, and the probabilities of increasing the exchanges of such
                            articles for the products of Northwest British America.</p>
                        <p>The imports of this district for 1876–’77 from the United States were
                            double those from Great Britain, and exceeded by one-fourth the
                            importation from Eastern Canada, the totals of invoice values being:
                            United States, $808,332; Great Britain, $400,888; Canada, $662,489;
                            other countries, $5,600. The leading articles of the produce and

                        <p>While this country remained under the jurisdiction and administration of
                            the Hudson’s Bay Company the importation from Great Britain was about
                            the same as above stated, with an addition from the United States and
                            Canada which did not exceed $100,000. The United States collector at
                            Pembina reported in 1864 that the amount of goods from the United States
                            which passed that year into the Red River settlement was $45,457. This
                            amount increased twenty-fold in ten years.</p>
                        <p>The exports of this consular district show no similar increase. They
                            consist almost entirely of furs and buffalo-robes; the invoice values of
                            these articles in 1876–’77 being $660,785 to $35,186 of other exports.
                            Nine-tenths of the fur-trade continues in the hands of the Hudson’s Bay
                            Company, whose posts, from longitude 90° to the Rocky Mountains and from
                            the international frontier to the Arctic Ocean, are eighty-nine in
                            number. In prosperous years the company’s exportation of $500,000 of
                            furs (invoice values) would command $1,000,000 in Loudon or Leipsic
                            against an outfit valued in London at $300,000 and increased by
                            transportation and all other charges to $750,000. According to a
                            statement of the Hon. Edward Ellice, M. P., a director of the company,
                            in 1857 the net profits were $327,865. Ordinarily I estimate the return
                            as $250,000, although, as stated in my annual commercial report, the
                            company has declared no dividends for two years on account of the
                            unprecedented reduction in the prices of furs.</p>
                        <p>As indicated recently, the increase of the commerce of this district from
                            an aggregate of $1,000,000 in 1870 to $2,572,723 in 1877 is the result
                            of Canadian occupation and colonization, with a decided preponderance of
                            commercial advantage to the United States 5 and now that there is a
                            prospect of a considerable exportation of agricultural products from
                            Manitoba, I anticipate that the consumption of American manufactures
                            will be greatly enlarged. There will probably be a falling off in such
                            imports as animals, fire-wood, grain, flour, and meats as the <pb
                                facs="0836" n="102" xml:id="pg_102"/> country advances in
                            agriculture. But the general tendency will be to resort to the nearer
                            market of the United States for manufactured articles, unless repelled
                            by the exclusion of the great staples of Northwest British America.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the products of Northwest British America in which the trade
                            with the United States could be increased, I will first mention
                            buffalo-robes. While undressed furs are free of duty, dressed furs are
                            subject to 20 per cent. ad valorem, a rate very proper for furs dressed
                            or manufactured for use as luxuries, but which has been construed to
                            include buffalo-robes, an article necessary for comfort and of general
                            use among the people. The result has been to discourage importation, the
                            invoice values of buffalo-robes imported into the United States from
                            this consulate for 1876–’77 being only $614.12 against $72,578.20 sent
                            in bond to Canada. As the buffalo is disappearing from the Western
                            Territories of the United States, and will soon be concentrated on the
                            plains of British America, this branch of commerce might be greatly
                            enlarged by admitting buffalo-robes duty free or reducing the duty to 10
                            per cent. ad valorem.</p>
                        <p>With good crops in Manitoba for two years, there is a surplus of wheat
                            for export, and except for a duty of 20 cents per bushel, considerable
                            quantities would be in demand by Western farmers for seed-wheat. It is
                            well known that cereals reach their greatest perfection near the
                            northern limit of their successful growth, besides acquiring great
                            celerity of maturity, and as the price of wheat is regulated by the
                            foreign demand, no interest would suffer by placing wheat on the
                            free-list, and a material advantage would ensue to American
                            agriculturists.</p>
                        <p>I shall avail myself of the permission of the Department to pursue this
                            topic in subsequent communications.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your dispatch, marked “Separate,” dated August 16th
                            ultimo.</p>
                        <p>The matters to which you specially refer have engaged my attention, and I
                            avail myself of the opportunity which your inquiry affords to submit my
                            views as to the methods by which the trade of the United States with the
                            Bahamas might be improved.</p>
                        <p>Any statement which I make on this subject hereafter will refer
                            particularly to this colony, and not to the West Indies generally.</p>
                        <p>For a number of years these islands have suffered great commercial
                            depression. The causes for this are to some extent local, but may
                            chiefly be assigned to the heavy losses which have been sustained for
                            the last three or four years on the shipments of pineapples to the
                            United States and the almost total extinction of the former prosperous
                            salt-trade.</p>
                        <p>The local causes referred to are the gradual exhaustion of the
                            sponging-grounds, and a consequent decline in the value of the
                            sponge-trade; the closing of the Cuban coasts to the fishermen of these
                            islands, which, <pb facs="0837" n="103" xml:id="pg_103"/> previous to
                            the insurrection, they had a right to visit and utilize; the great
                            decrease in the number of wrecks and distressed vessels calling here for
                            repairs; the withdrawal of a large amount of capital by wealthy
                            inhabitants who have settled in the United States and England since the
                            rebellion; and, last, the heavy taxes imposed for the support of the
                            local government. The failure of some of these old industries has
                            induced enterprising citizens to introduce new ones; and last year sugar
                            and molasses were manufactured, for the first time since the abolition
                            of slavery, by machinery imported from the United States; and several
                            pine-apple-preserving factories were also established in different parts
                            of the colony. The farmers, too, encouraged and stimulated by the
                            governor, are turning their attention to the cultivation of vegetables
                            in large quantities for shipment to the United States. It is to be hoped
                            that these enterprises will prove successful.</p>
                        <p>Even now the Bahamas purchase largely from the United States, and are
                            entirely dependent upon the latter for nearly all of the necessaries of
                            life. The American imports are as follows, viz: all breadstuff’s, salt
                            provisions, tobacco, sugar, rope, paints, oils of all kind, liquors,
                            cured fish, canvas, a large quantity of boots and shoes, and, within the
                            last year, a small quantity of cotton goods and hardware.</p>
                        <p>Great Britain formerly supplied the Bahamas with manufactured goods and
                            hardware entirely, but the American articles, such as those lately
                            introduced, are growing in favor, and in the future will be largely
                            imported. It is acknowledged that in their patterns and finish they are
                            superior, for the price, to the English goods.</p>
                        <p>The exports of the Bahamas are fruits, sponges, salt, cotton, dye and
                            furniture woods, barks, shells, tortoise-shell, and wrecked merchandise;
                            the most valuable being fruits, and of these the United States receive
                            the largest share.</p>
                        <p>During the pine-apple shipping season, which has just closed, at least
                            one hundred and thirty cargoes were exported to the United States; these
                            being invoiced at about $150,000. This amount does not, however,
                            represent the net proceeds. For many reasons this is a most important
                            trade, and should, in the interest of American ship-owners, producers,
                            and manufacturers, be encouraged and fostered. During the past season
                            ninety voyages were made by American vessels in the conveyance of this
                            fruit to the ports of New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. The
                            freight-earnings of these vessels may be correctly estimated at
                            $100,000. In addition to this every dollar which these cargoes realized
                            was spent in the United States in the purchase of provisions and other
                            merchandise.</p>
                        <p>The season as a whole, however, resulted unprofitably to the producers
                            and exporters. Owing to decay on the voyage and low markets abroad the
                            fruit did not net in the United States what it cost here; consequently
                            about one-fifth of the crop was left to decay on the plants. This
                            unsatisfactory result has obtained for the past three or four years, and
                            the season just closed is considered no worse than its predecessors.</p>
                        <p>A considerable quantity of pine-apples were preserved at the factories
                            referred to, and exported to the United States. The machinery used— the
                            cans, cases, sugar, and other material—were imported from Baltimore, and
                            admitted here duty free. More than one-half of the expense incurred in
                            preserving was in the purchase of the articles mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The pine-apple industry is now the main-stay of this colony; it employs
                            the principal portion of the thrifty population, and a large amount of
                            capital, and, indeed, the future prosperity of these islands almost
                            entirely depends upon its success. A few more disastrous seasons will
                            probably ruin those engaged in it and necessitate its abandonment.</p>
                        <pb facs="0838" n="104" xml:id="pg_104"/>
                        <p>Taking into consideration the American interests which are involved in
                            its continuance, it is a question in my mind, which I submit, whether it
                            would not be judicious on the part of the government to reduce, if not
                            altogether repeal, the duty upon this perishable article. If this burden
                            be removed, I am of opinion that American producers and manufacturers
                            would be benefited to a greater extent than the revenue would suffer by
                            the change.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of salt I would state that, since the imposition of the
                            high duty on this article in the United States, the trade has almost
                            died out, and the salt-producing islands, with few exceptions, have
                            fallen into complete decay. At one time, salt promised to prove the most
                            valuable export of the Bahamas j in fact, so important was it, that, for
                            the convenience of shippers and for the protection of American commerce,
                            consular agents were appointed at nearly every salt-producing island in
                            this district.</p>
                        <p>There is still some trade, however, at Inagua, but even at this place the
                            salt-ponds are only partially worked. Formerly, the salt-islands
                            promised to do, and indeed did, a large direct import trade; now, that
                            trade is so insignificant that it is scarcely worth mentioning. Any
                            improvement which could be effected, however, in their salt-trade would
                            assuredly bring about an improvement in their import trade, and this the
                            United States would almost entirely monopolize. The only way by which
                            this improvement can be effected is by a repeal of the duty on salt in
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>The remarks respecting the salt-trade of this colony will apply with
                            equal force to the Turk’s Islands, which are included in this consular
                            district. These islands are naturally a part of the Bahamas, and have
                            identical interests, but some years since were made a separate
                            government. Their only industry is salt, of which, formerly, large
                            quantities were exported to the United States. There is still some trade
                            carried on, but nothing in comparison with that of former years. No
                            improvement can be expected in their condition and import trade unless
                            some impetus is given to their particular industry.</p>
                        <p>Of the remaining exports referred to, England receives the most valuable
                            portion. The trade with the two countries, both import and export, is
                            nearly equally divided; if there be any difference it is in favor of the
                            United States. Although this is the case now, yet I am of opinion that
                            if the like facilities were offered for the sale of Bahama produce in
                            the United States as in England, and the same profitable market could be
                            found, a large portion of that which is now shipped to the latter would
                            be diverted to the former. This would bring about a large increase in
                            the import trade with the United States, as the proceeds of this produce
                            would be eventually spent there in the purchase of merchandise instead
                            of in England as at present. Unless this is done, no important revival
                            of trade with the United States can be expected; the reverse must be
                            really the case, and the present business continue steadily to
                            decline.</p>
                        <p>The winter climate of the Bahamas is one of the finest in the world. In
                            consequence, various efforts have been made to establish the reputation
                            of Nassau as a sanitarium, with some success. With this idea in view and
                            to induce foreigners to invest their means in the erection of hotels,
                            and in the purchase of permanent abodes, an act has been lately passed
                            which allows aliens to hold real estate in their own names. I know of no
                            better way in which capital can be invested here, as the prospects of
                            Nassau as a resort are promising. With more frequent steam communication
                            and increased accommodations for visitors, a very great number <pb
                                facs="0839" n="105" xml:id="pg_105"/> of Americans would be induced
                            to spend their winters here. If this were the case the trade with the
                            United States would largely improve.</p>
                        <p>These islands are intimately connected with the United States in various
                            ways, such as their natural position, their present extensive import and
                            export trade, the fact that their mail and steam service is performed by
                            American vessels for which a heavy subsidy is paid by the Bahamas
                            Government, that large numbers of Americans visit Nassau every winter in
                            pursuit of health and pleasure, most of whom reside at a hotel kept by
                            Americans and in which American capital is invested.</p>
                        <p>In consequence of this intimate connection, there exists among the
                            inhabitants a strong feeling of sympathy toward, the United States,
                            which perhaps only needs the action of the government to make closer
                            still. Believing in the principle that the ties of common interest are
                            the strongest which can bind people together, I think that if by any
                            possible means the commercial relations of the Bahamas can be more
                            intimately allied to the United States, then the first steps toward
                            accomplishing the objects desired in your dispatch will be taken and
                            secured.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I have carefully noted your instructions, and will
                            transmit to the Department, from time to time, all information upon
                            these matters which come within the scope of your inquiries that is
                            possible for me to obtain.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I believe the receipt of the instruction
                            of the State Department, dated August 7, 1877, respecting the promotion
                            of the foreign commerce of the United States, which reached Rome while I
                            was absent on leave, was duly acknowledged by Mr. Wurts.</p>
                        <p>A full compliance with the instruction would require an examination of
                            details into which I have not yet been able to enter for want of the
                            official reports which contain them. I suppose, however, that the
                            consular answers to the instruction will furnish most of these details,
                            and that the public documents of the present session of the Italian
                            Parliament will supply additional information, which I may supplement
                            from other printed sources or by personal inquiries, and I hope to be
                            able to prepare, at a later day, a more complete report on the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, I beg leave to submit some observations on the general
                            aspects of the inquiry, as connected with the physical condition and the
                            financial policy of the United States and of Italy, respectively, and of
                            course with the needs and. the productive capacities of the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The United States and Italy are, in most respects geographical parallels
                            to each other, and, with the exception of our extreme northwestern
                            possessions, there is no important part of either country which in
                            natural adaptation to agricultural and industrial production does not
                            nearly correspond to some considerable part of the other. Every
                            vegetable <pb facs="0840" n="106" xml:id="pg_106"/> known to the
                            husbandry of Italy, every animal important to its industry or its
                            alimentation, can and is produced on American soil also; every mineral
                            yielded by the mines of our vast territory (which is more than thirty
                            times the extent of that of Italy) is found in greater or less abundance
                            in the various geological formations of the smaller state. The general
                            climatic mean of the two countries is not widely different, though the
                            extremes of temperature are considerably greater in the New World. The
                            annual amount of precipitation, so far as is known, does not vary
                            greatly in the inhabited regions of the two countries, but in Italy the
                            rain-fall is more confined to the winter months than on our Atlantic
                            slope, and the droughts of summer are not unfrequently seriously
                            injurious to the harvests. Hence irrigation is a very general necessity,
                            and the expense of securing and distributing water for the crops is one
                            of the heaviest burdens of the Italian farmer and one of the greatest
                            drawbacks to rural industry.</p>
                        <p>So far as vegetable products are concerned, it would seem, therefore,
                            that, upon the whole, neither country has much occasion to draw its
                            supply of such products from the other, and, in fact, with the exception
                            of cotton, there is no important vegetable growth which may not be
                            cultivated with too nearly equal advantage in both to render probable
                            any great future extension of commerce in such products.</p>
                        <p>But though the minerals of both countries comprise the same substances,
                            yet for geological reasons, and in part from exhaustion of ancient
                            mines, the useful as well as the precious metals are, in general, much
                            less abundantly furnished by the Italian mines than by ours. Our most
                            important advantage in dealing with ores, metals, and stones, lies in
                            the abundance and availability of the great sources of mechanical power,
                            coal and running water. Coal, indeed, exists in Italy; but the beds
                            appear to be, generally, of too small extent to be of much practical
                            value; and the forests are too nearly exhausted to furnish fuel for
                            important industries. In regard to the water-power, the mean of
                            precipitation in the Italian territory, so far as known, does not differ
                            greatly from that of the United States; and in mere amount the water
                            delivered to the sea by Italian rivers is sufficient to furnish a vast,
                            if not altogether adequate, supply of water tor mechanical purposes. But
                            from the fact that the great Lombardo-Venetian and Piedmontese plains
                            are bounded by steep mountains, and that the central ridge of the narrow
                            peninsula which constitutes the rest of the Italian continental
                            territory is almost equally precipitous, the courses of all the rivers,
                            except the Po, are short, and their flow is subject to what physical
                            geographers call the torrential régime; that is, their beds are
                            alternately almost dry and swollen by destructive inundations. It is
                            difficult to adapt machinery to the ever-varying level and ever-varying
                            volume of their currents, and still more so to secure hydraulic
                            constructions upon or near them against overthrow by floods. For these
                            reasons, and because a great proportion of the supply of the tributary
                            streams is diverted for irrigation, water power is comparatively
                            unavailable in Italy, and the country depends for its motive-power
                            mainly upon coal imported from abroad, at a cost beyond the reach of
                            mechanical establishments of moderate capital.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole, then, there are few agricultural and still fewer
                            industrial products in which Italy can enter into competition with the
                            United States on equal terms, and hence imported articles must be paid
                            for in some other way than by an exchange of commodities, and the
                            tendency of improvements in husbandry and in industrial processes is
                            rather to augment than to diminish the evils of this state of
                            things.</p>
                        <pb facs="0841" n="107" xml:id="pg_107"/>
                        <p>But the financial systems of the two countries oppose still more
                            formidable obstacles to any considerable extension of trade between
                            them. In Italy the internal taxes upon industry, its material and its
                            products, are such as greatly to discourage its prosecution, while on
                            the other hand the duties imposed by the American tariff system amount
                            almost to a prohibition of the importation of many Italian products, and
                            the trade between the United States and Italy is more likely to diminish
                            than to increase, unless, by mutual understanding between the two
                            countries, a remedy be provided. An international commission might be
                            able to suggest means of harmonizing the commercial and industrial
                            interests of both parties, and it might at least collect valuable
                            information on the commercial condition and needs of each. I am not
                            unaware of the objections to attempts to regulate such matters by
                            treaty, but at the moment I can suggest nothing better.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the recent circular-dispatch
                            of the Secretary of State, relating to the more active co-operation of
                            consuls in the further development of our foreign commerce, I beg leave,
                            with due reference to the instructions contained therein, to submit the
                            following partial report:</p>
                        <p>With the single exception of cotton fabrics, it is my opinion that
                            everything is being done that can profitably be done to develop the
                            direct commerce between this port and the United States.</p>
                        <p>There are in this city between thirty and forty merchants at present
                            engaged in this trade, several of whom devote their whole time and
                            energies to one special department of the same. Among the latter, a
                            member of an enterprising English firm has recently returned from
                            America, where he spent several months in studying the possibilities of
                            the petroleum-trade, with a view of extending the operations of the
                            company, which are already upon a large and extensive scale. Another of
                            our active business men, whose long residence both in the United States
                            and Italy renders him peculiarly fitted to the undertaking, visited the
                            Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia for the special purpose of
                            acquainting himself with all the recent improvements in manufactures and
                            the mechanic arts, bringing back with him trade-circulars, samples of
                            merchandise, and models of new inventions, with which he is now
                            traveling extensively, with a view of introducing them as far as
                            possible throughout Italy.</p>
                        <p>It will be readily understood by the Department that under such
                            circumstances, or where we have already a large and flourishing trade
                            vigorously prosecuted by a score or more of enterprising merchants who
                            are in constant communication with their correspondents by telegraph,
                            and who spare no time or expense in order to anticipate valuable
                            information, a consul with such decided odds against him will be able to
                            do but little more than to note the course of trade, and report
                            contemplated projects or accomplished results. Commerce is not only
                            Argus-eyed but lynx eyed, and commercial enterprise is ever on the <hi

                            returns. Besides, the very persons who would be able to give a consul
                            the most valuable information, are ordinarily not disposed to do so,
                            because they wish to enjoy a monopoly of whatever advantage is to be
                            gained thereby.</p>

                            case. It is true that Italian agriculture is still sufficiently
                            primitive.</p>
                        <p>The sickle and the flail maintain their old supremacy. Bun-colored oxen
                            slowly drag through the yielding soil antique plows whose model might
                            have been taken from the illustrated copy of Hesiod’s Works and Days.
                            Human feet, as if by way of Biblical illustration, tread the winepress;
                            while the olive-mill of the present day is still constructed upon the
                            model of those found amid the ruins of Stabiӕ and Pompeii.</p>
                        <p>The reason for all this appears obvious on reflection. Where the barriers
                            to the introduction of labor-saving machinery are not natural they are
                            artificial. The minute subdivision of the soil among the small landed
                            proprietors, or the still smaller leaseholding peasantry; the
                            rectangular garden-like plats of arable land or meadow, each intrenched
                            within its moat and picketed by rows of fruit-trees or forest-trees; the
                            vast, and complicated system of irrigation, as in Lombardy, with its
                            net-work of ditches and canals; these are some of the obstacles, to say
                            nothing of the opposition it would encounter on account of ancient
                            prejudices, that would render the introduction of agricultural machinery
                            into Italy on a large scale impracticable without such a radical change
                            in its system of agriculture as would transform the general features of
                            the country. But the hand of the laborer, which is the cheapest
                            machinery in the market, has fully compensated for any defects in
                            agricultural methods. It is this, in conjunction with a propitious
                            climate, that has made Lombardy the garden of Italy, and Italy the
                            garden of Europe.</p>

                        <p>I am credibly informed by those who have made the cotton-trade with this
                            country a study, that there are several varieties of cotton goods that
                            might be imported from the United States with advantage, provided that
                            they were adapted to the Italian market in regard to width and finish
                            and the prices reduced proportionally. Samples of the following goods
                            have been submitted for examination to the leading dealers in cotton
                            fabrics of this city, and pronounced to be well adapted <pb facs="0843"

                            and a corresponding reduction in price.</p>

                        <p>American cotton prints could compete successfully in this market, so far
                            as relates to prices; but they are not well adapted in style and design
                            to the Italian taste, nor are they printed sufficiently in advance of
                            the season. English manufacturers supplying this trade prepare their
                            designs six months in advance, print a few pieces and cut them up into
                            samples, which are sent out with a view of obtaining orders, the latter
                            being filled about three months in anticipation of the season. At
                            present, there is unfortunately among the Italians a prejudice in favor
                            of the heavily-sized English goods, which contain from 15 to 20 per
                            cent. of sizing. But this prejudice, if hot indulged, might be gradually
                            overcome.</p>
                        <p>To obtain their fair proportion of the Italian trade, American
                            manufacturers should acquaint themselves with the wants of the Italian
                            market, and manufacture goods of such dimensions and designs as are
                            suited to the Italian trade. To do so would requite time, patience, and
                            perseverance, and it might be necessary, in the introduction of their
                            fabrics, to incur a temporary loss; but these, owing to their superior
                            grade, must sooner or later commend themselves to general favor.</p>
                        <p>To give some idea of the extent of this trade, so far as the port of
                            Genoa is concerned, I subjoin the following statistics, gathered from
                            the report of the chamber of commerce for 1876: <table cols="2" rows="4">

                        <p>As Genoa controls the market of Northern Italy, it becomes a question for
                            the American exporter to determine whether the experiment of introducing
                            cotton fabrics of American manufacture is not worth a fair trial. In
                            view of the sharp competition, the margin of profits would be small. But
                            the order of the day is small profits and quick returns. The minimum
                            percentage of gain more than finds its compensation in the maximum
                            number of sales. A vulgar fraction now revolutionizes the commerce of
                            the world. Its immense cotton-trade lies within the range of one half a
                            cent per yard, and a grain of sizing turns the scales in favor of
                            Manchester of Lowell.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I may be permitted to express the opinion that, while
                            consuls, where we have not already a well-established trade, can do
                            much, Congress, by a judicious revision of the tariff, can undoubtedly
                            do morel In this respect our English rivals enjoy an immense advantage
                            over us. Not to speak of the freedom from restriction and taxation of
                            her mercantile marine, Great Britain taxes only the products and not the
                            implements or materials of industry, the results and not the operations
                            of labor. In other words, she taxes consumption and not production <pb
                                facs="0844" n="110" xml:id="pg_110"/> —consumption in its final
                            stages, and not in the processes of manufacture. Our present tariff
                            unfortunately does both, and not only once, but often twice. It is the
                            old story of killing the goose to anticipate the golden eggs.</p>

                            Majesty’s vice minister for foreign affairs, in which he fully agreed
                            with me that there was no reason why the chief exports of Japan—silk,
                            raw and manufactured, silkworm eggs, tea, and rice—to the value of about
                            $20,000,000 per annum, might not, with advantage to both countries, be
                            exchanged for American productions—cotton, raw and manufactured, wool
                            and woolen goods, and iron (manufactured), including tools, engines,
                            railroad, bar, and rod iron, nails, telegraph-wire, &amp;c.—all of which
                            are now imported into Japan from Europe, chiefly from Great Britain and
                            her possessions, to the value of from twenty-five to thirty million
                            dollars per annum. By the inclosed return of the foreign commerce and
                            trade of Japan for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1876 (the return for
                            1877 is not yet received), you will observe, on page 20, that the total
                            value of imports for that year was $25,743,114, of which imports (see
                            page 18) Great Britain and her possessions furnished, in value,
                            $15,000,000 in round numbers; France and China, $7,700,000, and the
                            United States only to the value of $1,800,000 in round numbers. You will
                            observe, on page 6, the import of cotton fabrics to the value of about
                            $7,000,000; the cotton first furnished by us to England, and by England
                            sent to Japan in cloth and thread. On page 7 you will note the value of
                            imported manufactured iron is about $7,000,000; and, on pages 8 and 9,
                            the value of woolen fabrics imported is estimated at about
                            $3,000,000.</p>
                        <p>Considering our proximity to Japan, and the fact that we can produce
                            these articles as abundantly and cheaply as England, by the ordinary
                            laws of trade we should have supplied Japan with these and other
                            productions, which we have in abundance. But we were induced to join
                            England in the convention of 1866, by which England sends her fabrics
                            free, or subject only to a nominal duty, to Japan; and aided by her
                            “gunboat policy,” as her journals call it, by her loans to Japan at high
                            interest, and by her large banking capital here of at least $12,000,000,
                            England has pushed the United States out of the market as by like
                            methods (some of her manufacturers appropriating and using our trade
                            marks), she has pushed us out of the trade with China. The trade of
                            Japan with the United States can be most judiciously and successfully
                            fostered, in my opinion, by restoring to Japan the rightful control of
                            her foreign commerce by a revision of our treaties, and there <pb
                                facs="0845" n="111" xml:id="pg_111"/> by compel the other treaty
                            powers to do the like, and also by acquainting this people that by
                            reason of our proximity and our manifold resources and surplus
                            productions we can furnish, as the fact is, all foreign manufactures and
                            products needed by the people of Japan for less than the same are now
                            furnished by the European States.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with your instructions I shall give this subject further
                            and full consideration. I may be pardoned for suggesting here what I
                            have before suggested to your honorable predecessor, that Japan is the
                            gate to the commerce of all Western nations with the East, and that, at
                            no distant day, if Japan and China continue to advance, they may, under
                            a just and wise policy, became the largest purchasers and consumers of
                            the surplus productions of the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Again referring to instruction “separate”
                            of date August 20, 1877, in relation to the methods by which our trade
                            with Japan may be judiciously fostered, I have the honor to report that
                            a few days since I had an interview with Mr. ——, an American now here in
                            the interests of our countrymen the Messrs. ———. Mr. ——— said to me that
                            a large market could be secured in Japan for our cotton productions by a
                            direct effort through intelligent agents sent hither by our
                            manufacturers and merchants for that purpose, but he added that the
                            trade cannot be secured to our country by mere written correspondence,
                            and that the Japanese dealers do not and will not go abroad to select
                            and purchase. He also said that the English watch <pb facs="0850"
                                n="116" xml:id="pg_116"/> this market closely, and send their agents
                            to reside here to introduce and dispose of their fabrics. He handed me a
                            memorandum, in which he shows the quality of cotton cloth and yarn which
                            might profitably, in his opinion, be introduced into Japan from the
                            United States, and which also shows the quality of cotton goods put off
                            upon the Japanese by England and to some extent the prices paid for the
                            worthless fabrics. I have the honor to inclose herewith for your
                            information a copy of the memorandum.</p>
                        <p>You will observe that it is stated in his memorandum that the gray
                            shirtings made for this market in England are of the poorest cotton
                            grown, and so light as to be of no practical value, and yet are sold at
                            from $1.40 to $2.10 per piece of seven or nine pounds, 39 or 45 inches
                            in width and 38½ yards to the piece, imported in bales, compressed, of
                            about 12 cubic feet to the bale.</p>
                        <p>Of the white shirtings Mr. ——— says they are loaded with terra alba and
                            starch to give appearance and weight, but being washed prove to be the
                            flimsiest material known to the trade. He suggests that the width of
                            cotton goods wanted by the Japanese for their use should be 30 and 36
                            inches only, and that if such goods <hi rend="italic">honestly</hi> made
                            were sent by our manufacturers to Japan, a growing market could be made
                            for them here at satisfactory prices. I have no doubt the same could be
                            done with cotton prints and cheap woolen goods of the width named. If
                            cotton yarns of the sizes and proportions used here and specified in the
                            inclosed memorandum “well bleached and softly twisted” were forwarded by
                            our merchants through competent agents, they would at the prices quoted
                            laid down here find a ready sale.</p>

                            <p>Through competition by the English manufacturers endeavoring to
                                obtain the market by low offerings, the quality has been reduced so
                                low that the Japanese do not take the quantity of these goods they
                                would if the quality had been kept up to a fair standard. The
                                Japanese prefer their own make, which is manufactured largely from
                                imported yarns.</p>

                                starch, showing an apparent finish and weight, but on washing they
                                became the flimsiest material known to the trade. No doubt if an
                                honest-made article, capable of doing some service, was sent here,
                                proper widths, 30 and 36 inches of our manufacture, a growing market
                                could be made at satisfactory prices.</p>
                            <p>Importation of the above in 1875, 46,637,309 yards, value $2,616,723;
                                1876, 56,387,194 yards, value $2,997,595.</p>

                            <p>It is with English prints the same as with white shirtings though not
                                to the same extent that terra alba and starch are used, and the new
                                appearance of the prints is deceptive. The sale is not as yet large
                                for these goods, but if a good quality of well assorted, patterns
                                was regularly sent, with the required widths and lengths of 30
                                inches wide, 24 yards to the piece, a growing market for our
                                manufactures could be obtained. Widths and lengths, as now put up by
                                American manufacturers will not answer, nor can they be made to
                                answer unless altered to the above-mentioned widths and lengths on
                                account of the entire difference in the mode of dress.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">cotton yarns.</hi></p>
                            <p>The sizes used by the Japanese are 16 and 24, 28 and 32, 38 and 42,
                                sold by the picul in bales of 3 piculs, or 400 pounds, in 10 pound
                                bundles, 40 bundles to the bale, compressed so as to measure about
                                11½ to 12 cubic feet.</p>
                            <p>The proportions wanted are: 60 per cent., 16 to24; 20 per cent., 28
                                to 32; 10 per cent., 38 to 42. Importations, 1875,137,253 piculs,
                                value $4,057,850; 1876, 147,099 piculs, value $4,151,514.</p>
                            <p>The quality of the yarns is only fair. India cotton is: used in the
                                manufacture, which reduces the standard, consequently can be sold
                                somewhat less than what the American yarns can be sold for.
                                Notwithstanding this commercial advantage in favor of the English,
                                American yarns, if made to suit this market, well bleached and
                                softly twisted, can be laid down here at prices quoted and can at
                                once find as ready a sale as the English, make.</p>

                            July 13, 1877, relating to methods for increasing the commerce of the
                            United States with Mexico, anticipating, as is directed by the circular,
                            the annual commercial report of this consulate-general, soon to be
                            consolidated from the reports of consuls, and otherwise made up and
                            forwarded, I beg to transmit copies of two communications received by
                            this consulate from two gentlemen, one now, and the other recently, in
                            Mexico, the representatives of two business-houses of New York City, in

                        <p>For the moment I confine myself to mentioning the additional measure of
                            the subvention by the Government of the United States of steam or sail
                            freight-vessels to carry merchandise from ports of the United States to
                            Mexican ports, at freights so reduced that goods from the United States
                            can more successfully compete with European goods.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In reply to your letter of yesterday,
                                in which you request I should give you a sketch of the classes of
                                general merchandise that the United States can exchange <pb
                                    facs="0852" n="118" xml:id="pg_118"/> with profit to both
                                republics, I have, in the annexed appendix, inclosed you a list, and
                                can, with some experience through the United States, the West India
                                Islands, and South America, assure you that there is a great field
                                for such a trade.</p>
                            <p>There are a few matters to which I would like to draw your attention,
                                viz:</p>
                            <p>The advisability of establishing a United States bank agency.</p>
                            <p>Admittance of samples free of duty, or the Mexican Government to
                                allow a drawback.</p>
                            <p>The readjustment of the tariff on a system of ad valorem.</p>
                            <p>The heavy freight from the port of Vera Cruz to the city of
                                Mexico.</p>
                            <p>The want of information of the tariff in the United States.</p>
                            <p>The necessity of having consular polices and the form of filling them
                                up. These should be available with full information at the Mexican
                                consul’s office in New York.</p>
                            <p>It is but a duty on my part, which I gratefully comply with, to
                                express to you my acknowledgments for the great interest you have
                                shown, and the many hours of your Very valuable time that you, sir,
                                have devoted as the pioneer of the great country you represent, in
                                aiding toward the development of a new outlet for the consumption of
                                American manufactures and produce.</p>
                            <p>As a stranger in Mexico, to which I am accredited from one of the
                                leading houses in New York, it is gratifying for me to say that I
                                have been very successful. The object of the firm I represent is to
                                open up a foreign export trade from the United States, and I find
                                that Mexico will be a very available market in this respect,
                                especially when mutual concessions are made between the two
                                countries on a liberal scale, and to be established on a reciprocal
                                basis.</p>
                            <p>It is with much pleasure that I thank you for the very valuable and
                                useful information, in connection with the products and trade of the
                                Mexican Republic, you have unhesitatingly always afforded me; also,
                                for your cordial hospitality so happily spent at your consulate.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir yours, very obediently,</p>
                            <closer><signed>GEORGE MASON.</signed></closer>

                            <p>The undersigned, representative of the house of ——, New York,
                                recently visited this city with a view of trying the experiment as
                                to the possibility of offering with success, to the Mexican
                                commerce, light hardware, fancy goods, and plated ware. The struggle
                                has been a serious one, for the reason that the houses so long
                                established, and continued by the younger members of the firms for
                                so many years, have, therefore, had permanent agents and
                                correspondents in Europe, from whom they have received their goods,
                                and through whom they have given their orders. I have, however, been
                                reasonably successful in persuading buyers here that we can furnish
                                goods of a superior quality, and at such prices as will make it for
                                their interest to purchase of American, manufacturers. I find that a
                                great obstacle met with has been the high duties collected by the
                                Government of Mexico on many articles of manufacture, and also the
                                fact that duties are charged on gross weight, that is, case and
                                packing. The “Free Zone” on the northern frontier is an obstacle to
                                the profitable introduction of goods on which duties must be
                                paid.</p>

                        <p>The goods which can be imported into Mexico from the United States with
                            advantage are principally prints, low classes of dry-goods, hardware,
                            house-furnishing goods, arms, and machinery.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of American houses who have visited this capital and
                            other parts of the country here during the past year have received
                            orders for goods to a considerable amount, and the demand will increase,
                            as said goods are giving satisfaction. One hardware house alone,
                            established in this city, will retail over $200,000 of American goods
                            during the current year.</p>
                        <p>The railway rates from Vera Cruz to the city of Mexico are as follows:
                            First-class freight, $76.05 per ton $ second-class freight, $65.18 per
                            ton 5 third-class freight, $54.32 per ton, in Mexican dollars. The
                            average freight may be calculated at second class, but a large portion
                            goes through as third class, especially on articles from the United
                            States. If a reduction could be obtained on these rates, as well as on
                            those of the over-sea steamers, as referred to hereafter in the present
                            report, trade would be largely increased.</p>
                        <p>It is the belief of this consulate-general that legislation on the part
                            of the Congress of the United States can increase the commerce between
                            the United States and Mexico by granting a subsidy to a line of steamers
                            carrying freight between the ports of New York and New Orleans and Vera
                            Cruz and Tampico. Such subsidy should be sufficiently great to enable
                            such line of steamers to reduce their rates of freight so much lower
                            than those collected by the lines running to the Mexican Gulf ports from
                            Liverpool and St. Nazaire, as to induce buyers in Mexico to seek their
                            purchases in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The present large importing houses of Mexico are such as have generally
                            existed for many years, the oldest partners retiring to Europe or
                            elsewhere, upon acquiring a competent fortune, and leaving their sons or
                            younger partners or clerks to follow in the same channel. These houses
                            have had, for years, their agents and correspondents in the various
                            manufacturing and business cities of Europe, from whom they have ordered
                            and order goods. It will be difficult to induce such Mexican <pb
                                facs="0854" n="120" xml:id="pg_120"/> buyers to escape from this
                            routine, unless low freights as well as reduced prices call loudly for
                            their attention. But it is believed that much can be accomplished by the
                            legislation above referred to. The time now occupied in ordering goods
                            for Mexico, for delivery at Vera Cruz and Tampico, and receiving the
                            same is usually from three to four months, while by ordering and
                            duplicating orders through the telegraph via Matamoras and New Orleans,
                            from fifteen to twenty days will be sufficient for the receipt of goods
                            at Vera Cruz, resulting in diminution of exchange on funds, interest on
                            money employed, &amp;c. Should buyers prefer to pay for their goods by
                            shipments to the United States, such shipments will naturally be
                            increased, as well as the duties arising to the United States Treasury;
                            for such increased exports and imports must be many times greater than
                            the sum necessary to subsidize a line of steamers, so that their rates
                            of freight can be reduced to a schedule from 25 to 40 per cent. less
                            than that of the European lines running to Mexico. The present rate of
                            freights to Vera Cruz from the European ports, is as I am informed from
                            $7.35 to $36.37 per ton, while the rates by the lines of F. Alexandre
                            &amp; Sons, as I am informed, are $14.10 to $23.50 per ton from New York
                            to Vera Cruz and $10.50 to $16.36 from New Orleans to Vera Cruz.</p>
                        <p>I add hereto a communication received by me, on this subject, from Mr.
                            John Alexandre, of the firm of F. Alexandre &amp; Sons, of New York, who
                            happens to be in this city, from which you will observe that it is his
                            opinion that his line can reduce even their present rates of freight
                            from 25 to 50 per cent. by receiving a subsidy from the government of
                            the United States of $125,000 per annum for the New York and Vera Cruz
                            line, and $75,000 per annum for the New Orleans and Vera Cruz line:

                                    respecting the difference between the present rates of freight
                                    charges by the different English and French lines of steamers
                                    from Europe to Vera Cruz, and those charged by our line
                                    (Alexandre line) from New York to Vera Cruz and from New Orleans
                                    to Vera Cruz, running every three weeks, I beg to state that
                                    although I am away from the headquarters of our lines (New
                                    York), still I think that I can answer your inquiry sufficiently
                                    for the present.</p>
                                <p>As per within copies of bills of lading for goods arrived this
                                    year at Vera Cruz, ex Royal Mail Packet Company from
                                    Southampton, ex French Transatlantic Company from France, ex
                                    West India and Pacific Steamship Line from Liverpool ex
                                    Liverpool Line from Liverpool, you will see that these lines
                                    charged from 30 shillings and 10 per cent. primage to 135
                                    shillings and 10 per cent. primage per ton of 40 cubic feet, or
                                    2,240 pounds, at option of steamer, which, in our money, is
                                    $7.35 to $36.37 gold per ton; while the rates charged by our
                                    line at present are: from New York, 35 cents per cubic foot, or
                                    1 cent per pound and 5 per cent. primage; from New Orleans, 25
                                    cents per cubic foot, or ¾ cent per pound, and 5 per cent.
                                    primage; which is equal to $11.70 to $23.50 per ton from New
                                    York, and $10.50 to $16.36 per ton from New Orleans.</p>
                                <p>In answer to your inquiry, whether, in my opinion, “the trade in
                                    export of manufactured and other goods from the United States to
                                    Mexico would increase if the American Government would grant aid
                                    (subsidy) to our line of steamers, so as to ran the steamers
                                    oftener, and particularly to allow us to lower our rates of
                                    freight, so low that American manufacturers could compete with
                                    Europe in furnishing a large percentage of what now comes all
                                    from Europe;” to this inquiry I can easily answer it, and I
                                    think you or anyone else will understand that if our government
                                    gave us a subsidy of about $125,000 per annum for the New York
                                    line and $75,000 per annum for the New Orleans line, which sums
                                    are not one-half of what the French and English lines receive we
                                    could reduce our rates of freight, say 25 per cent. to 33 per
                                    cent., and even 50 per cent. (the latter on cheap goods), which
                                    would enable American merchants and manufacturers to compete
                                    successfully for the Mexican trade, or, at least a large portion
                                    of it, besides offering more frequent communication, resulting,
                                    that, before long the United States would have a very large
                                    demand for its manufactures.</p>
                                <p>From the last report of the French line it is stated that they
                                    received from their government, as subsidy, the sum of 2,208,864
                                    francs, equal to $441,773, gold, per annum. <pb facs="0855"
                                        n="121" xml:id="pg_121"/> The exact sum received by the
                                    English lines I am not prepared to give, but I feel confident it
                                    is also a very considerable sum.</p>
                                <p>With the aid our lines receive since 1867 from the Mexican
                                    Government, you are aware of the increased benefits to both the
                                    United States and Mexico, so if we received greater aid, you can
                                    easily understand that we would be in a fine position to take
                                    away from Europe a large percentage of a trade now almost wholly
                                    monopolized by England and France.</p>
                                <p>Very respectfully,</p>

                            the Department in the circular of July 13, 1877, I would state that, in
                            my opinion, with efforts made with patience and prudence in the right
                            direction, the United States might soon be enabled to compete
                            successfully with Europe (Manchester) in the production of cotton,
                            linen, and woolen manufactures suitable for the west coast of Mexico,
                            the more so as of late interest on capital and wages of operatives in
                            the United States have been reduced very nearly to the rates of
                            England.</p>
                        <p>One of the greatest difficulties in the way of American merchants is
                            without any doubt the long-established relations between the
                            commission-houses in Europe and the importers on this coast. In many
                            cases the establishment here is only a branch of the house in Europe.
                            The result of these close relations naturally is that a great many
                            articles which might be imported advantageously from the United States
                            are brought from Europe, and nearly all the exports find their way to
                            European markets.</p>
                        <p>Rates of interest charged in accounts between European houses and the
                            merchants of this coast are regulated by the rate of the Bank of
                            England.</p>
                        <p>I also must state here that the merchants on this coast complain of high
                            commissions in New York, and of high rates of freight from and to New
                            York. For instance, whilst freight from New York out is $60 per ton, it
                            is but £7 from England.</p>
                        <p>Brown domestics are manufacture plentifully for home consumption in the
                            country from cotton cultivated on this coast, and the high protective
                            import duty of 9 cents per square meter renders the importation of the
                            foreign article impossible.</p>
                        <p>It may safely be asserted that the business done annually between
                            Manchester and the ports of the west coast of Mexico amounts to
                            $4,000,000.</p>
                        <p>Among the staple cotton goods brought to this coast from Manchester fancy
                            prints occupy the first place, being of more consumption than any other
                            article, and deserve to be described as minutely as possible, as well as
                            the manner how they are made up and packed.</p>
                        <p>The importer selects from patterns furnished to him from Europe such as
                            may suit the particular taste of the inhabitants of a certain district,
                                <pb facs="0856" n="122" xml:id="pg_122"/> having obtained from the
                            Manchester printer the privilege of having printed the minimum of ten
                            pieces of each pattern; thus, if needed, he can obtain small lots of ten
                            bales, of fifty pieces of assorted patterns each, and suit all his
                            customers. The printing cloth used for these prints is 14 by 15 threads
                            in one-fourth of one inch square, 28 to 29 inches wide when printed,
                            well “swissed” (starched and mangled), as this operation is called at
                            Manchester, made up in pieces of 24 yards; the colors are fast;
                            cost-price of piece at Manchester 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi
                                rend="italic">d</hi>. to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi
                                rend="italic">d</hi>., approximately, according to price of printing
                            of pattern, exclusive of commissions, expenses of packing, etc., etc.;
                            import duties on prints per square meter, say 14 cents; sell per piece
                            at $5.25 to $5.50. As these goods have to be transported on mules to the
                            interior of the country, exposed on the road to all sorts of accidents,
                            they must be packed very carefully, viz: Each bale of fifty pieces has
                            inner wrapper of brown or bleached cotton of 9 yards, inner paper, inner
                            wrapper of Hessians (hemp packing cloth), tarpaulin, and at last outer
                            cover of Hessians. Such a bale is then compressed and bound with iron
                            hoops, weighs from 180 to 190 pounds, and is better suited for
                            transportation over rough roads than a case.</p>
                        <p>I have had the opportunity of examining patterns of American prints sent
                            to a house at Acapulco by a large New York house, said to be of ready
                            sale in the West Indies, Central, and South America. Although they are
                            of a superior quality (15 by 16 threads for one-fourth of one inch
                            square), they are not so well “swissed” or finished as the Manchester
                            article, and for this reason, as well as on account of their
                            unaccustomed width of 25 inches, would not sell readily on this
                            coast.</p>
                        <p>A better quality of prints is imported under the name of French imitation
                            prints (percales); that is to say, select French patterns with French
                            finish, made up in pieces of 44 meters. Printing cloth used for these
                            prints is 15 by 15, or 15 by 16 threads in one-fourth of one inch square
                            (like the American prints mentioned), 29 inches wide, cost at Manchester
                            of piece of 44ards, 18 francs. In every case each bale of prints is
                            accompanied by its corresponding sample-book.</p>
                        <p>Bleached cotton sheeting and shirting in several qualities and widths are
                            the articles which rank second amongst the imports on the west coast of
                            Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Import duties on the same are 9 cents per square meter. The article is
                            generally made up in pieces of 40 yards. Special attention is paid to a
                            very good and compact finish. The most salable and cheapest quality is
                            of twenty-three threads in five millimeters square, with a width of
                            28–29 inches, costing, at Manchester, per piece of 40yards, about 7
                            francs. This quality, 23 threads, 24 inches wide, sells, per Mexican
                            vara, at 11 cents; 27–28inches wide, sells, per Mexican vara, at 13
                            cents; 29–30 inches wide, sells, per Mexican vara, at 14 cents; 32
                            inches wide, sells, per Mexican vara, at 15 cents; 35–36 inches wide,
                            sells, per Mexican vara, at 16 cents, Better qualities, up to thirty
                            threads in five millimeters square, with calico or linen finish, are
                            also in demand and imported largely. Ordinary qualities are brought
                            long-fold, the better qualities sometimes book-fold.</p>
                        <p>Among other articles in demand are printed jaconets, white ground. The
                            quality generally bought for this market is known at Manchester as 12<hi

                            The import duties on the same are 16 cents per meter square. They sell
                            at $5 to $5.25; they are packed in bales like prints.</p>
                        <p>Printed jaconet handkerchiefs are likewise of much consumption. <pb
                                facs="0857" n="123" xml:id="pg_123"/> In quality, as per sample
                            herewith, 28 inches by 25 inches, they cost, at Manchester, according to
                            colors, from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to
                                2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and are made up in trusses of 300
                            dozen—import duties thereon, $1.06 per dozen—sell generally at $1.62 to
                            $1.75 per dozen.</p>
                        <p>Together with these principal staple articles, a great variety of cotton
                            fabrics of minor importance, required for an assortment suitable for the
                            trade, are imported; but only in small quantities compared with the
                            consumption of prints and bleached goods.</p>
                        <p>Linen goods occupy but a secondary position in the trade of this coast.
                            Import duties on the same are 16 cents per square meter up to thirty
                            threads in five millimeters square, and 22 cents per square meter for
                            all above thirty. Some of the most current are the following:</p>
                        <p>Platillas and Silesias: from 27 to 34 threads in five millimetres square,
                            26 inches to 28 inches, and 35 inches to 36 inches wide, in pieces of
                            17½ and 35 yards. Silesias of 27 threads, as above stated, with a width
                            of 35 inches, cost at Manchester about 8¾<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per
                            yard.</p>
                        <p>Creas, quality 21 to 29 threads in five millimetres square, from 26 to 29
                            inches wide; in pieces of 32 or 64 yards, cost price at Manchester of
                            crea, 21 threads, 28–29 inches wide, 6½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per
                            yard.</p>
                        <p>Bretañas, quality 33 to 40 threads in five millimetres square, 35 to 36
                            inches in width, made up in small fancy pieces of 7 yards, book-fold;
                            cost price at Manchester of quality of 33 threads, 35 to 36 inches wide,
                                11½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard.</p>
                        <p>These articles are supposed to be of pure linen.</p>
                        <p>For woolen manufactures there is but little demand. Blankets of all
                            kinds, as well as the ordinary qualities of cassimere and broadcloth,
                            are made in this country with high protective import duties. A little of
                            several fabrics of woolen and cotton, or pure woolen for ladies’ dresses
                            mostly, like merino, and alpaca, &amp;c., is imported, and likewise a
                            small quantity of the better qualities of light cassimere and
                            broadcloth. All these goods are sold to customers with 6, 8, and even 10
                            months’ credit, or 1 per cent. discount per month if paid for before
                            due.</p>
                        <p>It is to be hoped that the Mexican Government may soon abolish the
                            ruinous export duty of 5 per cent. on silver coin, which is the only
                            thing received in payment.</p>
                        <p>As far as other articles of American manufacture, like flour, lumber,
                            California produce, machinery, arms and ammunitions, candles,
                            ship-chandlery, drugs; iron, hard, glass and earthen ware; furniture,
                            edged-tools, coal-oil, groceries, stationery, wines, liquors, &amp;c.,
                            &amp;c., are concerned, I would only remark that the commercial
                            relations between San Francisco and the west coast are growing more
                            important every year.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In conformity with the instructions of
                            your dispatch, dated the 13th of July, relating to the best method of
                            promoting commercial relations between the United States and Mexico, I
                            beg leave to submit the following report:</p>
                        <p>Very little of the commerce of Mexico is done with the United States, for
                            want of American merchants in the country to promote it; for, owing to
                            the general insecurity of property, and the trouble met with in the <pb
                                facs="0858" n="124" xml:id="pg_124"/> custom-houses, ignorance of
                            the language, &amp;c., our countrymen prefer other localities. But by
                            placing this country in a state of security, there can be no reason why
                            American manufactures cannot be imported and compete favorably with
                            those of any other nation.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>In order to increase commercial relations with this country the first
                            requisite is <hi rend="italic">peace</hi> in the country.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>It is believed that a treaty of alliance, guaranteeing the integrity of
                            Mexican territory and its independence, with the right of one nation to
                            assist the other against internal and external enemies, would be popular
                            in this country and not objectionable to the United States. By such a
                            treaty, the moral influence of it would be such that no troops would be
                            necessary to be introduced to maintain peace, for it would be seen by
                            revolutionists that although they might overthrow the government under
                            ordinary circumstances, they could not do so if it were backed by the
                            United States; and instead of getting into power through revolution,
                            would do so through the ballot-box, and thus inaugurate; a favorable
                            political revolution in the country.</p>
                        <p>Peace thus secured, there would be an opening for railroads built by
                            American capitalists; and where there are railroads, American merchants,
                            mechanics, farmers, and miners will follow, and carry with them American
                            commerce, and there will be an end to the European monopoly.</p>
                        <p>A railroad extended from the Paso del Norte through the table-lands of
                            this republic, via Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas, to Lagos, and from
                            Lagos to Mexico, via Leon, Guanajuato, and Queretaro, to Mexico; another
                            connecting at Lagos, via Aguas Calientes, San Luis Potosi, and
                            Tamaulipas, to the Rio Grande, near Brownsville; branches connecting at
                            Lagos, via Guadalajara, Sayula, Zapotlan, and Colima, to Manzaniilo, and
                            another connecting with the main line in Chihuahua, and passing through
                            Sonora to Guaymas, would open up the whole country to American
                            commerce.</p>
                        <p>Manzaniilo being the only safe harbor for vessels between Guaymas and
                            Acapulco, and there being an easy grade from the port through the
                            coast-range to the table lands, offers special advantages over all other
                            ports for the main Pacific branch.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your “separate” communication of August
                            7th ultimo invites my attention to the question how the United States
                            may best enlarge their trade with the Netherlands, and refers me to a
                            rule which directs reports to be sent “upon such miscellaneous subjects
                            as may be of importance,” specifying among others “price of labor and
                            food.”</p>
                        <pb facs="0859" n="125" xml:id="pg_125"/>
                        <p>The first essential in aid of interchange of commodities is the
                            possession of adequate shipping, fitted out, supplied and manned at a
                            rate of expenditure that will enable the United States to compete
                            successfully with the merchant marine of the Netherlands. The United
                            States have an advantage over nearly all the nations of Europe by being
                            in possession of virgin forests that furnish all the timber necessary
                            for ship-building. But the Dutch trader can send his vessels to the
                            United States, import the timber, and with it build a vessel at less
                            cost than he could build or buy it in the United States. This is owing
                            to the much lower wages which he pays for labor here. Also, when he
                            proceeds to equip, supply, and man the vessel, he does it in this
                            country at a very much lower rate. He will, for example, engage a crew
                            of able-bodied seamen for from $10 to $12 per month each, at a rate
                            lessened by half, at least, from that which he would be obliged to pay
                            in the ports of the United States.</p>
                        <p>It is only stating what is self-evident to all commercial dealers, that,
                            for the encouragement of interchange of commodities vessels must have
                            remunerative freights upon outward as well as return trips. The
                            statistics of the last year show that vessels coming from the United
                            States to this country brought cargoes, but that one-third of the number
                            returned in ballast. Within a few years the article of petroleum has
                            come into universal use in Holland. It is all imported from the United
                            States, but the vessels that bring it, for the most part, return
                            freighted only with empty casks. There is also here continuous and
                            reliable demand for cotton, grain, meat, lard, bacon, tobacco, and
                            resin. The importation of these articles would be much larger if the
                            vessels that bring them could carry back profitably coffee, madder, tin,
                            glassware, gin, wine, linen goods, and other manufactured articles.
                            Holland being so centrally situated, has choice of the markets of the
                            world. As a matter of course, she will take her wares where the cost of
                            introducing them will be the least; and she will select what she needs
                            for home consumption from the countries that can furnish them at the
                            cheapest rate. Her ships, equipped and manned at the reduced rate
                            referred to, will successfully compete with the vessels of any nation
                            having a higher rate.</p>
                        <p>In the present antagonism between capital and labor in the United;
                            States, I cannot aid your inquiries better than by giving facts in
                            regard to the price of labor and the condition of laborers in
                            Holland.</p>
                        <p>In this country, upon an area of somewhat more than 20,000 English square
                            miles, there live four millions of people. There perhaps cannot be found
                            elsewhere an equal number occupying a similar area in which a larger
                            amount of wealth has been accumulated in individual ownership, and in
                            which the operatives or producers are more contented, and in possession
                            of more of the ordinary needs of life, and less embarrassed by debt.</p>
                        <p>The average compensation of laborers in Holland does not exceed one-third
                            of the average compensation of the same class in the United States. (I
                            may note here that when I speak of prices, it will be more convenient to
                            the reader to use the terms of the United States currency, the Holland
                            florin, or its 100 cents, being of the same value as 40 cents United
                            States.) The ordinary workman in this country receives from 40 to 60
                            cents per day, according to the number of hours in which he may have
                            worked. It will not be amiss to remark that the difficulty which has
                            often threatened to be serious in the United States has been
                            satisfactorily solved here by paying the workman by the hour, and giving
                            him the privilege to work as many hours as he pleases. The result is,
                            that the time of work, instead of being less than ten hours, is almost
                            invariably <pb facs="0860" n="126" xml:id="pg_126"/> in excess. Some
                            continue at work ten, some eleven, some twelve, and others even thirteen
                            or fourteen hours. During the summer months there are eighteen hours of
                            daylight in this latitude. They can commence, the working day at live or
                            six o’clock in the morning, rest for breakfast between seven and eight,
                            rest for second meal between twelve and one and a half, and the third
                            time between four and five, quitting at any time before dark, which does
                            not set in at that season until nine or nine and a half o’clock. That I
                            may speak reliably, I have before me the time-book of the superintendent
                            of the workmen of a large brick building being constructed for one of
                            the government departments. The highest rate to the brick-layers is 7.20
                            cents per hour; others received from 5.20 cents to 6 cents per hour. So
                            that for a day of ten hours, the best received 72 cents, the inferior 52
                            cents, and at the same rate for additional hours, many of them making 14
                            hours per day. Men employed in sweeping the streets of the city receive
                            40 cents per day. Farm hands in the country receive less. Nor is this
                            low rate of compensation confined to those called laborers. It pervades
                            all callings. The policemen of the city are paid from $2.80 to $4 per
                            week; letter-carriers are paid at the same rate; well trained men
                            servants who speak more than one language offer their services for from
                            $8 to $10 per month; female cooks for from $3 to $4 per month;
                            house-maids for from $2.50 to $3.50 for the same time. An experienced
                            coachman hires for $15 per month, and supports himself, wife, and child
                            upon this sum.</p>
                        <p>Efficient merchant-clerks receive $300to$600 per annum; schoolteachers in
                            academies receive from $400 to $500, and the rector or principal of the
                            chief high school in the city receives $1,100 per annum. The annual
                            allowance for members of Parliament is $800, and for ministers of state
                            or cabinet officers $5,000 per annum. Barristers are regarded as at the
                            top of the profession when their receipts reach $8,000.</p>
                        <p>Sitting one day at dinner with a very intelligent and prominent officer
                            of the government, I inquired of him how it was possible for employés to
                            live upon such meager wages. “Possible!” said he; “they live very well;
                            and experience has shown that the laborers have more laved, as a general
                            rule, at the end of the year at the present rate than when the
                            compensation was higher.”</p>
                        <p>After many inquiries and some consideration given to the subject, I infer
                            that the laboring population maintain themselves by the low rates of
                            compensation for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. They are accustomed to a careful economy. If their wages are only $3
                            per week, they will live within that amount by denying themselves
                            indulgence in the more costly articles. For purposes of revenue the
                            government treats meat and sugar as luxuries, and a tax is assessed upon
                            so much of these articles as may be consumed within the country. They
                            are therefore very sparingly used by workingmen. Meat is of higher price
                            here than in the United States, and this price is kept up by the demand
                            in the London market, where all that Holland can spare finds ready sale.
                            On account of cheap labor, vegetables and other products of the farm
                            sell very low. The cheaper grains are used for bread. The laboring man
                            obtains his rent at a reasonable rate. As he lives chiefly in towns and
                            cities, he takes an apartment or so much space as he actually needs for
                            his family. Rents are low, because the taxes upon real estate are very
                            moderate. In his dress he adopts the style and material that has been in
                            use for many years. This can be made up at home, without resort to the
                            shops. If he is employed on damp ground, he uses the wooden instead of
                            leather shoes. Many articles he uses are as much lower in price than the
                            same articles in the United States as the <pb facs="0861" n="127"
                                xml:id="pg_127"/> rate of his wages is lower than those given there.
                            This difference in price may be illustrated by an example. Holland and
                            the United States each import the stock or body of the silk hat from the
                            same country. When you go into a store here to buy the article, after
                            it, has passed through the hands of the operatives, you will be charged
                            only $2.80 for the best quality, but you may pay for a similar article
                            in the cities of the United States the sum of $8; and a like disparity
                            will be found in the price of linen goods and other articles of ordinary
                            wearing apparel.</p>
                        <p>2. Their economy is promoted by the careful preparation and prompt
                            execution of the laws; of their country.</p>
                        <p>All the laws are prepared and proposed by the ministers of state, having
                            each in his department the responsibility of the conduct of the
                            government. They propose nothing for which they do not anticipate the
                            approval of a majority of both branches of the legislative assembly.
                            When a bill is introduced, it is subject to all the amendments that may
                            occur to any of the members. If, after being thus thoroughly considered,
                            it passes into law, it is duly respected by all concerned, and its
                            provisions are thoroughly and efficiently executed. The consequence of
                            this care is that but few laws are passed, and those already passed are
                            not frequently altered by amendments. All subordinates who have any
                            share in their administration are faithful in their application. The
                            result is that litigation is diminished in a remarkable degree.</p>
                        <p>Judges and magistrates are selected discreetly and from men of solid
                            character and ripe experience. Certainty in the execution of the law is
                            so invariable, that very few of the minor differences among men find
                            their way into the courts. Disagreements between employers and employés
                            have ready solution without the aid of attorneys or magistrates. The
                            costs and fees of frivolous actions are in this way saved. In the city
                            of the Hague, having a population of 100,000, there are only about a
                            dozen lawyers who subsist upon practice at the bar.</p>
                        <p>3. The laboring population do not incur the expense of time and money
                            connected with the excitement of political strife. Political elections
                            here proceed as quietly as any other matter of business. Candidates for
                            office are selected from men so well known to electors that scarcely any
                            one deems it necessary to give them any more information than they
                            already have. Processions, mass-meetings, and addresses to crowds are
                            not in fashion. The government, in regulating the extent of suffrage,
                            has regard to the protection of property by making the right dependent
                            upon a property qualification. Every citizen in the Hague who pays taxes
                            equal to $20 can vote $ and every citizen in Amsterdam who pays taxes
                            equal to $50 votes. So that the limitation is affected by the size of
                            the city in which the voter exercises the privilege of suffrage. In the
                            country it is as low as $8. By long usage a candidate here has nothing
                            to do with urging his own claims for office. A member of Parliament may
                            be elected from any one of the districts of the realm, but he never
                            appears in the district with the view of canvassing. To do so would only
                            jeopardize his prospects of success.</p>
                        <p>As the non-voter is not occupied with the effort to gain office for
                            himself or in hearing the harangues of others who would secure it, he
                            devotes the time and money thus saved to the making of his tenement more
                            comfortable. He cultivates and ornaments the patch of ground he may have
                            about it. There is scarcely a house in Holland whose windows or
                            surroundings are not decorated with flowers.</p>
                        <p>As offices are not used for partisan purposes, those who may be in office
                            do not lose time in the apprehension of being suddenly ejected. The
                            clerk of the first house of Parliament resigned a few days since, <pb
                                facs="0862" n="128" xml:id="pg_128"/> having served that body in the
                            same capacity for thirty-five years. His deputy, who had been with him
                            for twenty-five years, was made his successor. The register of deeds for
                            this district has been in that office for forty years. One of the public
                            printers has been in the service of the government for sixty-six years.
                            Of the city board, or common council, of the Hague, seven members have
                            been in office since 1851, having been re-elected at each successive
                            election during that period. A public dinner was recently given to them
                            in commemoration of their quarter-century service. In a town near by the
                            postmaster holds the office that has been held by members of the same
                            family for over one hundred and fifty years, his father, grandfather,
                            and great-grandfather having been his predecessors. The present
                            incumbent has had uninterrupted possession during the last twenty-five
                            years. These instances show either that there is no great pressure on
                            the part of outsiders, or that the appointing power is not moved by the
                            clamor of applicants so long as the incumbent is competent and
                            faithful.</p>
                        <p>4. There is economy in the steadiness of habit and pursuit. The business
                            in which a young man has been trained is generally his business for
                            life. He does not readily change from one pursuit to another. He is
                            content with moderate gains without risk. Failure in business is a
                            lasting stigma; so much so, that it descends from father to son and to
                            grandson. The man who should fail in this country cannot well set up
                            again. His business career is ended.</p>
                        <p>Instances are numerous in which employés have remained with their
                            employers for twenty-five or thirty years and even longer. A large
                            portion of the population, though constantly coming in contact with
                            people from all parts of the world, retain the same habits, customs, and
                            style of dress which their ancestors for many generations had. This
                            saves the expense arising from change of fashion and change of
                            material.</p>
                        <p>It is owing to this steadiness of pursuit and carefulness in regard to
                            business obligations that what are called <hi rend="italic">crises</hi>,
                            or revulsions, in the commercial world do not occur in Holland. There
                            are periods when business is said to be less active or profitable than
                            at other times, sympathizing in this respect with the countries with
                            which she has trade. Banks are conducted frugally, with no attempt at
                            display or show, and consider that they are doing well if they realize
                            from 3 to 4 per cent. per annum. One of the best informed gentlemen of
                            Holland tells me that during the past forty-four years there has not
                            been an instance of a failure among the banks of the country. A
                            defaulting officer would not be tolerated. The currency has for a great
                            while been perfectly sound, the paper of the banks during the past sixty
                            years being at all times equal in value to gold.</p>
                        <p>A large portion of the government debt, contracted years ago by the war
                            with Belgium and other such extraordinary occurrences, bears only 2½ per
                            cent. interest. The government could at any time raise from its own
                            citizens all the money it could need at from 3 to 4 per cent.
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>5. There is economy to all the people in the fact that the state is
                            moderate and discriminating in its method of assessing taxes. It seeks
                            to draw its revenues chiefly from the productive property, making its
                            assessments light upon what is yielding no income. For example, although
                            the tax upon an unproductive city lot maybe small, yet if the owner
                            gives notice that he is ready to put buildings upon it the lot will be
                            exempted from taxation for seven years. And when the building is
                            completed, if at any time it is unoccupied or tenantless, on application
                            of the owner there will be an abatement of the tax. Taxes are rated upon
                            houses by the number of doors, windows, and chimneys, for by <pb
                                facs="0863" n="129" xml:id="pg_129"/> this method the more costly
                            dwellings, owned by the wealthy, pay proportion ably a higher tax.</p>
                        <p>While the government thus gathers its revenues by moderate assessments,
                            it is in return prompt in extending protection to person and property.
                            An efficient police is maintained, not only in the cities but throughout
                            the country. A trespasser upon land will be at once arrested and made to
                            suffer the penalty. The division line of the owner is as inviolable as
                            the walls of his mansion. The largest possible freedom is allowed to
                            every one so long as he is well disposed, but so soon as a violation of
                            the law is threatened the most summary treatment is dealt out. Not long
                            since there were indications of a formidable riot in Amsterdam, caused
                            by the suppression of a noisy holiday. The government at the capital,
                            upon the requisition of the burgomaster of that city, dispatched a
                            military force that at once quelled the disturbance.</p>
                        <p>6. There is economy in the mode of building that saves property from
                            destruction by fire. Since my residence here I have not heard a fire
                            alarm, nor have I seen the gathering of an engine company. The only fire
                            that I can obtain any account of during the past fifteen months, was the
                            burning of the inside of a small confectionery shop, caused by the
                            breaking of a gas-pipe. The buildings are constructed of brick or stone,
                            and the roof covered with tile that cannot burn. I have not seen a
                            wooden dwelling in Holland. Incendiarism is unknown. If it should occur,
                            efforts would not cease till the perpetrator should be discovered and so
                            severely punished as to discourage the crime.</p>
                        <p>In corroboration of the above statement it may be mentioned that the cost
                            of insurance against loss by fire is almost nominal. It does not average
                            more than the half of 1 per cent. And even at this rate insurance
                            companies are very profitable, realizing from 12 to 16 per cent.</p>
                        <p>On two occasions since I have been here the soot in one of the chimneys
                            of my residence took fire and made more than the usual smoke issue from
                            the top; but before any of my household were aware that anything unusual
                            was happening, the police were ringing hurriedly at the door, with
                            fire-extinguishers in their hands.</p>
                        <p>Having thus referred to some of the causes which appear to be aids in
                            enabling this people to prosper with a scale of low compensations, I may
                            add generally that no compression is used on the part of the government
                            to promote this condition of moderation. Each individual appears to
                            possess the largest possible personal liberty. The people are more than
                            usually good-humored, kind, and courteous. There is a very noticeable
                            absence of the rougher element that is conspicuous in some countries.
                            Strikes and trades unions seem to have no existence. The government
                            assumes scarcely any responsibility in the direction of sumptuary laws.
                            It does not direct what the subject shall eat or drink. It has adopted
                            no license-law regulating the use or sale of intoxicating liquors. Any
                            citizen may engage in the business of vending liquors, wholesale or
                            retail, without prohibition. The business is taxed like other forms of
                            business. Nor does it take charge of the domestic relations, in so far
                            that it makes no provisions for actions at law for breach of promise to
                            marry. It furnishes no redress by what are called actions of <hi
                                rend="italic">crim con</hi>. So far as the state is concerned,
                            marriage is treated as a civil contract, and divorce is granted on proof
                            of violations of its terms.</p>
                        <p>While the government is thus liberal in regard to the personal rights of
                            its subjects, it is very successful in the management of its internal or
                            fiscal affairs. It projects and carries on public works with a success
                            not <pb facs="0864" n="130" xml:id="pg_130"/> surpassed by individual
                            enterprise. “It has ordered and controlled the building of a sufficient
                            number of lines of railroads to accommodate the business of the country.
                            It operates these by the agency of companies, who are joint
                            stockholders; and although it has fixed the tariff of travel at a rate
                            not exceeding one cent per mile for third-class passengers, which forms
                            75 per cent. of the whole amount of travel, yet it has not suffered a
                            deficiency, and on the trunk-routes distributes satisfactory dividends.”
                            Pilfering by officials rarely, if ever, occurs. It grants no free
                            passes, and when an officer of the road wishes to give his friends a
                            ride or an excursion he pays for the tickets as he would if he had no
                            connection with the road. The greatest possible care is taken to avoid
                            accidents. At every road-crossing a guard attends upon the passing of
                            every train. A telegraph-bell notifies the guard from the last station
                            of the approach of each train. He then closes the gate, and renders it
                            impossible for ordinary vehicles to cross the track when the train is
                            passing.</p>
                        <p>The government, through its post-office department, delivers by carriers,
                            for two cents each, letters to every house in the kingdom—not only in
                            the cities, but in the entire country. The report of the receipts and
                            expenditures of this department, laid before me by the
                            postmaster-general of Holland, embracing the time between the years 1849
                            and 1877, shows that for each year the receipts have been largely in
                            excess of the expenditures. Take, for example, the year 1876. The
                            receipts were $1,308,035.78, the expenditures were $865,690.19, giving
                            to the state a profit of $442,345.59. The excess on the side of profit
                            has been about in the same proportion during the past twenty-five
                            years.</p>
                        <p>The government provides throughout the realm the best of wagon-roads.
                            They are paved with stone or a very hard clinker brick. They are kept in
                            perfect repair by a force that is constantly traversing them for that
                            purpose. As the heavy freight is more cheaply carried by canal, the
                            roads are better preserved. The streets of the city in which this is
                            written are swept within every twenty-four hours, and the sweepings are
                            sold for nearly enough to pay the expense. They are used for fertilizing
                            the farming-land.</p>
                        <p>The government maintains an army of 60,000 men, besides 23,000 in one of
                            the colonies. The soldiers are well clothed and fed while under
                            training, but receive but nominal pay.</p>
                        <p>The state relies upon religious societies for the care of the poor within
                            their districts. It has no general system of houses or farms for
                            paupers.</p>
                        <p>As to education, the obligation the government assumes is to require
                            municipalities to provide abundant schools for all youth between the
                            ages of six and twelve years. The option remains with the municipality
                            whether to make tuition free or to charge a moderate rate.</p>
                        <p>After this cursory statement of the price of labor and what the
                            government is enabled to do for the people on an economical basis, it is
                            not for me to discuss further the causes of this stable condition of
                            affairs. Suffice it to say that, within the range of my observation, the
                            inhabitants, as a whole, of no country appear more prosperous, more
                            comfortable, or more contented.</p>
                        <p>The prices of nearly all commodities are placed upon their merits,
                            without artificial props, and the markets of all the world are
                            accessible for the introduction of whatever may be cheapest and most
                            needed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have given jour dispatch of the 7th of
                            August, marked “Separate,” my careful attention; and, as bearing upon
                            the subject of the commerce between Portugal and the United States, of
                            the development of which that dispatch treats, I forward herewith two
                            copies of the reports of the consuls of Portugal concerning commerce in
                            general for 1875, just published by the government, and a copy of the
                            “General statistics of the commerce of Portugal with its colonies and
                            with foreign countries during the civil year 1874.”</p>
                        <p>I think the trade between the United States and Portugal could be
                            increased. Wheat, tobacco, petroleum, hemp, lumber, and staves, imported
                            from the United States, now sell to our advantage, and these imports are
                            on the increase. I am also of opinion that there is a profitable market
                            in Portugal for cheap American cotton printing-cloths, in 1870, cloths,
                            bleached and unbleached, for printing, to the value of £624,660 and
                            £131,330 of prints were imported from Great Britain; and this trade is
                            said to be on the increase. These cloths are printed here, with designs
                            to suit the national taste, and are worn in Portugal and her colonial
                            possessions, to which they are exported in considerable quantities. I am
                            informed that there is an attempt being made to establish a manufactory
                            of such cloths near Lisbon, as it is believed that they can be produced
                            so as to compete with those imported. I cannot give prices, but it is
                            safe to say that if Great Britain can send cotton printing-cloths here
                            at a profit, we can do the same.</p>
                        <p>The following tables show the importation of British manufactured goods
                            into Portugal in the years 1870 and 1874, that for 1874 being the last
                            which has been published. It will be seen by these that there was a
                            decrease in the value of the importations in 1874, but that may be owing
                            to some fluctuations in trade.</p>

                        <p>I am likewise of opinion that the demand can be created here for American
                            agricultural implements and labor-saving machinery, although <pb
                                facs="0866" n="132" xml:id="pg_132"/> the introduction of such
                            articles may be attended with opposition at first, on account of the
                            prejudices of the people.</p>
                        <p>American sewing-machines are largely sold, and English agricultural
                            implements, such as steam-plows and reaping-machines, are being
                            successfully introduced, though not on a large scale. American
                            mill-machinery for grinding grain might find a limited market. But I
                            will report more in detail in a future communication on this
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>At the moment I am not prepared to specify Portuguese products and
                            manufactures the exportation of which to the United States might be
                            increased, but I am safe in naming port and Bucellas wines, oranges, and
                            lemons; and also the native jewelry of the country, which is remarkably
                            fine, some of it being of exquisite workmanship and design.</p>
                        <p>As pertinent to the subject, I beg to add the following facts in regard
                            to the wine-supply of 1877. The Douro vintage this year has been made;
                            but the quantity is inferior, although a little better than that of
                            1876, which is the worst there has been since 1869. The wines of 1877,
                            particularly the lowest qualities, have been selling at very high
                            prices, not only as regards the usual prices every year, but also as
                            regards quality. Taking the quality into account, the prices are
                            exorbitant. This is owing to the great scarcity of production in other
                            provinces, which the Douro district is supplying; a very large
                            exportation to Brazil; and, lastly, the great increase in the home
                            consumption. The inevitable consequence is the great rise in the price
                            of brandy, which is £12 per pipe dearer than in 1871, and it is believed
                            it will still rise £9 or £10 more per pipe during the course of the
                            year. This will necessarily have an effect upon prices of young wines,
                            treated with the proper brandy, and it will tell upon the cheapest wines
                            rather severely.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The statements and other general
                            information herewith respectfully submitted, showing the condition of
                            trade and commerce at this port, are only such as could be prepared
                            during the brief time spared from other pressing engagements. As no such
                            commercial reports have, to my knowledge, been heretofore sent from this
                            commercial agency, I did not expect to be required to furnish anything
                            of the kind, until receipt of circular “Separate,” bearing date of
                            August 16, 1877, from the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>This circular reached me on the 7th instant, only one week since;
                            consequently, while said statements may be regarded as accurate as far
                            as they go, they are not as full and complete nor are they tabulated in
                            the manner I would wish to present them to the Department.</p>
                        <p>The growing importance of our port also demands a fuller and more
                            comprehensive report than I can give in the limited time now at my
                            command.</p>
                        <pb facs="0867" n="133" xml:id="pg_133"/>
                        <p>The geographical position of Samana, its commodious and perfectly secure
                            anchorage, and the configuration of the island generally, clearly point
                            out our port as the natural principal outlet for the produce of this
                            republic.</p>
                        <p>The Yuna River draining a large portion of the “Vega Real,” the most
                            fertile district of the island, discharges its waters into Samana Bay at
                            a point some 25 miles from this town. This river is tortuous, has an
                            average width of 25 to 30 yards, and has a shallow bar at its mouth,
                            which once passed, a sufficient depth of unobstructed navigable water
                            for all the purposes of traffic is found for a considerable distance
                            toward its source. The improvement of this stream, particularly at its
                            mouth, is now engaging the attention of one of our principal business
                            firms, who expect to secure a considerable amount of produce, which at
                            present goes overland to Puerto Plata at an expense of carriage much
                            greater than would be required to deliver the produce at this port for
                            shipment abroad. The views of these gentlemen appear to me to be sound.
                            I have on one occasion ascended the river in a small steam-launch as far
                            as Almacen, some 50 miles distant by water from its mouth; of course
                            this distance is very much shorter “as the crow flies.”</p>
                        <p>We have three lines of steamers touching regularly at Samana, viz: The
                            Royal Mail Steam-packet Company’s steamers (British), arriving
                            bimonthly; the Hamburgh American Steamship Company’s steamers (German),
                            bimonthly; and Messrs. Clyde &amp; Co., of New York, run their steamship
                            Tybee constantly between that city and the different ports of this
                            island, the latter vessel arriving on no fixed dates, but making on an
                            average about ten trips per year; a Spanish line of steamers is also
                            soon to touch here. The British and German steamers connect at St.
                            Thomas, with steamers of their own lines, respectively, for Europe
                            direct, the bulk of the tobacco crop (the chief staple of export of
                            Santo Domingo) being sent to Hamburg and Bremen.</p>
                        <p>Business in all branches has been very dull during the whole of the past
                            year, the principal causes being— <list>
                                <label>1st.</label>
                                <item>The constant revolutionary movements, which, since January,
                                    1876, have distracted the country, and which tend to seriously
                                    operate against the extension of business in any direction on
                                    the part of our merchants.</item>
                                <label>2d.</label>
                                <item>The small crop of last year amounting to (more or less) 60,000
                                    seroons, of which the exceedingly small quantity of 7,500
                                    seroons only were shipped from this port. This, together with
                                    the reason stated under No. 1, has caused the merchants of the
                                    interior to limit their importations to articles only strictly
                                    necessary.</item>
                                <label>3d.</label>
                                <item>The suspension of payment to the government officials and
                                    employés, and the remission hence to the capital of all the
                                    custom-house revenue, thus drawing the little money formerly in
                                    circulation away from our place.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The crop of this year has disappointed our expectations, as an unusually
                            large yield was confidently predicted in the early part of the season.
                            In the Santiago district the crop will be abundant. In Mocha and La Vega
                            it has turned out small, consequently Puerto Plata will have the benefit
                            of the large yield of the Santiago district. The total crop will
                            probably reach 100,000 seroons, of which some 10,000 will go forward
                            from this port.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the small amount of importations of last year and the beginning
                            of this (for which a further reason is found in the fact of all duties
                            being now required to be paid in cash), the exportations will doubtless
                            considerably-exceed the value of the imports, thus enabling our
                            merchants <pb facs="0868" n="134" xml:id="pg_134"/> to fulfill any
                            unsettled obligations they may have in St. Thomas, from which place our
                            stocks, particularly in lines of dry-goods, are to a considerable extent
                            filled up.</p>
                        <p>Duties could formerly be paid in part with “valés” or “pagarés” against
                            the government, which paper could be purchased at 40 per cent. to 60 per
                            cent. discount by the merchant, and was accepted at the custom-house at
                            par. The new order of the administration, requiring all cash in payment
                            of duties, has had the effect of diminishing in a measure importations,
                            as before stated.</p>
                        <p>Import duty is fixed at 40 per cent., with 6 per cent. off, equivalent to
                            34 per cent. on goods arriving direct at Dominican ports from the
                            countries in which they were produced or manufactured; this duty is not
                            calculated upon the values indicated in the invoice presented by the
                            merchant, but on the values fixed by government as specified in its
                            published “Arancel,” and which values often vary very considerably from
                            the actual ones. Machinery, agricultural implements, books and printed
                            matter generally, and breeding stock are admitted free of duty. Zinc and
                            other metallic roofing was to have been also admitted free, but whether
                            the decree to that effect has been issued, I am unable for the moment to
                            state.</p>
                        <p>The manner in which the present government is canceling the interior debt
                            is inflicting a severe wound upon the interest of the merchants. Claims
                            against the government are now divided into two classes, the “deuda
                            deferida,” and the “deuda moderna,” the latter being the preferred, and
                            to be first extinguished. Government obligations classed “deferida” can
                            be converted into the “deuda moderna” by a loss of 50 per cent. of the
                            face of the claim, and the obligations classed “moderna,” are being
                            bought in by the government, at stated intervals, holders offering their
                            claims by tender, the lowest being accepted; the price paid being
                            generally about 10 per cent. of the nominal value of the claim. Thus the
                            holder of a “deferida” obligation gets but 5 cents on the dollar. This
                            is probably the nearest approach to declared repudiation (with a saving
                            clause) ever achieved by any government. Yet the present administration
                            takes much pride in exhibiting to the outside world the large amount of
                            the interior debt now being extinguished. It is needless to add that
                            holders of government paper to a very large amount prefer to keep their
                            claims locked up rather than present them for settlement on the above
                            terms by this government, with the hope that a new administration will
                            deal more justly with them.</p>
                        <p>A shipment of coin from the United States arrived at the capital a short
                            time since, destined for circulation in this country. This coin (one
                            cent pieces) has not as yet, however, been used, as the merchants are
                            strongly adverse to this measure of the government, and-with good
                            reason, as there is no guarantee that the advertised amount only will be
                            put into circulation. It can be readily seen that the metal of the new
                            coin is base, and probably not worth one half of its nominal value.
                            Information recently reached here by means of a printed circular from
                            New York, in which it is stated that the new coins were not issued from
                            any mint, but were fabricated in a factory of buttons, and other
                            articles of copper, bronze, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>For many years past the bay and peninsula of Samana have at different
                            times attracted the attention of the American people. The beautiful, the
                            magnificent natural scenery, the wonderful fertility of the soil,
                            &amp;c., have been set forth in glowing terms; all such descriptions
                            however should be, and probably are, taken (by prudent people) <hi

                            the tropics, are apt to be over-enthusiastic in such descriptions, which
                            generally speaking, convey wrong impressions. As I purpose, however, to
                            transmit to the Department another paper for this mail, in which the
                            comparative productiveness of the soil of Santo Domingo will be more
                            particularly enlarged upon, I close this report with the hope that it
                            may, taken in connection with the accompanying inclosures, be found to
                            meet, in a measure at least, the requirements of the service; and with

                                may be calculated that the value of the exports for the current year

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Department’s circular
                            concerning the possibilities of increasing trade between the United
                            States and other countries of the world, I beg to present the following
                            considerations concerning Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>Switzerland is a small country, only 50,000 square miles in extent, and
                            possibly one-fifth of this area, even, is composed of high mountains,
                                <pb facs="0871" n="137" xml:id="pg_137"/> snow-fields, and lakes.
                            The population does not quite reach, three millions; but, deducting the
                            uninhabitable regions of the country, it is crowded to about 75 persons
                            to the square mile. Again, a very great proportion of the land is only
                            fit for pasturage and grass. Hence, here is a busy people crowded into a
                            non-agricultural country, and relying almost wholly on other lands for
                            their wheat, their corn, their oats, and their meat. Here are the very
                            articles of which the United States has a surplus; Switzerland must and
                            does buy these things, and it only becomes a question of how to get them
                            here that need concern Americans for a moment. Again, Switzerland has no
                            coal; every pound used for her factories, her steamers, her locomotives,
                            and for heating, is bought in Saarbrück, Germany, and brought here by
                            rail; and, further, she has no wood; it, too, is nearly all imported
                            from Germany; so that her material for burning must all be purchased
                            outside. She uses of coal ten million hundred-weight per year; this coal
                            costs, delivered here, at least 35 francs per ton. If coal could be had
                            cheaper, the amount consumed might be doubled, as wood is terrifically
                            dear, nine to ten dollars per cord. She imports about five million
                            hundred-weight of wheat per year, a million hundred-weight of rye, oats,
                            and barley, a quarter of a million hundredweight of corn, and as much of
                            meal; all these from Hungary, six hundred miles away. Her wheat costs
                            her $2.20 per bushel j her meal costs $2.25 per hundred-weight; her
                            flour $5 per hundred-weight; oats $2 per hundred-weight. Notwithstanding
                            her abundance of grass, she imports her meat, as the cattle here are
                            used for the dairy and for work.</p>
                        <p>No country can produce these necessities cheaper than the United States
                            can, if we except England as to coal only. No country can put them into
                            Switzerland cheaper, even with the difference of freight in their favor,
                            provided we only had the opportunity. This opportunity would consist in
                            having a line of strong freight-ships to Genoa or Marseilles, and proper
                            arrangements with the Italian railway lines for cheap forwarding. The
                            sending of freight-ships to Genoa would seem to have an especial
                            advantage on the completion of the St. Gothard tunnel through the Alps.
                            This tunnel will be completed in three years, and will, as a matter of
                            course, result in cheapening freights from the Mediterranean to
                            Switzerland. I have mentioned only the principal American products which
                            could find great sale here were the question of freights settled.</p>
                        <p>There are still other items in which America could more than compete in
                            Switzerland; I refer to tools, cutlery, some farming implements, axes,
                            spades, scythes, lawn-mowers, scales, locks, &amp;c. These articles as
                            made here are both poor and dear. With agricultural machinery little can
                            be done; the farms are too small and too hilly, and the farmers too poor
                            to buy. Household implements and utensils, such as sewing-machines,
                            washing-machines, and wringers, would be in demand, if good. Petroleum,
                            cotton, and sewing-machines are already imported here largely, but
                            seldom directly from America. Our provision list contains much that the
                            Swiss would gladly buy; hams, canned fruits, canned vegetables, meat,
                            lard, &amp;c. But to establish trade in Switzerland there are many
                            obstacles to overcome; the people are not only old-fashioned, they are
                            dreadfully prejudiced against all innovations in the ways of doing
                            things. I think I know farmers who drive four or five cows to an old
                            wooden mold-board plow, who turn over but a quarter of an acre a day,
                            who would not try a bright steel plow and a pair of horses were they to
                            be given to them. Patience will be required, and disappointment at first
                            will have to be borne. The easiest method to establish the sale of
                            American manufactured articles in Switzerland would be to send specimens
                                <pb facs="0872" n="138" xml:id="pg_138"/> with prices to the
                            permanent industrial exhibitions or museums There are no charges for
                            space.</p>
                        <p>The article must be put at the door free of expense to the society, and
                            it can remain on exhibition indefinitely. These permanent exhibitions
                            are in Zurich, Winterthur, and Basel, and soon will be in other large
                            Swiss towns. I judge that the consul, if requested to look after
                            articles so exhibited, would do so with pleasure; I have spoken of what
                            we Americans ought to <hi rend="italic">sell</hi>to Switzerland, and I
                            now come to what we ought to <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> from her. We
                            are, first of all, an agricultural people; the Swiss live by their
                            manufactures. I am told, every day, that they ought to be selling us
                            more than they do, but that we wont let them; our laws, even, won’t let
                            them; and that, too, when we are asking them to buy of us.</p>
                        <p>Trade is jealous, like individuals. Grocer Smith won’t buy his shoes of
                            neighbor Jones, if neighbor Jones dont buy his groceries of Smith. If we
                            would like to sell our wheat, and petroleum, and corn, and cotton, and
                            cutlery to Switzerland, who has use for them, and really wants them,
                            common usage of trade will say we must buy of her in return. The first
                            great industry of Switzerland is silk.</p>
                        <p>Zürich, indeed, is the second silk manufacturing city of the world. One
                            of the greatest consumers of silk is America, and yet it is claimed,
                            with certainly a great appearance of justice, that, in order to support
                            a small number of silk manufacturers in New Jersey, we, to a large
                            extent, refuse to buy of Switzerland, or at least to buy <hi
                                rend="italic">fairly</hi>; that is, we grant subsidies, for high
                            duty on a certain article is a subsidy, to those who are making Swiss
                            articles in our country.</p>
                        <p>“Abolish your subsidies, then,” says Switzerland, “put us on an even
                            footing with you as to trade, and we will guarantee to furnish all the
                            silk your people want at a very much lower price than you at present pay
                            for it, and we will make money in the business at that, and we will feel
                            encouraged to buy your surplus grains or whatever you may have to sell.
                            You are not silk makers, we are; let the shoemaker stick to his last,
                            and the tailor to his goose. We have made silk for two centuries; a
                            large part of our people are skilled in this; we know the best methods
                            and have the cheapest labor. You are benefited if we can give you a
                            thing cheaper than you can make it yourself. Because you have succeeded
                            in doing many things, you aspire to do all. This is what China thought
                            two thousand years ago, and so she elevated her tariff, the shape of her
                            great wall, and she closed her doors to barbarian and civilized alike,
                            and she killed those who ventured to knock at her doors; at last she
                            killed herself with too much home industry and too much protection, it
                            is believed. You think because you have done much by machines you may
                            yet do everything. There are some things that machines can’t do and do
                            well. They have not got the delicate touch of a woman’s fingers or the
                            secret skill of an experienced dyer—things that are requisite to make
                            silk well.</p>
                        <p>“Stone-coal, steam, and machines are cheaper than muscle of men, but they
                            can’t always take the place of men and women; if they could, sorrowful
                            would be the day.”</p>
                        <p>In short, only a few qualities of silk can be made really well by
                            machinery at all, the threads of the raw material being usually too
                            delicate and the fine finish to the stuff other than by hand impossible.
                            In weaving by hand the fingers of the weaver can do what the machine
                            never can accomplish; that is, watch the breaks and remove the knots and
                            clean away the imperfections. Besides, were it to be admitted that
                            machines could make fully as good silk as skilled weavers can, still it
                                <pb facs="0873" n="139" xml:id="pg_139"/> would not be cheaper silk.
                            The reasons are obvious; first, those who manufacture silk by hand have
                            it done on private looms in the houses of the farmers, whose wives and
                            daughters weave on rainy days and between times; second, there is little
                            capital invested, and hence the risk is smaller; third, in times when
                            the demand for silk lags or ceases, there are no costly machines to
                            stand idle or else work at a loss; there are no great factories to
                            close; no hundreds of workmen to be dismissed and, as goods are woven by
                            the piece, there are no strikes. The production is simply lowered when
                            prices fall, and when the market improves the farmer’s family return to
                            the loom. The loss has at least been divided, and nobody is ruined. A
                            partial reduction of production is impossible to machinery without loss.
                            There are, perhaps, a thousand steam-looms near Zürich, and during the
                            late and present crises of the silk-market those who have made silk by
                            machines have suffered immensely more than those who made by hand.
                            Again, some silk manufacturers weave both by hand and by steam-machines
                            here, and I have been informed repeatedly that the cost to them
                            whichever way they weave is not materially different. I am pretty
                            thoroughly convinced that could manufacturers here have their money back
                            they would not again put it into machine-looms for weaving silk. All
                            this indicates that silk-weaving by machinery cannot hope to compete
                            with silk-weaving by hand, either as to price or quality; and, if silk
                            is to be woven by hand, Americans cannot hope to compete with the cheap
                            labor of Switzerland and France, unless they are protected by at least
                            60 per cent. duty. To protect them by such a duty is to take the money
                            out of the pockets of the consumers and to put it into the silk-looms—I
                            will not say the pockets of American weavers.</p>
                        <p>That nothing less than 60 per cent. duty or subsidy can save them is
                            evident from the fact that they barely keep their heads above water as
                            it is. We import about twenty-five million dollars’ worth of silk
                            annually. To get to use this, silk-consumers pay $15,000,000 per year,
                            and then do not supply themselves as cheaply as they could were this
                            enormous sum of duty not paid at all.</p>
                        <p>We pay this $15,000,000 mainly that a few manufacturers, not over two
                            hundred in number, may go on experimenting with silk-weaving. Suppose
                            this sum were expended to aid ship lines, in order that we might get our
                            own products out to the world instead of trying to prevent the world’s
                            products from getting into us. Of course the United States must have a
                            revenue from some source or other, direct or indirect; but, leaving the
                            question of the policy of levying such high duties out of consideration
                            entirely, it is still maintainable that this same $15,000,000 would be
                            had with a silk duty of 35 or 40 per cent., for this lower amount of
                            duty would preclude the idea of profit from smuggling, and the result
                            would be, the millions of dollars worth now smuggled in through a
                            hundred different channels would be regularly entered and would pay
                            duty.</p>
                        <p>It is interesting to notice to what an extent Europeans in silk districts
                            have given up the production of raw silk and are restricting themselves
                            wholly to manufacturing silk stuffs. In 1849 France produced 25,000,000
                            kilograms of raw silk; in 1868 the production had fallen off to
                            11,000,000 kilograms, and now it is down to 6,500,000 kilograms.</p>
                        <p>Spain, too, formerly a large silk-producing state, now delivers but a
                            little over a million kilograms per year; Italy alone continuing to
                            produce as usual.</p>
                        <p>In fact, countries in which ordinary farming pays cannot afford to turn
                            attention to feeding the silk-worm or spinning the raw silk, as the two
                                <pb facs="0874" n="140" xml:id="pg_140"/> great requirements for
                            success in spinning are, first, great cleverness of employés; and,
                            second, a possibility of securing labor at extremely low prices. Here in
                            Switzerland silk-weavers are content to earn 30 to 40 cents a day on
                            their own looms, or 50 to 60 cents a day if weaving at the mechanical
                            looms in factories.</p>
                        <p>Spinners in Italy work from 10 cents a day to 25 cents a day, and
                            possibly as cheap or cheaper in China and Japan.</p>
                        <p>What I have wished to do in this paper was to represent some certain
                            facts, leaving those interested to draw their own conclusions; remarking
                            only that by legislation alone does it seem possible for us to greatly
                            change the status of trade between the two countries. If our duties on
                            Swiss industries were lower, so that they could be sold to us at the
                            cost of manufacturing, and if we had cheap methods of sending our own
                            products directly to Switzerland in return, the problem would be
                            solved.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The separate dispatch of August 7, 1877,
                            from the Department of State, devolves upon the diplomatic officers of
                            the government, jointly with the consular officers, a duty which
                            hitherto has been mainly borne by the latter—the collection of
                            commercial information, especially with reference to the question of
                            methods by which trade with the United States can be most judiciously
                            fostered.</p>
                        <p>Turkey is naturally very rich and her commerce great, although the Turks
                            themselves are not given to trade, and their system does not encourage
                            it. The burdens of the government fall chiefly upon productions, so that
                            the heaviest exactions are made from industry and enterprise. Repeated
                            statements of the shares accruing respectively to the laborer and to the
                            tax-gatherer, exhibit a disproportion too incredible for such a paper as
                            this. It is not a fancy to depict the wealth that would accrue under a
                            system like those which have enriched other countries, notably our own,
                            where taxes are imposed on consumption and luxurious indulgence. At
                            present agriculture retrogrades, manufactures dwindle, and commerce is
                            in foreign hands.</p>
                        <p>The trade with the East, especially with Persia, is considerable, and is
                            carried on by caravans either to this city or to some sea-port within
                            easy communication. The Western trade is done chiefly in large iron
                            steamers from London and Liverpool, from Marseilles, from Trieste (the
                            Austrian Lloyds), and from Naples and other Italian ports, all built, I
                            believe, in England, and therefore more or less subsidiary to her. More
                            than eighty such steamers, varying from 600 tons to 6,000 tons each, are
                            advertised from England alone. I inclose the advertisements for more
                            specific information. British interests in Turkey are commercially very
                            great. The Mediterranean steamers ply regularly and carry passengers,
                            especially the Messageries Maritimes (Marseilles) and the Austrian <pb
                                facs="0875" n="141" xml:id="pg_141"/> Lloyds; the English steamers
                            carry very few; for, although the fare is less than by the overland
                            routes, the voyage is longer, and, outside the Straits of Gibraltar,
                            much rougher. These ships, for the most part, come laden with
                            merchandise, and return with cargoes of grain, for which they frequently
                            go into the Black Sea. It is with this unequal competition that our
                            grain-producers have to contend, a competition suspended for the moment
                            by the war. The lands of the East are very fertile, the quality of the
                            grain superior, labor very cheap, and freight low. Only in the methods
                            of handling have our countrymen the advantage.</p>
                        <p>The direct trade from America is confined almost entirely to petroleum
                            and arms and ammunition. The former is usually brought in American
                            sailing-vessels, the latter in British steamers. There is some indirect
                            trade through England, from which our people seem to derive little
                            either of credit or of profit. Hams, cheese, and some other articles
                            familiar to the American eye, are found in the markets, where they pass
                            for English. Our cottons have also been brought in limited quantities,
                            much admired for their texture and finish, and readily sold. When I
                            first came I was attracted by the street-hawkers crying American cloth.
                            By inquiry I found that it came originally from the United States, and
                            acquired a reputation and the name, both of which were subsequently
                            appropriated by English manufacturers, who supplanted it in the market
                            by a much poorer fabric, at a little lower price. Sewing-machines and
                            clocks are not uncommon. Iron stoves of American make are sometimes
                            seen, though the porcelain stoves, generally used on the continent of
                            Europe, seem to be preferred, indeed are preferable, being cheaper and
                            more ornamental, and imparting a more agreeable warmth. There is some
                            traffic in distilled spirits, chiefly rum. Our trade in these articles I
                            am satisfied might, with proper diligence, be greatly enlarged, and
                            extended to many other things Cottons, both colored and uncolored, for
                            example, might be introduced in considerable quantities, the former
                            being adapted in style and pattern to the habits and traditional tastes
                            of the people. So, too, the smaller implements of husbandry, edge-tools,
                            fancy weapons, ordnance stores of various kinds, clocks, carriages, and
                            numerous other things which the practical mercantile eye would discover.
                            On the other hand, there are, in different parts of the empire, the
                            elements of a return trade. Arabian horses and Angora goats might be
                            profitably introduced into our country, the former to cross on the
                            American stock, the latter for their fine silken fleece; and the buffalo
                                (<hi rend="italic">Bos bubalus</hi>) as a beast of draught, heavier
                            and more powerful than the common ox, and, I should think, better
                            adapted to the warmer districts. Sheep for hybridizing with our native
                            growth might be selected from the different breeds of the East, where
                            they so abound that one might think it the land of their origin; the
                            same flocks are seen to-day that have existed hundreds of years,
                            furnishing the shambles with abundant and superior mutton, and the looms
                            with the staple of many a beautiful and durable fabric. One variety,
                            distinguished by a broad, adipose tail, attains great size, and is much
                            esteemed for the excellence of its fleece. Wool, both on the skin and in
                            the fleece, goats’ hair, and goat skins, occur in this connection as
                            important articles of traffic. I may add, as pertaining to the domain of
                            agriculture, raw silk from Broossa; figs, licorice, and opium from
                            Smyrna; and attar of roses from the southern slopes of the Balkans;
                            olives, olive-wood, and olive-oil, from the Sporadic Islands and all
                            along the Asiatic coast; and tobacco for smoking, from the district of
                            which Salonica is the center. Grapes everywhere abound, rare and
                            delicious, from which are produced wines, to my taste superior to the
                            common red wines of France or the white table-wines of Germany, <pb
                                facs="0876" n="142" xml:id="pg_142"/> more nearly resembling the
                            vintages of the Spanish peninsula, but lighter. Lady Mary Wortley
                            Montague, who in 1717 was here with her husband, then English
                            ambassador, writing of Bulgaria, speaks of drinking several sorts of
                            delicious wine; and says she was “assured the quantity of wine last
                            vintage was so prodigious that they were forced to dig holes in the
                            earth to put it in, not having vessels enough to hold it.” All agree
                            that the wine production, considerable as it now is, falls immeasurably
                            below that of former times, and below the present capacity of the
                            country if adequately encouraged. Dye-stuffs, both for the primary and
                            the intermediate colors, must be found here if we may judge from the
                            many-hued textiles constantly seen, retaining their brilliancy until
                            quite worn out. The Tyrian dyes are among the undiscoverable secrets of
                            antiquity. Probably then as now technical skill had something to do in
                            attaining the gorgeous results.</p>
                        <p>The manufactures of Turkey, which once were numerous and very rich, are
                            now few. The theory that to sell to others we must buy from them, and
                            the practice of buying in the cheapest market, here find ample
                            illustration. Instead of spinning their cotton into yarn upon the
                            distaff, as formerly, they ship their cotton to England, and receive
                            yarn and inferior cloth in return. In 1873, the latest report at hand,
                            they exported to Great Britain, of cotton, £200,884; they imported from
                            Great Britain, of cottons and cotton yarns, £5,828,869. The woolen
                            industry is diminished in equal ratio and from similar causes. The
                            fleeces of Angora, once wrought by the native women into garments of
                            comfort, grace, and beauty, are now shipped to England, and the
                            traditionary skill has declined. The exports thither amounted in 1873 to
                            £752,621. The old fabrics, half worn, but still retaining their delicate
                            colors and displaying their elegant forms, are sold in the bazaars to
                            strangers as precious relics of a departed antiquity. Mr. Gueschoff,
                            United States consular agent at Philippopolis, says: “Forty years ago
                            the manufacture of the coarse woolen cloths called abbas, and of the
                            woolen braid called Ghaitan, as well as the production of ready-made
                            clothes, had attained an importance which marked out this district as
                            one of the most industrial provinces of European Turkey. Since the
                            Crimean war, however, the spurious refinement which has produced a
                            change in costume, and the light duties levied by the Turkish fisc on
                            foreign goods “(8 per cent., payable in cash or in kind), “a policy by
                            which Turkey has sought to win the support of the Western European
                            powers, have gradually diminished the production of these staple
                                articles.”.—(<ref target="frus1876#pg_588">Foreign Relations, 1876,
                                p. 588</ref>.)</p>
                        <p>These remarks apply with equal force to the manufactures of silk and of
                            iron and steel. Texier, an accurate French writer, has described the
                            silk manufactures of Broossa, keeping busy the households of that
                            ancient capital, magnificent brocades rich with flowers of silver and
                            gold, for the exclusive use of the harems of Constantinople; stuffs for
                            dresses and for furniture, washing like linen and more durable than
                            woolen; and gauzes filmy, nebulous, and almost as impalpable as
                            gossamer. These goods were never seen in France, because excluded by
                            prohibitive duties, and of course were unknown in the realm of fashion,
                            of which the center and mistress has long been the French capital.
                            Damascus gave her name to a well-known style of silk fabrics. She also
                            enjoys an ancient fame for the temper and finish of her blades,
                            unsurpassed and unrivaled except perhaps in Spain. Specimens of that
                            renowned cutlery which have outlasted both hilt and scabbard command
                            this day astonishing prices. Of these decaying and nearly forgotten
                            industries there are remnants that would prove interesting and
                            profitable to our <pb facs="0877" n="143" xml:id="pg_143"/> countrymen.
                            The various silk fabrics from Broossa and Damascus, silk lace rare and
                            very costly from Smyrna, towels and bathing-costumes of cotton plush;
                            woven also in Broossa, of which English imitations are sometimes found
                            in our markets under the name of Turkish towels, and, above all,
                            carpets, a commodity deserving mention. No product of native skill,
                            taste, and industry combined is found in such abundance and variety. Two
                            styles prevail, the Persian and the Turkish. The commerce from the East
                            is enriched with carpets and rugs, each peculiar and different from all
                            the others in size, pattern, and quality, made in Daghostan, in
                            Turkistan, in Khorassan, in Teheran, in Bokhara, generically similar but
                            specifically unlike. Carpets and carpeting are made both in European and
                            Asiatic Turkey. The best—those usually found in the imperial palaces and
                            in the houses of the rich—are brought from Smyrna, and are known
                            commercially as Smyrna carpets. They are not produced there, however,
                            but at Oshak, some distance in the interior, where this beautiful
                            industry which gave celebrity to ancient Phrygia has been preserved to
                            this day, owing to the abundance of wool and dye-stuffs. They are the
                            work of Greek women upon the simplest contrivances, but with the
                            matchless ingenuity and taste that seem to be natural attributes of that
                            race. The shawls and embroideries must not be overlooked. Of the methods
                            by which this trade may be fostered two seem the most important.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First. The establishment, by our merchants, of business agencies,
                                to be filled by intelligent and trustworthy American young men.
                                Experience has demonstrated that the natives cannot be depended
                                upon, either as agents or as partners. They know nothing of our
                                country and its wants; and their habits of business are so totally
                                unlike ours as to unfit them for the correspondence of our
                                merchants, though sometimes very successful both at home and abroad.
                                What I mean to say is, they are not qualified for the special
                                service indicated, nor would any European be, for a similar reason.
                                Such agencies would be quick to discover any articles adapted to
                                American wants and tastes, and especially what American products
                                would suit the wants and tastes of this people. Our countrymen
                                sometimes fall into the mistake of sending abroad novelties and what
                                are valued at home as improvements, instead of conforming to the
                                requirements of the people with whom they would establish trade.
                                This mistake is especially serious in a conservative unprogressive
                                country like this, where there has been, apparently, but little
                                change in the popular life since the epochs of Moses and Hesiod.
                                Texier, whom I have already cited, says the chamber of commerce of
                                the city of Lyons wondered for a long time why so few of their
                                fabrics could be sold in the East. At length the French
                                manufacturers adopted oriental designs for their cottons and their
                                silks, and their trade became considerable. This is a point which
                                cannot be easily overstated. These agencies I have indicated would,
                                I am persuaded, prove an excellent school for the American
                                merchant.</item>
                            <item>Second. The establishment of direct communication by American
                                steamers between this city and the United States. The frequency of
                                the trips, the intermediate stoppages and other details, would
                                require careful consideration. Immediate profit could not be
                                expected; an unfavorable balance would be more likely, at least for
                                a time. Such an enterprise would be proper only when supported by
                                capital which could afford to wait for its return until a business
                                should grow. This would eventually happen beyond a doubt, and in
                                addition to remunerating the outlay would secure to our countrymen
                                the indirect advantage of a profitable commerce. The example of
                                England in this respect is worthy of <pb facs="0878" n="144"
                                    xml:id="pg_144"/> imitation. Her steamers go not only where
                                trade is established, but where it is deemed practicable to
                                establish it; they run, too, in her own exclusive interest, and no
                                other nation need expect to profit by them. No matter how many ships
                                we may build or own, until our merchants are prepared to sail them
                                with an eye to ultimate results, as well as to current receipts, we
                                cannot expect to rival the commercial fleets of that enterprising,
                                untiring, and far-sighted power.</item>

                        <p>On a hasty survey of our commerce with Turkey, it would seem that there
                            are but few objects the trade in which could be developed. We do not
                            need Turkish cereals nor cotton. Our imports of wool depend in a very
                            great measure on the rate of duty imposed upon those articles by our
                            customs-laws. Our importation of gums and drugs depends strictly upon
                            the demand, which is limited to a small class. It would be hardly
                            possible or wise for us to increase the consumption in America of opium.
                            Little, therefore, would seem to be left except figs.</p>
                        <p>As to our exports to Turkey, they consist now chiefly of arms and
                            -ammunition, sent there for the most part in pursuance of contracts made
                            some years ago. It is, of course, to be expected that as soon as the war
                            shall have finished, the trade in these articles will cease, as the
                            Turks will no doubt have a sufficient supply on hand for use in any
                            subsequent struggle. Other articles in which a traffic, might
                            advantageously arise are cutlery, tools, machines, cotton goods and
                            prints and cloths.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, owing to the backward state of the Turkish Empire in every
                            respect, little or no use is to be found for machines, especially for
                            agricultural machines as the agriculture of the country has not yet
                            reached a point at which they could successfully or profitably be
                            employed. As far as cutlery and tools are concerned, those of American
                            make, while appreciated, seem to be too dear for this market, as they
                            are crowded out by German wares of an exceedingly inferior quality. Most
                            of the ordinary cutlery employed by the natives, both Turks and
                            Christians, is of indigenous manufacture, various villages in the
                            interior being specially renowned for some particular branch of this
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>Among these I may cite Gabrovo, on the north of the Balkans, now in the
                            hands of the Russians, where there were many manufacturers on a small
                            scale of cutlery, knives, scythes, axes, &amp;c., who had a large trade
                            over the country north and even south of the Balkans.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that a large and profitable market could be found in this
                            country for American prints and cotton goods. Great quantities of such
                            articles are imported from Europe, and especially from England. For
                            this, however, it would be necessary that more direct means of
                            communication should be established between Turkey and the United
                            States, and that our manufacturers should, to some extent, study Turkish
                            patterns <pb facs="0879" n="145" xml:id="pg_145"/> and Turkish tastes,
                            and imitate them in respect to color, design, and even the width and
                            length of the pieces.</p>
                        <p>I have elsewhere called attention to the number of steamers which run
                            between foreign ports and Constantinople, partly because the number of
                            steamers is indicative of the foreign trade, and partly because, by
                            giving foreign trade the possibility of speedy and regular arrival in
                            Turkey, they serve to increase it.</p>
                        <p>In the present state of communication between Turkey and America it would
                            be very difficult to start any commerce with cotton goods.</p>
                        <p>The exporters would be at a disadvantage as compared to England in
                            freights, transhipment, and double commissions, and in receiving their
                            payments by having in most cases to take bills of exchange on England
                            and France, thus losing another commission.</p>
                        <p>On several occasions I have been asked to aid in introducing objects of
                            American manufacture into foreign countries, and have always done what I
                            could in the way of advice or in communicating the result of my
                            observations. I have, however, always found one obstacle—the apparently
                            ingrained belief of American manufacturers that they know better than
                            their customers what is wanted. They frequently seem to be unwilling to
                            make the slightest concession to the tastes of the purchasers, or to
                            take at all into account the character of the people or of the country,
                            or oven the regulations of the government which may not allow articles
                            to be sold or used unless of some specified design in some particulars.
                            For instance, a manufacturer of street-cars lost a large and lucrative
                            contract because he was unwilling to supply wheels for a certain kind of
                            rails, and to conform to certain other specifications of the car which
                            were imposed upon the company by the government. He claimed that his
                            long experience had proved to him that these were not good. A
                            manufacturer of locomotives, in the same way, was unable to obtain a
                            contract, although the company much preferred to buy of him, because he
                            refused to conform to specifications which were laid down by the
                            ministry of railways. In a country where the government interferes with
                            public works and commerce, as it does in several countries in Europe,
                            and especially in a country like Turkey, where the people are
                            conservative, and where they have tastes and modes of life far different
                            from those of America or civilized Europe, it would be extremely
                            difficult to insure success in any trade unless a certain conformity be
                            given to their tastes and prejudices. Another hinderance which exists
                            here is that many people are so conservative that they prefer to buy
                            even an inferior quality of goods made by a manufacturer with whose name
                            they are acquainted. American prints and cotton goods are generally
                            firmer and of closer texture and better quality than any of the native
                            goods or any of foreign manufacture which are imported.</p>
                        <p>I hope soon to be able to make a more detailed report with regard to the
                            importation of cotton goods into Turkey, and will then endeavor to
                            inclose samples showing the general designs, colors, and patterns which
                            are most suited to the Turkish taste.</p>

                                persia</hi>.</p>
                        <p>An opening for a trade in American manufactures would apparently be found
                            in Persia. I do not now have at hand all the figures and facts on which
                            my belief is founded. It is based in great measure on a survey of the
                            Persian trade which I made some years ago, and on conversations with
                            intelligent Persians and foreigners who have visited Persia for
                            commercial purposes. The Persian embassy in St. Petersburg, to whom I
                            presented some gentlemen interested in the subject, entered <pb
                                facs="0880" n="146" xml:id="pg_146"/> very warmly into the idea. I
                            was told that the Persian Government disliked a commercial dependence
                            either on England or Russia; that it would hail with delight the
                            introduction into Persia of American capital, or at least capital
                            managed by Americans and under American control; and that it would give
                            every facility to Americans by granting them concessions which the
                            jealousy of Russia and England prevented being given to the subjects of
                            either. For this end it was thought desirable for our government to send
                            a special commissioner to Teheran, or at least establish a consulate at
                            Bender Bushir on the Persian Gulf, or at Bassora (Basra). Of course it
                            is impossible to trust to vague promises of this kind, no matter by whom
                            they may be inspired, but there is much truth in the statement that the
                            clashing of foreign influences in Persia is detrimental to the
                            development of the country. As a single example I cite the fact of the
                            concession for railways granted a few years ago by the Persian
                            Government to Baron Reuter, an English subject, being canceled through
                            intrigues having their origin in the Russian legation at Teheran and the
                            foreign office at St. Petersburg. The Russians feared lest, by means of
                            this concession, English influence should become paramount in Persia.
                            Under such circumstances, perhaps Americans, who have no political aims
                            upon the country, might come between the jealous rivals and gain a
                            commercial advantage.</p>
                        <p>Any American trade with Persia would necessarily have to be carried on by
                            the Persian Gulf, and the first requisite would be the establishment of
                            a consul at Bender-Bushir (as is allowed by the treaty of 1856) to
                            protect the traders from improper interference, and have jurisdiction
                            over them. The route through the Black Sea, and via the Transcaucasus or
                            the Caspian, to Persia, would be too long for American trade, and
                            subjected, both in Turkey and in Russia, to vexatious exactions and
                            delays, besides being in Russian hands. Those via Trebizond and via
                            Aleppo are even worse, and are becoming disused.</p>
                        <p>The trade of Russia with Persia via the Caspian and the Transcaucasus,
                            for 1872, 1873, and 1874, averaged yearly, exports $ 1,350,000, imports
                            $3,525,000. The transit trade of other nations with Persia, through Poti
                            inwards, was, in 1875, about $1,500,000.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the unwise measures of the Russian Government, from 1821 on,
                            Trebizond became the central point of a large transit trade through
                            Turkey to Persia. For the purpose of giving this commerce greater
                            facilities, it was in 1847, resolved to construct a road. For this
                            purpose, twelve millions of piastres were borrowed from the funds of the
                            mosque of St. Sophia. Every preparation was made, <hi rend="italic">i.
                                e.</hi>, workmen were impressed from the neighborhood, and deceived
                            daily one piece of bread and three piastres. The road was made but a
                            very short distance, as far as the foot of the mountain Boz-dagh, and
                            nothing further has been done. At this time the trade had reached its
                            highest development, and the line from Trieste to Constantinople and
                            Trebizond was considered by the Austrian Lloyds as their most lucrative
                            one. The Danube navigation company also did excellent business at that
                            time by sending steamers from Galatz to Trebizond. When the war was
                            over, the Russians saw their mistake, and changed their policy with
                            regard to the transit trade, and began improving their communications
                            through the Caucasus and across the Caspian to Persia. As these roads
                            became better and the road from Trebizond became worse (the Turks never
                            having finished the contemplated highway nor having improved the old
                            road in any respect), the Persian trade began to go through Russia. The
                            importance of Trebizond fell, consulates and consulates-general were
                            gradually reduced to vice-consulates or consular-agencies, and <pb
                                facs="0881" n="147" xml:id="pg_147"/> Persian merchants who lived at
                            Trebizond transferred their headquarters to Poti in the Caucasus. What
                            traffic was left the Turks ruined by unwise custom-house measures. The
                            duties had previously been one per cent. ad valorem, and the time
                            allowed for the transit of the goods was six months, <hi rend="italic"
                                >i. e</hi>., if they were not transported to Persia within six
                            months the duties would be raised to 8 per cent. as for importations to
                            Turkey. As on account of the state of the roads it was impossible to
                            transport goods during the winter, the merchants demanded a reform of
                            this regulation, and desired that the time during which the goods could
                            remain in bond should be increased to at least twelve months. A
                            commission was appointed in 1871 to consider the subject, and in 1873
                            changed the regulations so that to free the goods from the extra 7 per
                            cent. duty the certificate that they had been exported over the Turkish
                            frontier must be sent back to the chief custom-house at Trebizond within
                            six months, thus still further reducing the time within which the goods
                            could be held in bond. More than that, after the 1st September, 1873,
                            the transit duty was raised to 2 per cent., and in addition to this
                            another tax was imposed, under the name of “stamp-tax,” of three
                            piasters on each bale of goods. As the merchants, however, threatened to
                            send no more goods whatever by that route this tax was finally taken
                            off.</p>
                        <p>In addition to what I have just stated, the means of transportation are
                            very irregular, owing to the cost of caravans of camels. The steamers
                            too, running direct from Marseilles to Poti, carry goods at rates of
                            freight much lower than do any of the lines to Trebizond.</p>
                        <p>In 1875 the exports from Persia by the Trebizond route amounted in value
                            to about $1,375,000, and the imports into Persia to $4,470,000. Of these
                            imports $3,770,000 came from Great Britian, and $200,000 from France.
                            The amount of cotton goods sent to Persia by this route was $4,050,000,
                            of sugar $166,000, and of tea $158,000. Even the trade in sugar and tea
                            will show the possibility of American enterprise in this direction.</p>
                        <p>To show the falling off in trade at Trebizond, the total imports both for
                            Persia and Asiatic Turkey at that port fell off from $17,082,000 in 1860
                            to $6,418,000 in 1875, and the exports (for the same countries) from
                            $7,950,000 in 1860 to $2,990,000 in 1875.</p>
                        <p>The commerce of Aleppo is rapidly disappearing, partly owing to local
                            causes, the want of a bank, and consequent commercial disturbances when
                            Turkish securities began to fall, a sudden and violent outbreak of the
                            cholera which for a while paralyzed business, but chiefly owing to the
                            opening of the Suez canal, which has drawn off the trade for Bagdad and
                            Southern Persia. The imports into Alexandretta, the port of Aleppo, in
                            1874 were $6,725,000, in 1875 $4,885,000, and in 1876 $2,565,000, thus
                            showing a great falling off from the amount of $10,000,000 which they
                            reached a few years ago. The exports from Alexandretta tell the same
                            story; they were $4,400,000 in 1874, $3,830,000 in 1875, and $2,105,000
                            in 1876.</p>
                        <p>The trade of Bagdad with Persia shows a decrease in Persian exports and
                            an increase in imports from foreign countries in 1875, as compared with
                            1874. In 1874 the exports from Persia through Bagdad reached the sum of
                            $1,025,000, and in 1875 only $327,000, The imports into Persia were in
                            1874 $208,000 and in 1875 $1,152,000. This increase was chiefly in
                            wool.</p>
