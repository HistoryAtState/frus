                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the
                    series. This documentary editing proceeds in full accord with the generally
                    accepted standards of historical scholarship. Secretary of State Frank B.
                    Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26, 1925. These
                    regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993 established a new statutory charter for the preparation of the series,
                    which was signed by President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198
                    of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, <hi rend="italic">et seq</hi>.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records from all relevant departments and agencies
                    needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major foreign policy decisions
                    and actions of the United States Government. The statute also confirms the
                    editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of historical
                    objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made
                    without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume, which was compiled in
                    1995–1997, meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection
                    and editing.</p>

                <p>This volume is part of a sub series of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the

                    major foreign policy decisions and actions of President <persName
                        corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s administration. The editors of the
                    volume sought to include documentation illuminating the foreign policymaking
                    process of the U.S. Government, with emphasis on the highest level at which
                    policy on a particular subject was determined. The documents include memoranda
                    and records of discussions that set forth policy issues and show decisions or
                    actions taken as well as key recommendations and analysis from the Embassy in
                    Japan. The emphasis is on the development of U.S. policy and on major aspects
                    and repercussions of its execution rather than on the details of policy
                    execution.</p>

                <p>This volume documents U.S. policy toward Japan during a period of increasing
                    change in the relations between the two allies. Japan was fast becoming a major
                    economic power while still relying on the United States for its security. A
                    theme of the coverage, in fact, is the ongoing U.S. effort to encourage Japan to
                    assume a greater role in its own military defense and to play a greater role on
                    the world stage, especially in terms of the economic development of the rest of
                    Asia. Another major theme is U.S. efforts to encourage the continuation of a
                    moderate, pro-Western Japanese Government. The creation of a joint U.S.-Japanese
                    economic planning group sought to coordinate the two economies. The eventual
                    reversion of U.S. administered-Ryukyus to Japan was a goal of Japanese
                    Governments, but it played out during this period in the successful effort by
                    Japan to regain control in 1968 from the United States of the much less
                    strategically significant Bonin Islands. A related theme was domestic Japanese
                    opposition to the war in Vietnam and the use of U.S. bases in Japan to support
                    the U.S. campaign in Vietnam. A final theme is the successful U.S.
                    discouragement of closer Japanese-People's Republic of China relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> usually made the major
                    foreign policy decisions during his Presidency, and the editors sought to
                    document his role as far as possible. In the case of Japan, President <persName
                        corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> only became engaged in 1965 when he
                    established a close personal working relationship with Japanese Prime Minister
                        <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>. In 1967,
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                    again worked together to finalize the agreement on reversion of the Bonins. The
                    United States was represented in Japan in 1964-1968 by two strong Ambassadors,
                        <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Edwin O. Reischauer</persName> and then
                        <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName>. Their policy
                    recommendations and analysis was given great weight in Washington.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V"
                        facs="0006"/>date and time of the conversation, rather than the date the
                    memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. The editors have supplied a heading for
                    each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation
                    are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious typographical
                    errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions are corrected by
                    bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type, an addition in roman
                    type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text are printed in italics.
                    Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found, and a list of
                    abbreviations is included in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that discusses an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages that were
                    omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes have been
                    accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of pages not
                    declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material omitted from
                    this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume, however, has
                    not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text are so
                    identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and, if so, this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises,

                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation and declassification of the series. Although the Advisory
                    Committee does not attempt to review the contents of individual volumes in the
                    series, it does monitor the overall process and makes recommendations on

                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12958 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume began in 1995 and was finally completed
                    in 2005. It resulted in the decision to withhold 18 documents in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in 4 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a

                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation, annotation, and editorial notes
                    presented here provide a broadly accurate account of U.S. policy toward Japan,
                    with the understanding that some material remains classified. Additional
                    insights are provided in the memoirs of the two ambassadors serving in Japan
                    during the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration: <persName

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy
                    decisions and actions of the U.S. government. It further requires that
                    government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete
                    access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by
                    providing copies of selected records. The editor believes that in terms of
                    access this volume was prepared in accordance with the standards and mandates of
                    this statute, although access to some records was restricted, as noted
                    below.</p>
                <p>The editor had complete access to all the retired records and papers of the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special
                    decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and
                    division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat, which
                    contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
                    correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and
                    memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
                    foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts.
                    Intelligence-related files maintained by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    were fully available for use in this volume. Those files contain: minutes and
                    related records of the 303 Committee, a high-level, interagency oversight board
                    reviewing and approving intelligence operations and covert actions; the weekly
                    and monthly meeting records of the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs (later renamed
                    the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs); and intelligence records
                    pertaining to specific countries, regions, or events.</p>
                <p>The editor of this volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series
                    also had full access to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName> and other White House foreign-policy records.
                    Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential libraries
                    include some of the most significant documentation related to foreign affairs
                    from other federal agencies, including the National Security Council, the
                    Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff, the National Security Agency, and the United States Information Agency.
                    All of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of these
                    agencies and the cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>The Department of State arranged for access to the audiotapes of President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s telephone conversations
                    that are held at the <persName>Johnson</persName>
                    <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0015"/>Library. The first audiotapes became
                    available to Department of State historians in late 1994, with most of those
                    covering the later years of the <persName>Johnson</persName> Presidency
                    following in 1995 and 1996.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Secretaries of Defense and their major
                    assistants and the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The editor of this
                    volume also had access to the Papers of General Maxwell Taylor at the National
                    Defense University.</p>
                <p>Since 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided expanded access to
                    Department of State historians to high-level intelligence documents from those
                    records still in the custody of that Agency. Access is arranged by the History
                    Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency,
                    pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding. Department of State and
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians continue to work out the
                    procedural and scholarly aspects of the access, which at this time is not yet
                    unlimited or without deficiencies, and the variety of documentation made
                    available and selected for publication in the volumes has expanded. The editor
                    of this volume made particular use of the files of Deputy Director of Central
                    Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard Helms</persName>.</p>
                <p>The particular files and collections consulted and cited in this volume are as

                    certainly was a natural choice but it was assigned this function at least in
                    part because the Agency controlled unvouchered funds, by which operations could
                    be funded with minimal risk of exposure in Washington.<note n="1"

                    <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s early use of its new covert action mandate
                    dissatisfied officials at the Departments of State and Defense. The Department
                    of State, believing this role too important to be left to the <gloss

                <p>
                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 directed <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                        >CIA</gloss> to conduct “covert” rather than merely “psychological”
                    operations, defining them as all activities “which are conducted or sponsored by
                    this Government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of
                    friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and executed that any

                    managing covert actions. OPC, which was to take its guidance from the Department
                    of State in peacetime and from the military in wartime, initially had direct
                    access to the State Department and to the military without having to proceed
                    through <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s administrative hierarchy, provided

                <p>During the Korean conflict the OPC grew quickly. Wartime commitments and other

                    prominent of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s activities. Concerned about
                    this situation, DCI Walter Bedell Smith in early 1951 asked the <gloss

                    operations. The White House responded with two initiatives. In April 1951
                    President Truman created the Psychological Strategy Board (PSB) under the <gloss

                        >NSC</gloss> 10/2 and expanded <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s

                    Intelligence for the conduct of covert operations was further clarified.
                    President Eisenhower approved <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5412 on March
                    15, 1954, reaffirming the Central Intelligence Agency's responsibility for
                    conducting covert actions abroad. A definition of covert actions was set forth;
                    the DCI was made responsible for coordinating with designated representatives of

                <p>After the Bay of Pigs failure in April 1961, General Maxwell Taylor reviewed U.S.
                    paramilitary capabilities at President Kennedy's request and submitted a report
                    in June that recommended strengthening high-level direction of covert
                    operations. As a result of the Taylor Report, the Special Group, chaired by the
                    President's Special Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName

                    Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Lyman Lemnitzer, assumed greater
                    responsibility for planning and reviewing covert operations. Until 1963 the DCI
                    determined whether a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-originated project was
                    submitted to the Special Group. In 1963 the Special Group developed general but
                    informal criteria, including risk, possibility of success, potential for
                    exposure, political sensitivity, and cost (a threshold of $25,000 was adopted by
                    the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>), for determining whether covert action
                    projects were submitted to the Special Group.<note n="8"

                <p>From November 1961 to October 1962 a Special Group (Augmented), whose membership

                    responsibility for Operation Mongoose, a major covert action program aimed at
                    overthrowing the Castro regime in Cuba. When President Kennedy authorized the
                    program in November, he designated Brigadier General Edward G. Lansdale,
                    Assistant for Special Operations to the Secretary of Defense, to act as chief of
                    operations, and Lansdale coordinated the Mongoose activities among the <gloss

                <p>The Special Group and the 303 Committee approved 163 covert actions during the

                    Committee, however, estimated that of the several thousand projects undertaken
                    by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> since 1961, only 14 percent were
                    considered on a case-by-case basis by the 303 Committee and its predecessors
                    (and successors). Those not reviewed by the 303 Committee were low-risk and
                    low-cost operations. The Final Report also cited a February 1967 <gloss
                        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> memorandum that included a description of the

                    <p>In the 1958–1968 decade, the U.S. Government approved four covert programs to
                        try to influence the direction of Japanese political life. Concerned that
                        potential electoral success by leftist political forces would strengthen
                        Japanese neutralism and eventually pave the way for a leftist government in
                        Japan, the Eisenhower administration authorized the Central Intelligence
                        Agency before the May 1958 elections for the Japanese House of
                        Representatives to provide a few key pro-American and conservative
                        politicians with covert limited financial support and electoral advice. The
                        recipient Japanese candidates were told only that they were getting support
                        from American businessmen. This program of modest financial support to key
                        politicians continued during subsequent electoral campaigns into the
                        1960s.</p>
                    <p>Another U.S. covert action in Japan sought to reduce the chances that extreme
                        left-wing politicians would be elected. During 1959, the Eisenhower
                        administration authorized the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to
                        institute a covert program to try to split off the moderate wing of the
                        leftist opposition in the hope that a more pro-American and “responsible”
                        opposition party would emerge. This program's financial support was
                        limited—$75,000 for 1960—and it continued basically at that level through
                        the early 1960s. By 1964, key officials in the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                            >Lyndon Johnson</persName> administration were becoming convinced that
                        because of the increased stability in Japanese politics, covert subsidies to
                        Japanese politicians were no longer necessary. Furthermore, there was a
                        consensus that the program of subsidies was not worth the risk of exposure.
                        The subsidy program for Japanese political parties was phased out in early
                        1964. Meanwhile, a broader covert program, divided almost equally between
                        propaganda and social action and designed to encourage key elements in
                        Japanese society to reject the influence of the extreme left, continued to
                        be funded at moderate levels—$450,000 for 1964, for example—throughout the
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> administration.</p>

                        approval of the proposed Memorandum would be a valuable evidence of Japanese

                        the objective rather than the means of achieving it that is more important.
                        We should, therefore, use whatever approach appears to be the most

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean</persName>:</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that your forthcoming trip to Tokyo for the Cabinet Committee
                        Meeting presents an opportunity to raise with Japanese officials the
                        question of the level of their defense budget and the reduction or
                        offsetting of the continuing high level of our defense expenditures in
                        Japan. You will recall we discussed these matters in a meeting with
                        Ministers <persName corresp="#p_OM2">Ohira</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName> at the time of the Cabinet Meeting in
                        Washington in December 1962.<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">For a memorandum of

                    <p>In spite of the efforts which we have made over the past year, including

                            corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> to Japanese officials, increases
                        in the Japanese defense budget continue to be disappointing and considerably
                        below Japan's economic capabilities. In fact, the percentage of GNP going
                        into the Japanese defense budget is one of the lowest in the world, and is
                        even lower than Cambodia and approximately the same as Burma.</p>
                    <p>Our defense expenditures in Japan continue to be the second highest in any
                        country in the world, exceeded only by our expenditures in Germany. The
                        Defense Department's program to cut back our worldwide defense expenditures
                        will reduce somewhat our dollar outlay in Japan. However, even with
                        currently planned U.S. redeployments and other cutbacks, including the
                        cessation of our truck purchases in Japan, our defense expenditures are
                        likely to continue at a high level. Therefore, barring further and drastic
                        redeployments and cutbacks, it is essential to find a means for offsetting a
                        large percentage of these expenditures. However, in order to find a
                        meaningful offset formula, which would mean Japan purchasing military
                        equipment from the U.S., as do Germany and Italy, it will be necessary that
                        the Japanese defense budget be increased. I am not suggesting that the sole
                        objective of an increase in the Japanese defense budget be for this purpose,
                        but rather that Japan has a responsibility to provide for its own self
                        defense and in order to do so needs modern military equipment. As has been
                        proven <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0041"/>in the cases of Germany and
                        Italy, such equipment can in most cases be produced faster and at less cost
                        in the United States.</p>
                    <p>In view of the importance of these matters, both to Japan's own military
                        capability and to the continuing high level of U.S. dollar expenditures in
                        Japan, I recommend that you raise these subjects with the Japanese during
                        your visit. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BJC1">John
                            Bullitt</persName>, who will be the senior Treasury representative on
                        the U.S. delegation, will be prepared to provide any necessary backup

                            A follow-up conversation was held in Washington on February 29, when
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> met with

                            made clear, the Japanese were not prepared to extend diplomatic
                            recognition to the People's Republic of China at this time or in the
                            foreseeable future, but were interested in improving Sino-Japanese

                        could pull out of Southeast Asia and still survive, but that other Asian
                        states could not. He suggested the Japanese talk to their Asian neighbors
                        about relations with Communist China rather than worrying about what our

                            <item>We very much appreciate his suggestion that the exchange of
                                reporters between US and Mainland China might be injected into
                                discussion same subject between Tokyo and Peiping. We have been
                                trying for some years to arrange such an exchange but Peiping has
                                refused. A number of distinguished US journalists have in recent
                                past made individual approaches to <gloss target="#t_CHICOM1"
                                    >Chicom</gloss> representatives at various places but thus far
                                with no result. Whether exchange of reporters between us and Peiping
                                should be linked to similar exchange by Japan is something which Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> would have to
                                assess. It is much more probable that Peiping would agree to an
                                exchange with Japan than with us. However, if matter were discussed
                                with Peiping and they surprisingly agreed to exchange of reporters
                                with us we would not be embarrassed. I think it only fair to say
                                that since we have had an outstanding proposal on this matter for a
                                number of years with Peiping that if (as is highly unlikely) Peiping
                                should wish to say yes to us and no to Tokyo, we would find it
                                difficult to link the two together and would proceed with exchange.
                                In summary, we doubt that Peiping would agree to exchanges with us
                                and would, therefore, leave to <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1"
                                    >PriMin</gloss> judgment as to whether this should be a part of
                                his own approach. If approach is made and succeeds, there would be
                                no embarrassment.</item>

                                in about ten days time. It is entirely possible that security of
                                Southeast Asia will require all leading free world nations to <pb

                                on how to thwart aggressive moves of Hanoi and Peiping. Principal
                                disadvantage of French recognition Peiping was to give Peiping idea
                                that militancy pays dividends. I fear that détente psychology may be
                                in for a rude shock. Our policy is to continue on the track of
                                giving maximum support to the South Viet-Namese to win their own
                                battle. If this track becomes impossible then principal governments
                                will have to look at the alternatives in the most sober
                                fashion.</item>

                                central issue is what is Japan's policy toward free world interests
                                and communist expansion in Asia. It is not a question of look over a
                                shoulder at us but engages Japan's most central and vital interests
                                in security and stability in the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia.
                                I hope very much that our two governments can keep in closest

                        by the <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0047"/>appointment of a civilian High

                            informed <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> of his efforts to

                    </p>
                    <p>I privately discussed the matter on a number of occasions with <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR1">Cy Vance</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AS3"
                            >Steve Ailes</persName> against the background of the developments in
                        Panama, pointing out that we should now be looking to perhaps the next
                        twenty years in Okinawa. We had managed to get by these past eighteen years
                        under the present arrangement but I feared that the concept of an American
                        military officer ruling over an alien population of almost one million would
                        not continue to be viable with U.S., Ryukyuan, Japanese or world opinion,
                        and we should adjust our arrangements before the pressures begin to grow. In
                        view of its past record and the problem of appropriations, I dismissed the
                        possibility of seeking to give Interior responsibility for the civil aspects
                        of Okinawa. I also thought the responsibility remaining in the Department of
                        Defense was consistent with our position that the occupation of Okinawa was
                        based upon military necessity and was in principle temporary in nature.
                        However, to obtain the type of person that would be required as a civilian
                        High Commissioner (I had in mind an ex-governor, mayor of a large city or
                        some similar background), I thought it essential he be responsible directly
                        to the Secretary of Defense rather than to the Secretary of the Army.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Cy Vance</persName> was responsive to the
                        concept. Understandably, <persName corresp="#p_AS3">Steve Ailes</persName>
                        was somewhat resistant. The Secretary also discussed it directly with Bob
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> who, while not
                        rejecting it, was understandably concerned at arousing in an election year
                        some of those on the Hill, particularly in the Armed Services Committees,
                        who could be expected to be very resistant to any change. In order to move
                        the issue from one of abstract principle to concrete terms we sought quietly
                        to locate someone who might be considered for the position. However, we were
                        not successful.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we have now concurred in the appointment of General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WMGAII1">Albert Watson</persName>, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_CLGPW1">Caraway</persName>'s replacement. It had been hoped
                        and expected that Tic Bonesteel, who would of course be absolutely first
                        class, would be appointed but this turned out to be impossible because Tic
                        has been having very grave difficulties with his sight which require his
                        remaining close to the specialist in Philadelphia who has been treating him.
                        All of us who know of his work feel that <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1"
                            >Watson</persName>, who has been Commandant in Berlin, is by far the
                        best second choice. His record in Berlin was excellent and he is accustomed
                        to working very closely with State in a complicated and complex military
                        milieu. He <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0048"/>will also be briefed
                        thoroughly here on the importance of doing much better than we have in the
                        past in taking account of our problems vis-à-vis Japan with respect to the
                        Ryukyus, and I think that you will find him willing to work effectively with
                        you.</p>
                    <p>This does not mean we have abandoned the concept of the civilian High
                        Commissioner, but only that we have set it aside for the time being. In the
                        meanwhile, I feel confident that General <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1"
                            >Watson</persName> will serve to eliminate some of the problems we have
                        been facing, especially with respect to Japan.</p>
                    <p>I know that you will keep the foregoing very much to yourself, but wanted you
                        and <persName corresp="#p_EJK1">John Emmerson</persName> to have the full
                        story as it now stands.</p>

                            shape out there. He said what should be done was that General Carraway
                            should be replaced by a civilian, some ex-Democratic governor, for
                            example. The Army does not want to do this, and the State Department
                            will not fight on this issue. <persName>Bundy</persName> mentioned <pb

                            didn't like this idea, saying that would take too long. The upshot of
                            this part of the discussion was that it was evident that Okinawa would
                            soon be discussed with the President, although exactly when remains

                    <p>After some back and forth, in which generally everybody favored a civilian
                        governor for Okinawa, Forrestal said the ideal solution would be to have a
                        civilian governor with a military deputy. The civilian will report to <gloss
                            target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> (rather than the Army), and the military
                        would report through the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.

                    <p>I commented that although the military had certainly not been blameless, the
                        problem in Okinawa seemed to run deeper than just that of the military
                        nature of the government. The Okinawans wanted out from under US rule.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed, but not enthusiastically, and
                        commented that a farsighted civilian governor who thought in civilian terms
                        could do a lot to meet the needs of the Okinawans.</p>
                    <p>The matter was left with Forrestal being responsible for deciding how best to
                        handle this problem and to come up with some proposed program for moving in
                        the direction of greater civilization of Okinawa.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> recalled that he had been closely associated
                        with the Okinawan situation since 1946, when he had sent a consular officer
                        to Okinawa to handle various consular matters for U.S. forces stationed
                        there; this officer came back from Naha full of concern about various
                        problems there. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said he had been in the
                        Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs in the Department, from 1949 to 1953, when he
                        was again closely associated with Okinawan affairs. He expressed pleasure
                        that General <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1">Watson</persName> was going to
                        Okinawa, and said that he thought the task of the High Commissioner is
                        probably one of the toughest jobs the Army has for an officer.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said the United States has made out
                        amazingly well in the Ryukyus over the last 20 years. This has been partly
                        because of the placid and mild temperament of the Ryukyuan people. Over the
                        next 20 years or longer, however, he felt it possible that the Ryukyus would
                        emerge like Angola, Mozambique and other areas as a first-class colonial
                        problem. Our long-term tenure is viable only if our relations with Japan
                        vis-à-vis the Ryukyuan problem are viable. We must work hard to maintain a
                        position in Okinawa which is manageable from the standpoints of world
                        opinion and the opinions of the American people. Mr.
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> felt that on the economic side we have done
                        well in Okinawa. The standard of living and general economic well-being of
                        the Ryukyuan people appear to have shown considerable improvement over the
                        period of our administration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said the Government of Japan is conservative
                        and has shown itself willing to play ball with us on the Okinawa problem.
                        The ruling conservative elements in Japan must clearly demonstrate an
                        interest in the Ryukyus, however. We must assist the Japanese in maintaining
                        its present policy position with respect to the Okinawan problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said that in the Ryukyus we have to walk a
                        narrow line between paternalistic protection of the Ryukyuans from their own
                            <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0051"/>mistakes and a policy of autonomy
                        for the Ryukyuans. This is a hard job and there are no clear answers as to
                        how it can best be accomplished. The High Commissioner's power of veto over
                        the actions of the Government of the Ryukyu Islands tends to make the
                        Ryukyuans irresponsible, able to blame developments on the High
                        Commissioner. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said he believed the
                        Ryukyuans should be forced to assume more responsibility for their own
                        affairs, even though this meant letting them make mistakes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said that it is all too easy to sit in
                        Washington or to visit Okinawa briefly and come up with expert answers. He
                        felt, however, that we have been a little too paternalistic and protective
                        in our administration of the islands.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said that the High Commissioner is
                        confronted with the dilemma of reconciling the political desires of the
                        Ryukyuans and the Japanese with the military requirements of our mission
                        there. There appears to be some feeling of suspicion and hostility toward
                        Japan among U.S. officials in Okinawa. They seem to feel that they must
                        defend themselves against Japan's edging in. Some of these feelings appeared
                        to be transferred to the Embassy in Tokyo. He hoped that General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WMGAII1">Watson</persName> could make the relationship with
                        the Embassy and the Japanese a little less suspicious. We should aim at a
                        normal friendly give-and-take and strive for mutual confidence with the
                        Japanese. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1">Watson</persName>'s
                        consultations in Tokyo on his way to Naha would give him an excellent
                        opportunity to talk with the Embassy and to meet some of the key Japanese
                        Government officials concerned with Ryukyuan affairs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> referred to President Kennedy's policy
                        statement of March 19, 1962 and said that the primary objective of the
                        President's statement is to enable us to stay in the Ryukyus for as long as
                        there is a military requirement for our bases there.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d14fn3">On March 19, 1962, President Kennedy announced measures
                            to strengthen civil and local government in the Ryukyu Islands,
                            including enabling the legislature to nominate the Chief Executive,
                            limiting the High Commissioner's veto power, and lengthening the term of
                            the legislature. Kennedy also called for a continuous review of local
                            and military government to determine those administrative functions that
                            could be turned over to the Ryukyuan Government. On October 4 Kennedy
                            approved an increase in U.S. funding for the social and economic
                            development of the islands. (<hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
                                Current Documents, 1962</hi>, pp. 1032–1033)</note> The Department
                        of State completely supports this objective. In our administration in
                        Okinawa we must do everything possible to prevent the rise of local
                        hostility to our presence. We could not stay in Okinawa if we lose the
                        support of Japan. The guidelines of our policies in Okinawa must be the
                        attitudes of the local populace, of the Japanese, and the American people.
                        Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said General <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1"
                            >Watson</persName> had our solid and sympathetic support.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0052"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said that our problem in Okinawa is similar
                        in some ways—and fundamentally different in others—to that in Panama. There
                        is an American enclave with an American standard of life that is completely
                        different from that of the local populace. The situation is bound to create
                        problems, but they should not be unmanageable if we conduct our
                        administration intelligently. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1"
                            >Watson</persName> observed that he had heard that Okinawan attitudes
                        toward the Americans in the Ryukyus are friendly and favorable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> asked about the status of the Department of
                        the Army's appropriation bill for Okinawa and was told that the Army has
                        requested $12 million for economic assistance and $2.4 million for
                        administration. The Army estimates that it may get around $12 million total.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCJJ1">Colonel Duffy</persName> said the hearings
                        before the Passman Subcommittee were unprecedented in the warmth of the
                        committee's reception of Department of the Army spokesmen, including General
                            <persName corresp="#p_CLGPW1">Caraway</persName>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCJJ1">Colonel Duffy</persName> noted that Congressman
                        Passman visited Okinawa this spring and carried away a very fine impression
                        of the job done by General <persName corresp="#p_CLGPW1">Caraway</persName>.
                        Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> expressed pleasure that General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WMGAII1">Watson</persName> may have an adequate budget with
                        which to work.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Looking ahead over the next ten years, we can expect to find ourselves
                        dealing with an increasingly strong, confident and nationalistic Japan.
                        Pro-Western, conservative elements will probably retain control at least
                        until 1969 or 1970, possibly alternating power thereafter with socialist
                        governments of considerably more moderate hue than today's Japan Socialist
                        Party. Japanese society will increasingly resemble Western industrial
                        societies—urbanized and suburbanized, sophisticated consumer tastes,
                        apartment dwelling and gadget served. Japan's economic <pb n="17"
                            xml:id="pg_17" facs="0053"/>and security relations with the U.S. will
                        remain vitally important to it—and scarcely less so to us—but the
                        relationship will become less predominant in Japan's foreign relations and
                        more pragmatic as Japan seeks its own way in the world and attempts to
                        reduce its present extraordinary dependence on the U.S. China will remain an
                        area of potential policy difference with us, but with the odds against a
                        major split on recognition and other basic issues, partly because of the
                        broad consensus in Japan in favor of self-determination on Taiwan. As Japan
                        assumes a greater share of Free World burdens and responsibilities, it will
                        demand, and we will wish to accord it, a greater voice in East Asian and
                        world policy decisions.</p>
                    <p>There is no reason why we cannot live with these changes, and indeed benefit
                        from them. Japan may be less under our influence than now, but it will be
                        firmly anti-Communist, internally less divided, more conscious of its
                        responsibilities, and over-all a greater source of Free World strength than
                        it is today. Determined and able to stand on its own feet in pursuit of what
                        it considers its true national interests, its position will increasingly
                        resemble that of our major European Free World allies.</p>
                    <p>What the U.S. does or does not do in and with respect to Japan will remain
                        highly important to Japan's future course, and thus to our own Far Eastern
                        and world position. Events have proved the soundness of our Japan policies
                        of recent years, and there appears no present ground for believing that the
                        main elements of those policies will not retain validity over most of the
                        next decade. Programs to promote moderating trends on the left should be
                        continued as long as they are needed and effective. U.S. security guarantees
                        should be maintained as the umbrella under which Japan should be encouraged
                        steadily to expand and modernize its home defense forces and pursue other
                        domestic and foreign programs directly or indirectly contributory to Free
                        World interests. These include an enlarged and improved development
                        assistance program, trade and investment liberalization, an <gloss
                            target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> settlement, cooperative economic assistance
                        programs in the Ryukyus, and expansion and modernization of Japan's
                        neglected public services. Efforts should be made to guide Japanese energies
                        in directions adapted to Japan's national aptitudes and motivations,
                        including such projects as a revamped and generously financed foreign
                        trainee program. The possibility should not be excluded of Japan's
                        eventually, possibly within the next 10 years, assuming defense
                        responsibilities outside the immediate Japan area, beginning with
                        participation, hopefully well within the decade, in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> peace-keeping activities. Maintenance and strengthening of
                        our consultative relationship with the Japanese Government on world problems
                        of mutual concern will be of continuing importance in our efforts to keep
                        Japan closely identified with and a major contributor to Free World goals
                        and programs.</p>
                    <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0054"/>
                    <p>The prime requirement of a healthy course of developments in Japan over the
                        next decade will be an adequate rate of growth of Japan's foreign trade. A
                        trading nation, Japan stands to benefit greatly from Free World trade
                        liberalization efforts, but is hampered in its desire to participate fully
                        in reductions of trade barriers by the continued existence of a substantial
                        proportion of high-cost, protected industries, by the rigidities of the
                        Japanese wage and employment system, and by the economy's vulnerability to
                        trade fluctuations arising from its heavy dependence on trade. The problem
                        is clearly recognized in Japan, but U.S. patience, firmness and example will
                        critically influence the outcome. It is difficult to see how Japan's minimum
                        economic goals can be attained unless Japan is afforded opportunity to
                        expand its sales on the U.S. market at least in proportion with the growth
                        of the U.S. GNP— though maintenance of the high annual rate of sales
                        expansion to the U.S. of past years (26% 1953–60 and 10% 1960–62) cannot be
                        expected. This will require firm Executive Branch resistance of American
                        industry demands for curtailment of Japanese imports, except in what will
                        probably continue to be rare instances where market disruption can actually
                        be proved. It is only less important that when the U.S. must act contrary to
                        Japanese trading interests, time and effort be taken to put the best
                        possible face on the action through diplomatic and other means to minimize
                        the adverse reaction in Japan, instead of the Japanese learning of the
                        matter for the first time through Washington press announcements, as so
                        often in the past.</p>
                    <p>An attempt to predict Japanese developments ten years ahead should allow
                        sufficient of the saving element of the earthquakes and typhoons that mark
                        the natural scene. It would be rash to assume that the day of the sudden and
                        unforeseen—the 1952 May Day riots, the “Golden Dragon” fallout excitement,
                        the Girard Case, the 1960 Security Treaty turmoil—is over in Japan, or that
                        seizures of irrationality in the Japanese character are now happily matters
                        of the past. Wise U.S. policy toward Japan will reflect a capacity to
                        anticipate and move quickly to encompass the unexpected.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Southeast Asia</hi>. After the usual formalities, Mr.
                                <persName>Fukuda</persName> stated that Japan very much appreciated
                            the US efforts in Southeast Asia. He pointed out that it was difficult
                            to maintain control of such an area solely through military means. Based
                            on the Japanese experience, political, economic, social, and cultural
                            efforts are also necessary. He went on to say that the Asians have
                            developed new strong feelings of nationalism, and although the motives
                            of free nations are good, the Communists can twist these motives so that
                            they appear to be against the new and developing countries. It is
                            necessary, therefore, that Japan and the US be careful to make the
                            objects of their policies clear so as to avoid giving the Communists the
                            opportunity to make gains.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Mainland China</hi>. Mr. <persName>Fukuda</persName>
                            pointed out that despite serious harvest losses and the failure of their
                            “great leap forward,” the Chinese Communists are concentrating on the
                            domestic build-up in preference to improving their military forces.
                            Japan does not believe it is possible for the Chinese Communists to
                            mount a large build-up although their propaganda is very active in
                            telling everyone how strong China is and what its military abilities
                            are. Going back to Southeast Asia, Mr. <persName>Fukuda</persName>
                            brought out three points: 1) Japan welcomed the appointment of General
                                Taylor<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">General Maxwell Taylor was
                                appointed Ambassador to South Vietnam on July 1.</note> because it

                            of the US in Asia; 2) Japan wishes the US success in its efforts to push
                            for international cooperation, as in Korea; and 3) Chinese Communists in
                            Asia are most desirous that the US not reach a détente with the USSR, as
                            this would enable the US to concentrate its efforts on Communist
                            China.</item>

                                <hi rend="italic">Effect of Communist Gains in Asia</hi>. Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked what the
                                effect on Japan would be if a Viet Cong government took over South
                                Vietnam. Mr. <persName>Fukuda</persName> replied that it would be
                                like the chessman on a board falling over (the Domino theory), and
                                the repercussions would be felt in Thailand, Indonesia, and in other
                                countries in that area. There would be no direct effect on Japan but
                                indirectly, pressures would build up, particularly in Korea where
                                the Communist Party might be able to gain power through evidence of
                                US failures in Southeast Asia. These pressures would effect Japan.
                                Mr. <persName>Fukuda</persName> then expanded this view by saying
                                that Japan feels that <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is a
                                bonfire which is close and he personally feels Japan should do
                                everything to help the US put it out. Unfortunately, Japan's new
                                constitution and domestic attitudes inhibit actions in this
                                regard.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary asked what the effect would be on Japan if the US lost
                                in South Vietnam. Mr. <persName>Fukuda</persName> replied that this
                                would strengthen the left wing elements in Japan, who would probably
                                protest US military bases in Japan and the Japanese-US Mutual
                                Security Treaty. Secondly, Japan would lose trading opportunities in
                                    <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. The Secretary asked if this
                                would lead to pressures for increased trade between Japan and
                                Communist China. Mr. <persName>Fukuda</persName> replied that the
                                Japanese believe that trade with Communist China has been given too
                                much propaganda. Looking at China's trading capability, one could
                                see that the Chinese Communists are very limited in products and
                                foreign exchange reserves.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Japanese Constitution</hi>. The Secretary brought
                            up Article IX of the Japanese Constitution and its influence on the
                            military forces of Japan. Mr. <persName>Fukuda</persName> answered that
                            this article was the result of original US policy of making Japan weak
                            militarily. After the Korean War, a change in US policy resulted and the
                            US assisted Japan in developing military forces. In spite of the limits
                            of Article IX, Japan has made three successive steps towards developing
                            armed forces; first, a national police force, then a Security Reserve,
                            and now Self Defense Forces. In substance, Japan has been acting as
                            though the Article has been changed but an actual legislative change
                            would be difficult. He noted, however, that public opinion shows
                            increasing support for a legislative change and Article IX is under
                            study by a special investigating committee. <persName>Fukuda</persName>
                            said the feeling is that the Article will be changed, but it will not be
                            as strong as he would like. Japan's political process requires a
                            two-thirds majority in both Houses followed by a popular
                            referendum.</item>

                                <hi rend="italic">Japan Defense Budget</hi>. The Secretary suggested
                                that the Defense budget should be increased in the interests of
                                Japan. Mr. <persName>Fukuda</persName> agreed, and stated that there
                                has been an increase over the years and that increases will
                                continue. An amendment to Article IX of the Constitution would
                                increase popular support for a larger defense budget.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary pointed out that some countries must be careful not to
                                devote too much of their GNP to defense as India is doing, as Iran
                                once did and perhaps as South Korea is tending to do. However, Japan
                                is the reverse in its defense spending. He was delighted to hear Mr.
                                    <persName>Fukuda</persName> express an interest in increasing
                                the budget since Japan, as an economically strong and viable
                                country, has relatively small defense expenditures in comparison
                                with the other free world countries.</p>

                                    <persName>Fukuda</persName> said that Japan understands the need
                                for the US to decrease <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, and
                                Japan must begin to develop an industrial and technical ability to
                                manufacture and develop its own defense needs. To do this Japan is
                                interested in developing closer relations with American industry by
                                way of cooperative logistics efforts. For example, Japan has been in
                                contact with Raytheon on co-production of HAWK.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary replied that the US would be pleased to provide
                                assistance on co-production and any other assistance that might be
                                needed to develop Japan's defense production capabilities. Mr.
                                    <persName>Fukuda</persName> stated that there are some items
                                such as ASROC and DASH which Japan wishes to purchase from the US
                                rather than co-produce.</p>

                            Secretary to visit Japan. The Secretary replied that he would like to
                            revive pleasant memories of his last visit and hoped that he could make
                            such a trip during the coming year. Mr. <persName>Fukuda</persName> said
                            that the Secretary's visit could be in connection with the Economic
                            Ministers meeting possibly at the same time as an Economic Ministers
                            meeting. The Secretary asked if such a visit should coincide with the
                            Economic Ministers meeting. Mr. <persName>Fukuda</persName> stated that
                            he would like to study this question and make a proposal later.</item>

                                <persName>Fukuda</persName> advanced two proposals on Okinawa and
                            the Bonins, which he was presenting at the request of the Prime
                            Minister. He said that the Japanese Government understands the need for
                            strong US military bases, such as Okinawa, but that an understanding of
                            the people of Okinawa for the need of such US bases is also necessary.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would like to review with the US
                            the matter of creating better feeling in the area. Mr. <persName

                            Bonins, Mr. <persName>Fukuda</persName> indicated the Soviets permit the
                            Japanese to visit the Kuriles gravesites as do the Chinese Communists in
                            their controlled territories. He then inquired whether the US would
                            consider such visits to the Bonins possible. The Secretary replied that
                            it could be considered through the US Embassy in Tokyo.</item>

                            concessions regarding trans-Pacific travel. At the same time, the
                            Department believed U.S. carriers could acquire additional benefits from
                            Japan, if Japanese desires were met, and therefore the U.S. Government
                            should promote the interests of the U.S. airlines by negotiating an
                            aviation agreement. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG

                                >Harriman</persName> memorandum of July 9. The talks had already
                            been in recess since July 7, and <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> advocated resuming the negotiations, granting Japan
                            access to New York by way of the Pacific, and asking for additional
                            benefits for U.S. carriers in exchange for that concession. (Ibid.)

                        are apt to change between now and the end of the year unless Japan resorts
                        to retaliation by harassment, or even threat to abrogate. My recommendation
                        is based upon a belief that a reasonable counter-offer will demonstrate good
                        faith, forestall retaliation, and cushion the shock which would be produced
                        on U.S.-Japanese relations were the Japanese Delegation to return home
                        completely empty-handed.</p>
                    <p>To have denied Japan the exception we gave Canada under the proposed interest
                        equalization tax rankles deeply and, over the coming six months, we are
                        likely to disappoint Japanese expectations on a number of matters. We will
                        have difficulty in meeting even minimum Japanese expectations: (1) from the
                        king crab negotiations; (2) in achieving success from a promised
                        Administration effort to reverse the Saylor amendment; (3) for satisfactory
                        clarification of the Treasury antidumping action on Japanese steel pipe; and
                        (4) of Administration softening of “ship American” policies.</p>

                            n="4" xml:id="d18fn4">In telegram 253 from Tokyo, July 20, <persName
                                corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> noted that “Japan feels
                            genuinely the ’aggrieved partner‘” in the aviation issue because access

                            service, had been granted to other countries by the United States. That
                            message was echoed in telegram 280 from Tokyo, July 22, containing
                            remarks made to <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> by
                            Japanese Transportation Minister Matsuura. Matsuura also pointed out the
                            one-sided nature of the aviation agreement currently in effect and noted
                            that Japan had in the past granted U.S. carriers special rights and
                            privileges granted to no other country. (Ibid.)</note> We face, I fear,
                        a situation in which, if talks are recessed, <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25"

                        future of United States-Japanese relations will very likely reflect
                        government opinion as well. Moreover, were the Japanese Government to try to
                        suppress anti-American overtones of that speculation, it could endanger the
                        position of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>
                        himself, strengthen public demand for exchange of trade missions with
                        Peking, and weaken Japan's present resolution to collaborate with the United
                        States in such areas as South Viet-Nam, Indonesia-Malaysia. We can consider
                        Japan's economic triumphs to be a success of United States policy, but the
                        charge that our aviation policy reflects persistence of a United States
                        “occupation mentality” reveals the delicacy of our political relationship
                        with consequences which could vitally affect our strategic position at
                        Okinawa and elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>Our official reports are pretty subdued because we felt a strongly

                        fully effective relationship between him and me and our respective staffs.
                        He appears to be as eager as I am to establish the same sort of close
                        relationship that the Embassy has with United States Forces Japan, and while
                        geography and other factors will make this somewhat more difficult in the
                        case of Tokyo-Naha contacts, I feel confident that we can greatly improve

                        made it clear to them that he would operate on the basis and in the spirit
                        of President Kennedy's March 1962 statement; that he wanted closer contacts
                        and cooperation with the Japanese Government through the new
                            committees,<note n="5" xml:id="d20fn5">Reference is to the U.S.-Japan

                        cooperate closely with the Liaison Office in Naha (this was particularly
                        reassuring to them). He did not make as specific statements on the economic
                        side, but he seemed receptive to what we said about economic problems and
                        indicated to the Japanese in general terms his desire for as much economic
                        aid and cooperation as possible. He also made clear his intention to listen
                        to the Ryukyuans and their leaders and, while he avoided using the word
                        “autonomy” to the Japanese (it does not appear in President Kennedy's
                        statement either), he did emphasize the development of “responsible
                        government” in the Ryukyus, and this was well received in Japan. He assured
                        me that he hoped to see a virtually autonomous Ryukyuan government as soon
                        as possible and that he meant to get out of the day-to-day handling of Civil
                        Affairs and to pass these duties to the Civil Administrator, as was

                    <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0066"/>
                    <p>While tension, which reached peak in last few days CivAir negotiations, has
                        subsided somewhat and consideration of this and other touchy problems
                        largely postponed until autumn or later, a sour taste has been left in
                        Japanese mouths and we can be sure that tensions will again arise. We
                        believe this period of comparative quiet should be used to resurvey the
                        totality of our relationship with Japan and identify relative importance to
                        us of various actions we want Japan to take.</p>
                    <p>We fear that certain US stands and actions may serve to nullify other
                        important stands and actions. For example, if US pressure on wool
                        negotiations brings reactions which lessen Japanese support in Vietnam,
                        without increasing Japanese willingness to cooperate on wool, we have made
                        bad bargain indeed. We cannot hope to be successful simultaneously on all
                        fronts in pushing Japanese in directions in which we wish them to go, and
                        some of these directions sometimes seem to cancel each other out. Unless we
                        show consistency in what we ask of Japan, and prove ourselves willing to
                        give as much attention to important Japanese interests as we expect them to
                        give ours, we are likely to have increasing difficulty in getting the
                        Japanese to do what we wish in most vital areas.</p>
                    <p>We must also bear in mind that gradual growth of defense consciousness in
                        Japan and willingness consider larger role in Asian affairs is inevitably
                        being accompanied by revival of some degree of Japanese nationalism. Thus
                        far this nationalism has been favorable to US and consistent with our broad
                        common interests, and there is no inherent reason why it should not continue
                        so. It is essential, however, to recognize that irritations aroused by
                        international economic issues could help deflect this nationalism into less
                        desirable channels.</p>

                        reduce our leverage on other issues. In both instances Japanese allege
                        current relationships are governed by unequal <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31"

                        our profession of equal partnership. In both cases concepts of national
                        pride and “international equality” loom large for Japanese. <gloss

                        Convention which will provide more advantageous basis for fishery
                        conversations Japan must have with USSR. We must expect Japan to persist in
                        its efforts on these issues and Japanese domestic political interest in them
                        to build up rather than decrease. Convention problem is, of course, closely
                        allied in Japanese minds to forthcoming talks on king crab fishery and
                        Bartlett bill.</p>
                    <p>Wool issue is one on which we should be under no illusions. Japanese will say
                        they are hearing several American voices, one advocating ideals of a
                        successful Kennedy Round and others totally inconsistent with such
                        objectives. To say that convening of wool conference will enhance our
                        ability to resist pressure for a long exceptions list will be seen by the
                        Japanese as introducing dubious criteria governing the preparation of those
                        lists. Fact that our multilateral approach on wool is result of domestic
                        pressures for unilateral action underscores persistent Japanese belief that
                        US is shifting to protectionist tack in commercial policy. They wonder if
                        after meat and wool will shoes be next? Saylor amendment despite
                        administration efforts to defeat it is already adversely affecting Japanese
                        attitudes. Additionally, we are encouraging Japan to recognize and accept
                        the necessity of a shift of labor intensive industries to <gloss
                            target="#t_LDCs1">LDC</gloss>s such as Korea, and have held to this
                        general principle for the developed countries during the recent UNCTAD.
                        Japanese will now draw conclusion that we find the same medicine distasteful
                        to ourselves. To draw attention to the threat of expanded wool textile
                        production in the <gloss target="#t_LDCs1">LDC</gloss>s to the markets in
                        the DCs will be seen by the Japanese as inconsistent with what we were
                        trying to achieve in the UNCTAD, and also in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>. We can counter these arguments to our own satisfaction,
                        but we are not likely to be persuasive with Japanese.</p>
                    <p>In our estimation, Japanese likely take less seriously our requests for
                        international cooperation in trade, aid, and close community of political
                        interests among free world countries to the extent we appear to them to
                        violate these principles ourselves. As a result of the various, and to the
                        Japanese contradictory, approaches on issues cited, Japanese may draw
                        conclusion that, while they, too, should continue to support in principle a
                        community of interest among free world nations, their major objective must
                        remain that of holding to positions which protect immediate and narrow
                        national interests.</p>
                    <p>We do not suggest that US should unnecessarily sacrifice special objectives,
                        as in aviation negotiations, fisheries or wool, but we do feel realistic
                        look must be given to difficulties of meeting these objectives fully <pb
                            n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0068"/>without endangering more important
                        ones. There is, of course, no direct one-for-one relationship between any of
                        issues on which Japanese are pressing us and any of issues on which we are
                        pressing them. However, frictions engendered over such issues as air
                        negotiations unquestionably create both public and government moods that
                        make it harder to achieve our other objectives and even cast pall over
                        warmth of developing partnership with Japan.</p>
                    <p>When viewed from vantage point of Tokyo it seems clear that these various
                        issues, though not necessarily logically related, are related in Japanese
                        mind and therefore affect one another. We believe US runs risk of
                        endangering some major objectives in relationship with Japan by overly rigid
                        stands on certain less crucial objectives. It therefore seems to us the time
                        has come for careful revaluation of US position on growing number of special
                        issues in light of their effect on broader US objectives, both economic and
                        political.</p>

                            temporarily quiescent but can easily become enflamed. The political

                        <item>The prime causes of our general inaction since March 1962 have been
                            two-fold: first, the personality and outlook of the outgoing High

                            who left office in early August; second, and more fundamentally, a

                            difficulties that have arisen through developing good relations with

                            Tokyo, with appropriate Japanese officials, and with the Okinawan
                            leadership. This may prove to be a vain hope, but the first indications
                            are promising, and State is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt
                            for the next few months.</item>

                        <item>The more basic difference between State and Defense is, however, more
                            difficult to bridge. In essence, State accepts the concept of indefinite
                            American occupation of the Ryukyus but recognizes that the political
                            cost of such occupation in terms of relations with Japan may at some
                            point face us with a hard choice between our military bases on Okinawa
                            and our strategic alliance with Japan. State therefore believes that our
                            military interests will be best served by continued motion towards
                            meeting Japanese and Okinawan demands that do not impair our security

                        <item>On the other hand, Defense appears to regard the March 1962 statement
                            as primarily a public relations gesture rather than a statement of

                            should involve continued pressure on the new High Commissioner to
                            establish good relations with the Okinawan Liberal Democratic party (now
                            dangerously torn by factionalism), with Amembassy Tokyo, and with
                            appropriate Japanese officials. We should also move to appoint a strong
                            Civil Administration to succeed the present FSO interim appointee in
                            order to rectify the imbalance between civil and military rule.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>In addition, there are a number of specific items on which we should
                            be able to move without damage to our security interests. For instance,
                            among the present slogans of “autonomy” are demands for popular election
                            of the island's Chief Executive and for Diet representation for the
                            Ryukyus on an observer basis in Tokyo. This latter item seems to me
                            reasonably justifiable in terms of our recognition of residual Japanese
                                sovereignty.<note n="6" xml:id="d23fn6">In early February, the
                                Embassy and the Department of State considered the issue of residual
                                seats for the Ryukyus in the Japanese Diet. On February 10 the
                                Department notified <persName corresp="#p_REO1"
                                    >Reischauer</persName> of its acceptance of his proposals to
                                discourage adoption of the policy. The Ambassador was also
                                instructed not to oppose the matter so strongly as to increase
                                sentiment for reversion of the Ryukyus to Japan or seriously to
                                weaken <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>'s political
                                position. If legislation could not be avoided, the Department
                                indicated it was to “include provision that if residual seats
                                established they would be filled only after full sovereignty in
                                Ryukyus returns to Japan.” (Telegram 2336 from Tokyo, February 5,
                                and Telegram 2065 to Tokyo, February 10; ibid., <gloss

                            would be actions by the High Commissioner to expedite travel to and from
                            the islands by Japanese, and to permit greater access to the Okinawan
                            economy by Japanese businessmen. (The ACLU drew up a list of similar
                            conciliatory moves last January.)</item>

                    <p>The first Japanese-United States Policy Planning Consultation meeting took
                        place in Washington from September 21–24, 1964. The meeting was attended by

                        initiated what would become a continuing series of consultative meetings
                        occurring approximately every 6 months, with the site alternating between
                        the United States and Japan. The objectives of the meetings were to
                        encourage an informal exchange of views on pertinent issues not necessarily
                        reflective of current policy, as well as to improve communications and to
                        identify issues of importance requiring future action. The United States
                        also intended the meetings to serve as a vehicle through <pb n="37"

                    <p>1. The Japanese Minister of Finance, <persName corresp="#p_TK2"
                            >Tanaka</persName>, presented the Japanese case for exemption from the
                        interest equalization tax in such a way as to indicate that the problem is
                        more political than economic. As a result, <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"

                                >McGeorge Bundy</persName> expressed President Kennedy's desire “to

                            by the Japanese Government. The President [Kennedy] recognizes the
                            Japanese Government already cedes this and that the issue cannot be
                            completely shelved, but he has other plans in connection with Japan
                            which make it important that no visit be scheduled without his
                            approval.” (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National Security
                            File, Country File, Japan, Vol. II)</note> indicated that you wished to
                        review and approve any visit of a nuclear-powered submarine to Japan before
                        such visit is definitely scheduled.<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3">The
                            requirement was rescinded in March 1967, since the special purposes
                            requiring Presidential approval no longer existed. Initially, White
                            House review was necessitated by President Kennedy's intention to visit
                            Japan. Even though those circumstances were superceded by events, the
                            requirement for Presidential approval was applied because of anticipated
                            tensions surrounding <gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss> presence in
                            Japanese ports. Since their appearance had become commonplace by early
                            1967, it was agreed that Presidential review and approval were no longer
                            required. (Memorandum to <persName>Rostow</persName> and memorandum to

                        completed satisfactory general arrangements with the Japanese Government for

                        recommended that the first such visit occur November 10–12, 1964 (with
                        November 16–18, 1964, as an alternate schedule). These dates are consistent
                        with the expressed views of the Japanese Government as to scheduling, and
                        with the operational availability of a vessel for the visit. After November
                        18, 1964, operational commitments would preclude a visit until January 12,
                        1965. In view of the extensive preparation of its public by the Japanese
                        Government, we favor the proposed November schedule lest any delay be
                        interpreted as success for Japanese political elements opposing the
                        Government's decision to permit <gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss>

                                    combination, U.S.-Japanese aid was intended to raise
                                    significantly the low standard of living on the Ryukyus, a fact
                                    that rankled Islanders and Japanese alike. (Letter to

                                    JAPAN–US) As a result of negotiations later in the year, the
                                    U.S.-Japan Consultative Committee approved a Japanese
                                    economic-assistance program for the Islands in the amount of
                                    $7.96 million. The Embassy noted that the cooperative attitude
                                    of the U.S. Civil Administration for the Ryukyus toward the
                                    Japanese economic aid package “was interpreted by the Japanese
                                    as clear proof of the United States' willingness to cooperate
                                    with Japan concerning the Ryukyus.” The Embassy also believed
                                    that the “attitude assisted materially in securing continued
                                    Japanese acquiescence in our administration of the Ryukyu

                    <p>The accumulation of a number of irritating problems between the U.S. and
                        Japan has had an abrasive effect on the fundamentally sound <pb n="42"
                            xml:id="pg_42" facs="0078"/>and mutually beneficial relations between
                        our two countries. U.S. actions and attitudes in certain areas of special
                        interest to Japan have raised doubts in the minds of many Japanese as to the
                        true value which the U.S. places on its partnership with Japan, and,
                        therefore, as to actual U.S. intentions toward Japan. It may be said that
                        our good relations with Japan, which have been carefully developed over the
                        past 19 years, are being eroded by a series of pin pricks.</p>
                    <p>Over the past few years we have quite properly stepped up pressures on Japan
                        to increase significantly its assumption of international responsibilities.
                        We are pressing Japan a) to expand its military establishment while we
                        drastically curtail grant military aid and reduce U.S. forces in Japan; b)
                        to purchase more military equipment from the U.S.; c) to cooperate in the
                        maintenance of our position in the Ryukyus; d) to increase aid to the <gloss
                            target="#t_LDCs1">LDC</gloss>s generally; e) to give special assistance
                        to South Viet-Nam, Laos and Cyprus; f) to cooperate in the economic denial
                        policies against Cuba and Communist China; g) to participate fully in the
                        Kennedy Round; h) to accelerate liberalization of the remaining import
                        restrictions and of direct foreign investment; i) to take a flexible and
                        generous position on the political and economic issues involved in Japan's
                        negotiations of over-all settlement with the Republic of Korea. These are
                        all actions of great importance to the U.S. and the Free World generally.
                        From the Japanese viewpoint, however, they are not easily taken since they
                        involve the allocation of important resources to projects which are not
                        especially popular in Japan.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, however, we have been unable to accommodate the Japanese in
                        a number of areas of special interest to them. We turned down their request
                        for a civil air route to and beyond New York. After three negotiating rounds
                        extending over a 15 month period we have not yet reached agreement on the
                        Japanese proposal for a new convention on the North Pacific Fisheries. (The
                        Japanese regard both the Civil Air Agreement and the North Pacific Fisheries
                        Convention as “unequal” agreements imposed during or after the Occupation.)
                        We granted an exemption from the Interest Equalization Tax to Canada— but
                        not to Japan. One year after our unprecedented request to audit a Japanese
                        company's books in the welded steel pipe anti-dumping case and the Japanese
                        Government's equally unprecedented acceptance of our request, we have not
                        disposed of the case; meanwhile, however, we have favorably disposed of a
                        number of more recent European pipe cases. We enacted the Saylor Amendment
                        which applies a 100 percent “Buy America” policy to the Urban Mass
                        Transportation Act. We enacted the Bartlett Act, which threatens to
                        eliminate the Japanese long-standing king crab fishery from the Eastern
                        Bering Sea, an area which the Japanese consider to be high seas. We have
                        pressed for an international meeting to consider an agreement on wool
                        textile exports. (A <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0079"/>summary of the
                        nature and status of certain current problems with Japan is attached as Tab

                            investigation into Japanese steel pipe, consultations regarding king
                            crab, and North Pacific fisheries negotiations.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The fact that many of our approaches to the Japanese in the trade field (e.g.
                        wool) stem from domestic pressures for unilateral action underscores the
                        growing Japanese belief that the U.S. is shifting to a protectionist trade
                        policy. They believe that we think first of our Atlantic partners in
                        considering problems or actions which are at least as important to Japan as
                        to the Atlantic nations. The abrasive effect of these issues stems primarily
                        from their very accumulation and from the fact that each U.S. action seems
                        to be taken in isolation without regard for its consistency with our other
                        important requests or for the over-all partnership relationship between the
                        two countries. As Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>

                        September, many Japanese believe that Japan's active cooperation with the
                        U.S. on many important matters has not been reciprocated and they are
                        asking, “How has the U.S. cooperated with Japan?” (Tab B).<note n="3"

                        that we should evaluate specific issues to determine the actions which we

                        on Japanese public psychology we believe that certain encouraging tentative

                            visit just now completed could be seen as not such a bad thing.” He also
                            pointed out that press coverage had been generally positive, and the
                            media had urged that demonstrations remain orderly.
                                <persName>Takeuchi</persName> believed the visit had the positive
                            result of raising public awareness of nuclear issues and, perhaps,
                            opening a debate on Japan's national interests and security issues.
                            (Memorandum of conversation; ibid., DEF 7 JAPAN–US)</note> Despite
                        strong, even frantic efforts of the <gloss target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_JCP1">JCP</gloss>, Sohyo, Zengakuren, and other
                        protest groups, Japanese public simply refused to support such action.
                        Opposition confidence in “nuclear-phobia” as sure-fire issue has proved
                        unwarranted in this instance. Possibly left's long-standing belief in
                        political value of demonstrations in streets has been seriously weakened by
                        the obvious fizzling their efforts this time.</p>
                    <p>This is not to say that there does not exist among large segments Japanese
                        public a basic or latent resentment against call of <hi rend="italic">Sea
                            Dragon</hi>. In this connection, should be noted that comment in major
                        newspapers continues cool at best to idea of <gloss target="#t_SSN1"
                            >SSN</gloss> visit. This in part reflects political predilections of
                        large part of newspaper staffs, but it also appears reflect feeling, clearly
                        implicit in several articles and in comments of DSPG Diet members, that
                        either U.S. not telling truth about reasons for port calls as set forth
                        aide-mémoire given <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> or alternatively U.S.
                        unreasonably risking trouble and public unrest in Japan by sending subs here
                        for trivial causes. Nevertheless, complete failure of opposition attempts
                        mount massive protest demonstrations and rallies throughout Japan against
                        calls <gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss>s while <hi rend="italic">Sea
                            Dragon</hi> was moored Sasebo marks welcome turning point in Japanese
                        public thinking, indicative of considerably more progress toward public
                        acceptance of “things nuclear” than heretofore had generally been expected.
                        It is probable that this reflects in large degree U.S./<gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> success in securing public acceptance idea
                        that <gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss> nuclear propulsion falls within
                        category of “peaceful” (i.e. non-weapons) use of nuclear power, but this of
                        itself cannot be interpreted at this time as reflecting any greater
                        willingness on part Japanese public accept nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>There remains, of course, the problem of a first call at the port of Yokosuka
                        with its closer proximity to large population concentrations. We would not,
                        of course, want proceed with scheduling of next <gloss target="#t_SSN1"
                            >SSN</gloss> call at either Yokosuka, or Sasebo, until after both <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> and ourselves have had opportunity to fully
                        assess and study where we now stand as result <hi rend="italic">Sea

                            >GOJ</gloss> and work out general timing with them. At same time we see
                        very little possibility of opposition success in mounting meaningful
                        expressions of protest <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0082"/>in connection
                        with visit to Yokosuka which we feel is further bridge we should cross near
                        future. In the interim, we can expect further public debate on <gloss
                            target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss> issue, with <gloss target="#t_JSP1"
                            >JSP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JCP1">JCP</gloss> doing their best
                        embarrass <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> on issue when
                        extraordinary Diet session reconvened later this month. But here again we
                        feel that general lack public support for attitude and tactics these
                        opposition elements, as demonstrated prior to and during call <hi
                            rend="italic">Sea Dragon</hi>, will cause this issue collapse in Diet,
                        and that Japanese people will move along rather quickly toward routine
                        acceptance of future calls by nuclear powered submarines.</p>
                    <p>One related issue will bear watching. Controversy over whether <gloss

                        attention focused on armament of <gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss>s
                        visiting Japan in future, and perhaps increase their interest in armament of
                        other U.S. Navy ships.<note n="5" xml:id="d34fn5">The Departments of State
                            and Defense instructed the Embassy that responses to media questions

                        power center in Asia acting in concert with U.S. and Free World objectives.
                        In the main, Japan is developing in this direction at the present time. U.S.
                        policies which tend to promote this development may, therefore, be said to
                        be meeting with success as of this date, although it is important to note
                        that the principal factors contributing to the evolution of Japan as a major
                        power center in Asia, and determining Japan's role in international affairs,
                        are internal Japanese developments which, however great our economic and
                        political influence, are not primarily determined by American policy.</p>
                    <p>It must also be realized that the two parts of our long-term goal are not
                        necessarily complementary in all regards, and that each must be treated in
                        its own right. Japan has become potentially a major power center, but it is
                        only slowly beginning to exercise its potential powers in international
                        affairs. As it increasingly does so, judging international affairs purely in
                        terms of the interests of Japan as seen by the Japanese, a greater
                        divergence could arise between Japanese and U.S. objectives. As of the
                        present this does not seem to be happening. However, the first emphasis in
                        U.S. policy toward Japan should be on seeking to keep Japan's international
                        objectives and actions in harmony with U.S. and Free World interests.</p>
                    <p>The continuation in power in Japan of a moderate, Western-oriented government
                        is an objective of American policy. This objective is being met. The new
                        government of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                        shows every indication, by predilection and by objective actions, of
                        moderation in internal and external affairs and of a strong orientation
                        towards the West. This is a reflection of public opinion in Japan and of the
                        multitudinous ties which bind Japan to the advanced, industrialized and
                        democratic nations of the West.</p>
                    <p>Security considerations underlie a paramount objective of American policy
                        towards Japan. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d35fn4">The text of the treaty is published in 11 <gloss
                                target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> 1632.</note> provides us with a
                        valuable base in Japan, which not only helps maintain the security of Japan
                        itself but affords logistic and back-up support to our military efforts in
                        Korea, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. Our bases in Japan are secure, and in the
                        recent Tonkin Gulf emergency it was possible to deploy forces from Japan
                        rapidly to the scene of action. Our decision to notify the Japanese
                        Government, as a matter of courtesy, of these developments in no way
                        restricted our freedom <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0084"/>of action. The
                        recent first visit to a Japanese port of a nuclear-powered submarine seems
                        to have been a forward step in increasing the freedom with which we can use
                        our bases in Japan and helped make the Japanese public think more
                        realistically about the problem of defense. A corollary to our base policy
                        is our desire to see a stronger Japanese defense establishment which would
                        assume a greater responsibility for the defense of Japan and thereby
                        contribute to the overall security of the Far East. The Japanese
                        Self-Defense Forces continue only slow progress in their respectable but
                        still minor role in defense. Thus, while our policy on general security
                        matters is meeting with current success, there are aspects which require
                        careful long-term planning.</p>
                    <p>Certain developments in the defense field will require new and careful
                        consideration. U.S. combat forces assigned to Japan under the Security
                        Treaty have been greatly reduced in the past several years. There are now no
                        ground combat units, and the major naval unit in the area, the 7th Fleet, is
                        technically not based in Japan, although its ships make heavy use of
                        Japanese ports and facilities. There have been reductions in the combat air
                        units in Japan, and further reductions are planned for next year. The forces
                        maintained by the United States in Japan are, therefore, becoming less and
                        less credible as capable of achieving their basic purpose of defending
                        against an attack on Japan. As a consequence, the role of our bases in Japan
                        in providing military support for actions in other areas, and in
                        intelligence collection and other regional activities not directly related
                        to the defense of Japan, has become proportionately greater. While
                        intelligence and other such units generally stay out of the public eye and
                        cause less [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] day-to-day problems than do combat
                        units, their presence will also become increasingly difficult to justify to
                        the Japanese public as their proportionate role becomes greater. Future
                        policy decisions on the addition or subtraction of units stationed in Japan
                        should take into account this fundamental need to justify the presence of
                        our forces here in terms of the Security Treaty and common defense.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese will obtain the right to terminate or require renegotiation of
                        the Security Treaty on one year's notice in 1970, and we must be prepared
                        for them to view the Security Treaty at that time in terms of their own
                        interpretation of their interests, rather than, as has perhaps been more the
                        case in the past, in terms of complying with the desires of the United
                        States. The Japanese interpretation will take into account probable
                        possession by Communist China of nuclear bombs and a delivery capability. We
                        must, therefore, be very watchful of any tendencies in Japan to doubt the
                        firmness of U.S. defense commitments or the <hi rend="italic">value</hi> of
                        our nuclear deterrent in defense of Free World positions in Asia and in
                        particular Japan. In this regard we must be alert to any weakening of
                        Japan's current position and stance in the face of <gloss

                    <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0085"/>
                    <p>A corollary of our defense policy towards Japan is the policy under which we
                        administer the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands. While the present policy was
                        enunciated by President Kennedy in 1962 and has remained unchanged since
                        that time, implementation of the policy has varied considerably. The present
                        administration of the policy accords well with our desire to obtain
                        continued Japanese acquiescence in our control of these Islands. Actions
                        taken during the past several months have made the image of our
                        administration of the Ryukyus considerably more favorable, but serious
                        problems still exist which are reflected in the attitude of the Japanese
                        people and Government towards our continued occupation of the Islands. The
                        important thing at this time is to continue affirmatively to carry out the
                        spirit as well as the letter of the current policy and to study long-term
                        prospects with a view to avoiding crises which would undermine the value of
                        our bases in the Ryukyus or endanger U.S.-Japan relations. We must recognize
                        that over the long run, and possibly sooner than is generally realized,
                        Japan will press for reversion of administrative rights over the Ryukyus and
                        the Bonins.</p>
                    <p>In the political field, the United States' policy is particularly concerned
                        with Japanese relations with China and Korea. We have endeavored in the
                        fourteen years since Japan resumed independence to persuade Japan of the
                        rectitude of American policy on China and to obtain the greatest possible
                        cooperation from Japan in that policy. Japan's recognition of the Republic
                        of China in Taiwan continues to be of great assistance to United States
                        policy in the Far East. Relations between Tokyo and Taipei have improved
                        since the serious differences which arose earlier this year.<note n="5"

                        in Taiwan and willingness to support a Taiwan free from Chinese Communist
                        control do not mean, however, that Japan subscribes to the view that the
                        Nationalist Government is entitled to speak for all of China. While we have
                        tried to minimize Japanese private dealings with Communist China, we have
                        had only limited success. This is because, despite the cautious attitude of
                        the government leadership—with its one eye cocked toward the United States
                        and Taiwan—the public has moved perceptively closer to the view that Japan's
                        relationship with Mainland China is too abnormal to be sustained. Under
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>'s guidance (and probably
                        also now under <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>) such public
                        views, which are also widely held within the governing party, were not
                        confronted directly but were instead <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0086"
                        />deflected towards increased trade and other contacts relating to cultural
                        kinship and tradition. Thus, although the Japanese Government continues to
                        support our policy on the seating of China in the United Nations, it seems
                        probable that, if a majority of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        members should vote to admit the Chinese Communists, and particularly if the
                        Chinese Communists should actually gain admission by either obtaining a
                        two-third majority or by upsetting the “important question” rule, the
                        Japanese Government would move towards recognizing Communist China. Even in
                        this event, however, the Japanese would probably agree with us on the
                        importance of maintaining the integrity of Taiwan. There is a continual
                        necessity for the United States to consult with Japan in advance on matters
                        concerning China.</p>
                    <p>Support for the independence of the Republic of Korea and assistance in
                        developing the Korean economy has been an important American policy in the
                        Far East. Japan has, as a matter of principle, supported this policy. The
                        lack of a settlement between Japan and the Republic of Korea, however, and
                        the tedious and often disappointing negotiations which have been conducted
                        over the years have made the Japanese Government and people skeptical about
                        the possibility of establishing normal relations with Korea.<note n="6"

                        must be prepared to do what it can to bring about that agreement and assure
                        its proper limitations.</p>
                    <p>Our economic policies have exerted a strong and healthy influence in pursuit
                        of basic goals. Japan's economic vigor, which gives added strength to its
                        democratic institutions, has developed in partnership with the United
                        States. Japan's moves toward a liberal and outward-looking stance illustrate
                        that Japan wants, and indeed Japan's prosperity and well being are dependent
                        on, the kind of inter-dependent economic world we want. Japanese and United
                        States economic policies and interests have accordingly a general harmony
                        under the principles of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, and in
                        the operating machinery of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>; we
                        have common views on means of facilitating world commerce, international
                        financial stability, and share the problem of how to deal with the economic
                        needs of the Less Developed Countries.</p>
                    <p>There are discordant notes, however, both within and outside of our bilateral
                        economic relationship, and, with the growth of Japan's power, our direct
                        leverage on troublesome issues has lessened. Japan <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51"
                            facs="0087"/>tends to stay in step, neither ahead nor behind, with our
                        European allies in its economic relationships with the Communist bloc and on
                        the topical issue of credit. Our influence on Japan in trading with
                        Communist China, as also in its trade with Cuba, is limited. Japan's
                        economic aid to the <gloss target="#t_LDCs1">LDC</gloss>s has, and will
                        continue to have, a strong commercial tinge; there is, however, a growing
                        awareness of a political need to introduce new directions and dimensions
                        into Japan's programs. We should continue to encourage Japan in such new
                        efforts, particularly as they relate to Asia.</p>
                    <p>In our bilateral affairs frictions exist partly because our relationship is
                        intimate and huge, but also because we are giving insufficient recognition
                        to the fact Japan now has wide-ranging legitimate interests to protect, for
                        example, in civil aviation and high-seas fishing. These frictions are
                        generating a potential for psychological exploitation decidedly
                        disadvantageous to long-range U.S. policy objectives. We should recognize
                        and understand the issues which expose sensitive Japanese nerves of prestige
                        and sovereignty, and do now what, in any event, we are likely to be obliged
                        to do a little later.</p>
                    <p>An important objective of our policy toward Japan is the promotion of a
                        healthy and moderate outlook on the part of the Japanese intellectual
                        community. Evidence that we have had considerable success is visible and
                        even accelerating. In the short period since the end of the war, broad and
                        continually expanding relationships have been developed between Americans
                        and Japanese in all fields of intellectual, artistic and professional
                        endeavor. In the last several years especially, an ever-growing number of
                        Japanese intellectuals and/or academicians have begun to voice increasing
                        skepticism, and in some cases outright rejection, of the Marxist
                        interpretation of political, economic and social phenomena. This has been
                        accompanied by a growing willingness to participate in a meaningful dialogue
                        with American colleagues. It is of utmost importance that this trend be
                        exploited through continuing emphasis on programs (both government and
                        private) which seek to expand the opportunities for contact and promote a
                        wider understanding in Japan of U.S. institutions and policies. The Japanese
                        intellectual community commands a public voice out of all proportion to its
                        numerical strength, and as a result its sentiments have much influence in
                        the determination of Japan's response to the entire gamut of U.S. policy
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, our policy of promoting a stronger Japan is succeeding
                        remarkably well, but mainly because the Japanese themselves are able and
                        intend to grow more powerful. Our goal of persuading Japan to act in concert
                        with U.S. and Free World interests is also succeeding to a large extent,
                        though it must be recognized that the growing power of Japan inevitably
                        makes it less responsive to American influence. This does not mean that
                        Japan is not likely to continue to act <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0088"
                        />largely in concert with us or that we lack all persuasive power. It does
                        mean, however, that we must recognize and project visibly a real sense of
                        equality between the two countries and must be ready to go halfway towards
                        meeting Japan's needs in order to achieve this relationship. This requires
                        us to tailor our approach so as to accommodate ourselves to Japanese
                        viewpoints and actions which differ from our own without being at cross
                        purposes (e.g., <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>–<gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> normalization; economic cooperation with
                        Asian <gloss target="#t_LDCs1">LDC</gloss>s) and to seek to maintain a
                        dialogue between equals on matters of dispute without either seeming to
                        preach or to threaten. In other words, it requires a continuing conscious
                        effort to place our relationship with Japan on a footing more like that with
                        the United Kingdom. Japan's growing sense of complete independence is not
                        now, at least, leading the country in the direction of neutralism and
                        disassociation from the United States. In fact, it seems to be leading it
                        closer to us. It is at the same time making the Japanese more insistent on
                        having a greater voice in common decisions. This is the inevitable result of
                        the success of the first part of our policy, which has been to help Japan to
                        become a major power center, and accommodating ourselves to this demand is
                        probably the key to success in the second part of our policy, which is to
                        keep a powerful Japan in step with U.S. and Free World objectives.</p>

                            common sense to have them oneself. Japanese public he realized was not
                            ready for this but would have to be educated to this point, and he felt
                            younger generation showed hopeful signs of going this way. Nuclears he
                            had discovered were much less costly than was generally assumed and
                            Japanese scientific and industrial level was fully up to producing them.
                            He then hastily added that, of course, Japan had none of “imperialistic”
                            ambitions of past so U.S. should not be worried by what he said. In next
                            few years he felt Japan must basically rethink whole defense problem. In

                            and I find he indeed lives up to reputation of being less judiciously

                            forthrightness and enthusiasm are refreshing, but I see grave dangers

                            his views which are bound to leak out to some extent could set off some
                            serious repercussions in Japan. For these reasons I believe

                                (and I doubt Japanese quite ready for it yet), we should be
                                addressing ourselves as a matter of priority to a fundamental study
                                of what we would like to see as Japanese defense role and US-Japan
                                military relationship over next ten to twenty years in order to be
                                ready for talks when Japanese propose them, which I believe likely
                                to happen soon and almost certainly within next three years.”

                            GRC would not give up its claim to be only China and therefore present
                            balanced Japanese policy toward two Chinas would have to be maintained,

                            “independent Taiwan” would be necessary. He sounded much more hopeful

                        important economic problems of common concern to the U.S. and Japan. These

                            but not printed.</note> and are related to the proposed U.S. policy
                        actions outlined in Tab C. Of the eleven specific issues summarized in Tab
                        B, the first five items represent areas in which the United States desires
                        an improvement in Japanese performance;<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">The five
                            items were U.S.-Japan Defense Relations, Aid to the Developing
                            Countries, Japan's Trade with the Communist Bloc, Direct Investment, and
                            the Kennedy Round.</note> the remaining six items represent areas in

                    <p>For some time, the Department has considered means to engage the full and
                        active support of your Cabinet colleagues in a common effort to eliminate
                        needless difficulties in current U.S.-Japanese economic relations. Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s visit offers an
                        occasion for review with your Cabinet colleagues the nature of the problem
                        against the backdrop of our total relationship with Japan to gain their
                        understanding and support of positions you will take, and to anticipate
                        subsequent U.S. actions which will be required to implement those positions
                        set forth in Part II of Tab C. We have discussed these issues with working
                        levels in the other agencies concerned and shall have obtained clearances or
                        identified differences before any meeting you might hold with your
                        colleagues. We believe that reconciliation of the differences between the
                        State and Commerce Departments on textiles will require your intercession
                        with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName>, bilaterally or
                        in the context of discussion with other Cabinet colleagues of our total

                            >Sato</persName> meeting, prepared by my colleague, <persName>James
                            Thomson</persName> (whom you may not have met but will see in my place
                        at the dinner tomorrow night—in line with your policy of rotating White
                        House invitations). Thomson's memo gives some of the details around the main
                        problem, but I repeat my own conviction that it is item 3 on Communist China
                        and Taiwan, which is the heart of the matter. If <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> can take away a sense of your own realistic awareness
                        that this problem will get bigger and bigger and that we want to go at it in
                        close cooperation with the Japanese, that will be all he needs for the
                        present. As I said on the phone, my own belief is that the key to <gloss

                        press Chiang &amp; Company not to be the first to quit when some ambiguous

                                        Korea is an essential buffer to us, doubly essential to
                                        Japan. Nothing the Japanese could do right now, in 1965,
                                        would advance the Free World's interests more successfully

                        the photographer, Mr. Okamoto, was of Japanese extraction. The Prime
                        Minister was curious whether he was a Nisei. The President showed a photo of
                        his ranch and photographic portraits of his daughters, Lynda and Luci.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would not show his entire album but did wish to
                        demonstrate what a fine job the photographer had done. He showed a picture
                        of Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                        with Generals LeMay and <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>,
                        which had been taken at his ranch. He said that Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had asked him to find out if the
                        Prime Minister had a few billion dollars extra. The President commented that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> needs more money for
                        defense. The Prime Minister asked if the President had some funds hidden in
                        his pocket.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister expressed his gratification to the President for the warm
                        reception he had been given at the White House.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he had an enduring friendship for the Japanese people
                        and their government, especially this one. He noted that Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName>'s reports are all good
                        and reflect favorably upon Japan. He commented that the Prime Minister is a
                        pragmatist, like himself.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan is a democratic nation, as the President
                        knew, and as a politician he would understand that it is important to
                        consider the people.</p>

                    <p>The President reminisced about his boyhood in Texas. He said that he was
                        raised near San Antonio, and the Prime Minister commented that he had
                        visited there as a young man. The President said that he had always looked
                        west. He recalled that his grandfather had had to look east, to New York,
                        for money in those days. Our Government leaders are proud of our European
                        allies in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, to the east, but we also
                        wish to develop another strong alliance with Japan where we turn our heads
                        toward the sun as it sets in the west. He had tried to convey this thought
                        in his welcoming remarks this morning. It is not a habit with us to look
                        always east to Europe; we look as well to other parts of the world.</p>
                    <p>The President said that a number of items were listed for discussion and he
                        wondered what were the Prime Minister's interests. The list included the
                        Ryukyu Islands; Bonin Islands graves visits; the Saylor Amendment;
                        Japan-Korea normalization; Communist China and Taiwan; Pacific area defense;
                        and South Viet-Nam and Southeast Asia. The President asked the Prime
                        Minister to mention any other issues in which he had an interest. The
                        President said that he also was anxious to hear the Prime Minister's views
                        on the Pacific area. He wanted to get a feeling for the Prime Minister's
                        opinions, and afford the Prime Minister the same opportunity to sound out
                        his views; these matters could then be discussed more profitably. The
                        President said that he and the Prime Minister were the ones who had to take
                        the blame when anything went wrong.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that the greatest problems center around Communist
                        China and South Viet-Nam, and an exchange of views is needed on those
                        issues. He added that a new problem has arisen as a result of President
                        Sukarno taking Indonesia out of the United Nations. The Prime Minister then
                        asked the President to explain the position of the United States with
                        reference to holding the 38th parallel in Korea and regarding the defense of
                        Taiwan. He inquired whether the President could make a commitment not to
                        withdraw from South Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>The President said, first, that the Prime Minister could depend on us fully
                        for defense in the Pacific area. He said it is clear that Japan relies on
                        the United States for defense, or else Japan would be creating its own
                        independent defense systems. Second, he said that the Prime Minister could
                        rely on the United States to consult closely with Japan before making any
                        crucial decisions involving policy changes on the China problem and matters
                        of comparable importance. The President expressed a desire to discuss these
                        issues with the Prime Minister and understand fully the problems involved
                        before taking action.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the main problem involving the Republic of China's
                        retention of its United Nations seat is that the Nationalist Chinese not get
                        angry and walk out of the United Nations. If the <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68"
                            facs="0104"/>Nationalists do not walk out then the Chinese Communists
                        will not soon gain admission to the United Nations. The President said that
                        what we want to do is keep down the Nationalist Chinese blood pressure, so
                        that they won't do something rash that might enable the Communist Chinese to
                        enter the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>Photographer Okamoto entered the office and was introduced by the President
                        as his friend. The President asked whether he was born in the United States
                        or Japan. Mr. Okamoto said that he had been born and raised in this country,
                        and that his home is in Bronxville, New York. His father is in Japan, in his
                        home town near Yokohama; his mother is in New York, and her home town is
                        Kyoto. He has no brothers or sisters in Japan, but had been told that he has
                        many uncles.</p>
                    <p>Continuing his comments on the China situation, which he remarked is a
                        problem for him as it is for the Prime Minister, the President said that
                        what we must do is to keep the Nationalist Chinese from upsetting the
                        situation, or to forestall their doing so as long as we can. In order to
                        keep the Chinese Communists from walking in, we don't want the Nationalist
                        Chinese to walk out. He affirmed that the United States and Japan should
                        have the closest consultation on this matter and commented that Ambassadors
                            <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> and
                            <persName>Takeuchi</persName> are already devoting their attention to
                        it. He said that he had asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1"
                            >Reischauer</persName> to remain at his post and to keep the Prime
                        Minister informed of developments.</p>
                    <p>The President said that attention would have to be given to the problem of
                        trade with China, as it is a nation of 600 million people. The President
                        noted that Japan regards trade and political relations with Communist China
                        as separate matters.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister confirmed that politics and trade are differentiated in
                        Japan's contacts with mainland China. He said that Japan cannot ignore the
                        mainland's propinquity and its long history of cultural contact with the
                        Chinese. Therefore, Japan has developed trade relations with the mainland.
                        However, Japan maintains diplomatic and treaty relations with the Republic
                        of China. He said that Japan is in the same boat as the United States, and
                        does not wish to anger Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
                    <p>The President solicited the Prime Minister's analysis of the China situation
                        as it might emerge in two or three years.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister reiterated that it is essential that we consult closely on
                        this matter. We cannot deny that a situation might develop in which
                        Communist China could be admitted to the United Nations. This possibility
                        puts us in a critical position. He said that the Communist China question is
                        of an even more urgent nature than the Viet-Nam problem.</p>
                    <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0105"/>
                    <p>The President emphasized our hope that the Communist Chinese will leave their
                        neighbors alone and turn their attention to internal affairs.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that this would be difficult for them to do, since
                        they are communists. However, Mao Tse-tung will not live forever. On the
                        other hand, Chiang may not live too much longer either. He said that we
                        should not be unduly hasty with respect to Communist China lest we create
                        new problems. Communist China will continue to pose serious difficulties
                        until it has completed its revolutionary phase. This evolutionary process
                        has been witnessed before in the history of China. The Shin [Chin]<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">Brackets in the source text.</note> and Mongol
                        dynasties provide examples. The Prime Minister said that 40 years have
                        passed since the Soviet revolution, during which time the regime has matured
                        and changed. But only a decade and a half have passed since the Chinese
                        Communist revolution which is still in an early stage.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed. He said that this is a great problem for the Prime
                        Minister and himself.</p>
                    <p>The President said that Viet-Nam is another major problem, and it could
                        worsen if no stable government can be established. If none is, we could be
                        out tomorrow. The President stressed what he said in his State of the Union
                        message: we intend to stay in Viet-Nam and we will do more rather than
                            less.<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">The text of the State of the Union

                        President asked how hopeful the Prime Minister was about the situation in
                        Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that the United States must hold out and be patient.
                        The United States is an outsider which has sent in troops, whereas the
                        opposition is native. He said that the United States should work for the
                        establishment of a liberal atmosphere that would enable the government to
                        gain the support of the people. Above all, popular sentiment must be
                        understood and channeled in politically constructive ways.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister indicated that the United States should not think in terms
                        of pursuit to the north which he rejected, but should rather lend its
                        efforts to such ventures as the establishment of model communities in South
                        Viet-Nam, especially around Saigon. He believed that the biggest headache
                        for the United States is the absence of leaders who could form a reliable
                        government.</p>
                    <p>The President interposed that our headache is bigger than that. He said we
                        intend to stay in Viet-Nam so long as our assistance is sought by the
                        Vietnamese people. The answer to the Prime Minister's earlier <pb n="70"
                            xml:id="pg_70" facs="0106"/>question whether the United States is
                        committed not to withdraw from Viet-Nam was yes.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister applauded the United States determination to maintain a
                        firm stand in Viet-Nam and reiterated his desire that we hold out.</p>
                    <p>The President said in reply to a question that Prime Minister phrased about
                        defense that, since Japan possesses no nuclear weapons, and we do have them,
                        if Japan needs our nuclear deterrent for its defense, the United States
                        would stand by its commitments and provide that defense. The President asked
                        whether that struck at the heart of the Prime Minister's question. The Prime
                        Minister confirmed that that is what he would like to ask but said that he
                        is unable to say so publicly. The President said that his reply on the
                        defense of Japan is affirmative, adding that this exchange befits statesmen
                        of the type he and the Prime Minister wish to be in the interest of their
                        peoples.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether the Prime Minister wished to discuss any foreign
                        policy matters other than China, Viet-Nam, and security arrangements. The
                        Prime Minister replied that he was concerned about developments in Malaysia
                        and Indonesia.</p>
                    <p>The President explained that Sukarno's character is a crucial element in the
                        situation. He is impulsive and impetuous, and if he gets too upset we are
                        fearful that he will create even more serious problems. He said that the
                        U.S. is lending its influence to ameliorate this problem in every way
                        possible. The Prime Minister cautioned that we should avoid actions which
                        would drive Sukarno, and with him Indonesia, into the arms of Communist
                        China.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the United States is exercising extreme forebearance
                        in trying to prevent this. He said that Sukarno had insulted the United
                        States recently but he was prepared to overlook this in the light of our
                        larger interests. The week following Sukarno's statements, the United States
                        delivered food valued at several million dollars to Indonesia under the
                        terms of an agreement reached three years ago. President Kennedy had been
                        severely criticized in the Senate when he executed his agreement. The
                        President said that the United States is following a policy of conciliation
                        in regard to the Indonesian problem and is trying not to be
                        inflammatory.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan is still on speaking terms with Indonesia,
                        and is willing to do what it can. The Prime Minister indicated that
                        consultations with Great Britain about Indonesia might be desirable. The
                        President replied that any contributions to a solution would be
                        welcomed.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that he wished to refer to one major problem in which
                        the prospects were somewhat brighter. He said that a settlement between
                        Japan and South Korea should be forthcoming soon. <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71"
                            facs="0107"/>He noted that internal political considerations in Korea
                        seem to be the only barrier to an early settlement. The President said yes,
                        he understood.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister raised the question whether the President would be
                        interested in visiting Japan. The President said that he hoped very much
                        that he would have an opportunity to do so. He characterized Japan as a
                        country that excites and interests him. He noted that many members of his
                        Cabinet family had been there, including the six Cabinet members who were en
                        route to Japan at the time of the assassination of President Kennedy. In
                        time, such a visit could be worked out.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister asked whether he could reply to a question in his press
                        conference that he had asked the President about making a trip to Japan. The
                        President expressed his approval and said that he would confirm that the
                        Prime Minister did extend an invitation during one of his own press
                        conferences. The President said that he is most interested in being a close
                        friend to Japan. He commented that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_USL1"
                            >Udall</persName> had gone mountain climbing in Japan; and he and other
                        Americans have all reported that Japan is a wonderful country. He expressed
                        the hope that he would be able to visit the Prime Minister during his term
                        of office.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE6"
                            >Shiina</persName> would proceed to London following the present talks
                        to participate in a regular British-Japanese consultation. Since Britain is
                        one of the nations which recognizes Communist China, the Prime Minister
                        wondered whether it would be useful to have the Foreign Minister consult
                        with the British to gain their assistance with respect to the Viet-Nam
                        question.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he would speak to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> about this, but that we have already
                        made strong appeals to our friends to do all they can. But it seems that all
                        of our friends are under the bridge or hiding in caves. It would be useful
                        if they would take some constructive action. Even a strong speech would
                        help. The United States has 25,000 men in Viet-Nam and we need dollars to
                        continue this assistance. Some would like us to withdraw but we will not do
                        so.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the United States will be dealing increasingly with
                        major powers such as Britain, Japan, and Germany in trying to resolve the
                        Viet-Nam and other crisis situations in Asia. With respect to Japan's
                        security, Japan need not give even a second thought to the dependability of
                        its American ally. If Japan is attacked, the United States will contribute
                        to its defense. Similarly, the United States will abide by commitments to
                        its other allies. The United States will remain in Viet-Nam as long as the
                        Vietnamese let us. It would be very helpful, however, if the President were
                        able to point out to the American people tangible assistance extended to
                        Viet-Nam by our friends, <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0108"/>such as
                        money or the medical task force which Japan has sent there. The United
                        States investment in Viet-Nam is four or five billion dollars. We seem to be
                        alone, and the President wondered where Britain, Japan and Germany were.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he would summarize his statements in conclusion
                        because the others were waiting in the Cabinet Room and they would also like
                        to talk with the Prime Minister. The United States is conciliatory toward
                        Indonesia. When Sukarno told us off, the President turned the other cheek.
                        When he told us to go jump in the lake, we sent him food. We have no desire
                        to drive Sukarno into the arms of Communism. If he does go, he will do so
                        out of his own decision.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan will do all it can to assist in these
                        problems, and noted the success of the medical task force which Japan had
                        sent to South Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>The President said he understood that Japan's contribution cost $1.5 million.
                        He appreciated dispatch of the medical task force and said that it would be
                        helpful if Japan could show the flag. If Japan gets in trouble, we would
                        send our planes and bombs to defend her. We are now in trouble in Viet-Nam
                        and ask how Japan can help us. He indicated that the Prime Minister need not
                        publicize these views at home. The President said, however, that he himself
                        would do so with the members of the Senate. Any statement of support by the
                        Prime Minister would, of course, help.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he heard a lot about trade problems between our two
                        countries, related to cotton textiles, woolen goods, television sets such as
                        Sony, and other things the Japanese produce so efficiently. He had also been
                        informed of the Japanese desire to extend their air routes. He invited the
                        Prime Minister's views on the major outstanding bilateral trade
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that, in his view, the major problem is to sustain
                        the prosperity of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The President said that textile representatives in the United States are
                        extremely concerned about the import of Japanese woolens. The Prime Minister
                        indicated that he preferred to reserve the discussion of the textiles and
                        civil aviation problems for his meeting with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that, while we have worked out the problems of cotton
                        textiles, we now have a problem with woolen textiles. The President said
                        that he daily confronts a number of Senators who jump down his throat
                        because of problems arising from Japanese imports. He said we have to watch
                        that and exercise restraint. He said that RCA is fussing with him about Sony
                        television sets. He commented that, nevertheless, he had some Sony
                        television sets and led the Prime Minister into his private study where he
                        showed him three miniature <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0109"/>Sony
                        television sets, each tuned to a different network. He demonstrated for the
                        Prime Minister a control device by which he could tune in on the audio
                        portion of any of the three. He said that he had these sets on
                        constantly.</p>
                    <p>With respect to trade with Japan, the President said the United States wants
                        to trade and considers its commercial relationship with Japan to be
                        extremely important. Japan buys American cotton. On the other hand, Japanese
                        woolen exports to the United States create difficult problems because the
                        industry is depressed. The President said that he would appreciate anything
                        Japan could do to help alleviate this situation, for he had 50 Senators
                        after him on it.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said he wondered why so relatively small an export item as
                        woolens should be such a problem when Japan buys so much from the United
                        States. The President said this is because the industry is badly depressed.
                        When a baby does not get milk he cries.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that he still found it difficult to understand
                        complaints about Japanese trade, particularly those which originate in areas
                        of soy bean production, since Japan purchases $100 million worth of soy
                        beans from the United States and exports only $1 million worth of woolen
                        textiles.</p>
                    <p>The President said that if the situation were reversed he is sure he would
                        hear about it. As a politician the Prime Minister could understand why he
                        (the President) would hear complaints from those in a depressed
                        industry.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that since President <persName>Johnson</persName> is
                        from Texas, a cotton-producing state, in contrast to President Kennedy, who
                        was from a textile-manufacturing state, he had anticipated a different
                        attitude with respect to textile problems. He said that he hoped the
                        President could handle these problems, which he believed stem fundamentally
                        from domestic considerations in the United States rather than from Japan's
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>The President said he appreciated this point, but every day he sees
                        representatives of the textile industry and, since he gets so much criticism
                        from this area, he hoped that the Prime Minister could do something at his
                        end to alleviate the situation. Every morning he received calls from textile
                        manufacturers complaining about Japanese textiles. The President said he did
                        not wish to make this a major point of the discussion, but he must live at
                        home just as the Prime Minister must. The Prime Minister said that
                        representatives of the woolen textile industry in Japan had told him prior
                        to his departure for the United States not to raise the issue of woolen
                        textiles in Washington.</p>
                    <p>The President commented in a lighter vein that textiles and civil aviation
                        could probably be discussed all day. The Prime Minister made the point that
                        civil aviation is a different matter because Japanese <pb n="74"
                            xml:id="pg_74" facs="0110"/>airlines use American planes exclusively.
                        The President said that the American airline companies do not manufacture
                        aircraft and this point is lost on them. The Prime Minister expressed his
                        understanding of that situation.</p>
                    <p>The President said that both he and the Prime Minister were the new leaders
                        of great nations which have promising futures and that problems between us
                        could be resolved through give-and-take discussions on the basis of fairness
                        and justice. We must understand that it is essential that we communicate
                        with each other freely, frankly, and in a friendly manner. He said that he
                        would be available later in the visit to discuss any problem the Prime
                        Minister wished to raise.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his appreciation and pleasure at the warm treatment
                        accorded American Cabinet officers who had visited Japan. He said he was
                        proud of the manner in which Japan has rebuilt itself over the past 20
                        years. He said that he could understand the problems a new Prime Minister
                        might face and offered to help to the extent possible. The President
                        cautioned the Prime Minister to exercise care in his statements about
                        outstanding problems between the United States and Japan that might make it
                        more difficult for the President to cope with United States domestic
                        pressures on these issues.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister referred once again to his invitation to the President to
                        visit Japan. The President reiterated how much he would like to make the
                        trip. He cited his great interest in the people and the country and
                        confirmed that he would like to visit at an appropriate time during his term
                        of office. The Prime Minister remarked that the President's term of office
                        will undoubtedly be eight years and it would be too long to wait until the
                        latter part of this period to have him visit Japan.</p>
                    <p>The President said that a very good friend of his, Mr. Youngman, an insurance
                        company executive presently working in Japan, would be at dinner. He wanted
                        to introduce him to the Prime Minister because Mr. Youngman, just as many
                        other Americans, speaks very favorably of the people of Japan.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether the Prime Minister had any other matters to
                        discuss confidentially before joining the 30 people waiting in the Cabinet
                        Room.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that it was not necessary to add to what had already
                        been said.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he felt he had gotten to know the Prime Minister and
                        hoped that the Prime Minister also felt that they had gotten their personal
                        relationship off on a good footing. The President said that they now had
                        their own private treaty which is just as binding as any treaty ratified by
                        the Senate.</p>
                    <p>He then escorted the Prime Minister and other members of the group into the
                        Cabinet Room.</p>

                        members of the group after approximately 45 minutes' private conversation.
                        The President said that the Prime Minister and he had discussed several
                        matters, which might perhaps be pursued further in the larger group.</p>

                    <p>The President said that the United States and Japanese Governments should be
                        careful to consult on everything of concern to the other. He said that he
                        had great confidence in Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> and was very proud of the record he had made. The
                        President said to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1"
                            >Reischauer</persName> that he had told the Prime Minister he was also
                            <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0112"/>proud of the Ambassador's record
                        and that he had asked him to stay on in his post. The President said that he
                        sometimes felt that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1"
                            >Reischauer</persName> worked part time for the United States but most
                        of the time for the Prime Minister—maybe the Prime Minister was nicer to
                        work for than the President.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he wished to
                        mention briefly Okinawa and the Bonins. He said that Japan fully agreed with
                        the United States on the importance and necessity of the U.S. military
                        installations on Okinawa to peace in the Far East. Due to U.S. commitments
                        under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the Chinese Communist nuclear
                            explosion<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">The Communist Chinese detonated
                            their first nuclear weapon on October 16, 1964.</note> had not had great
                        impact in Japan. Japan has residual sovereignty in the Ryukyus, but
                        administrative authority is exercised by the United States. The nearly one
                        million Ryukyuans and 95 million Japanese ardently aspire to the return of
                        administrative authority over the islands to Japan. It had been twenty years
                        since the U.S. assumed control there. He was sure that the President
                        understood what the feelings of the people of Okinawa and Japan on this
                        matter are. He would like to see more respect by the United States for the
                        problem of expanding the autonomy of the Ryukyuan people and of increasing
                        their political and social freedom. Improved cooperation of the Ryukyuan
                        people in the islands' administration would enable the United States to
                        carry out its security mission more effectively.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the United States is prepared to broaden the scope of
                        the Consultative Committee<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">The United States and
                            Japan signed an agreement on April 2, 1965, to broaden the functions of
                            the Consultative Committee on the Ryukyu Islands. Henceforth the scope
                            of the Committee's role was no longer limited to considering “economic
                            assistance to the Ryukyu Islands” but included “other matters on which
                            Japan and the United States can cooperate in continuing to promote the
                            well-being of the inhabitants of the islands.” The text of the agreement
                            is in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                1965</hi>, p. 771.</note> so that it can go in much more depth into
                        matters of the welfare of the people of the Ryukyu Islands. As he believed
                        he had already told the Prime Minister in their private meeting, the United
                        States is also willing to accept in principle a Bonin Islands graves
                        visit.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said that the
                        Ryukyus and the Bonins were well covered in the Communiqué.<note n="4"

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked to what extent the
                        Chinese Communist nuclear explosion had changed reservations among the
                        Japanese people concerning the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and concerning the
                        U.S. military <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0113"/>presence in Okinawa.
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said that the
                        majority of Japanese feel that Japan's security rests on the Treaty with the
                        United States. As regards Japanese public attitudes on nuclear weapons, the
                        public's feeling is that Japan should never possess them, nor should any
                        situation be created where their use would be necessary. The Prime Minister
                        said that although he could see why it might be argued that if China has
                        nuclear weapons, Japan should also, this was not Japan's policy.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that there was a strong desire on the part of the
                        people of Okinawa for him to visit the Islands. He believed, however, that a
                        visit at this time would create problems and should be deferred until it
                        could be assured that it would be useful.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he was sure the
                        Prime Minister understood that the President had sent one of our most
                        experienced and thoughtful officers to Okinawa as High Commissioner. He had
                        served in Berlin and understood the political as well as the administrative
                        and military aspects. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1"
                            >Watson</persName>'s appointment had in itself improved the situation,
                        and we would wish in the Consultative Committee to find out if further
                        improvement could be achieved. The President said that the Prime Minister
                        could be assured that we were prepared to broaden the consultative process
                        in every way we could to help improve the welfare of the Ryukyuan
                        people.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that when he met General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WMGAII1">Watson</persName> in Tokyo he had found him to be a
                        fine individual. He would discuss the timing of his (the Prime Minister's)
                        possible visit to Okinawa with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1"
                            >Reischauer</persName>, to ensure that it had a constructive effect.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that in his private discussion with the President,
                        the President had mentioned that he was having a great deal of trouble with
                        the U.S. woolen industry. He had told the President that before leaving
                        Japan he had been told by the Japanese woolen industry that he should keep
                        his mouth shut on the subject. He had told the President that he appreciated
                        that this is a “family matter.” Better understanding should be sought on
                        both sides, in an effort to ameliorate the situation.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would like the Prime Minister to tell him frankly what
                        he thought the U.S. could do in Viet-Nam that we are not doing and what
                        Japan could do there that it is not doing. The Prime Minister said that he
                        did not wish to comment too much on the situation in Viet-Nam, in view of
                        the United States' thorough familiarity with that situation. He felt,
                        however, that utmost patience and forebearance were required. Neither an
                        advance north nor American withdrawal was desirable. The latter would
                        provoke a “falling domino” situation. The United States should hold on.
                        Since the Vietnamese are within their own country and the United States is
                        an outsider, the United States must exercise patience and perseverance. The
                        crux of the <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0114"/>problem was to achieve
                        stable South Vietnamese leadership. The Prime Minister said he knew the
                        United States was endeavoring to capture public sentiment and stabilize the
                        people's livelihood. He expressed sympathy and a desire to assist. Japan had
                        sent a medical team and other non-military aid to Viet-Nam at a cost of $1½
                        million. Japan would continue to cooperate through such means to the best of
                        its ability.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that unfortunately Japan could not utilize functional
                        bodies of the United Nations as a channel for its assistance to Viet-Nam. If
                        certain things could be done under the auspices of the United Nations, the
                        Japanese Government would have greater freedom to help.<note n="5"

                        the United Nations relationship to Viet-Nam was under study. The Prime
                        Minister said that in the absence of a United Nations channel the Japanese
                        Government was trying to figure out ways and means to assist the United
                        States more effectively in Viet-Nam. A group of conservative Diet members
                        had gone to Viet-Nam to examine the situation at first hand. On its return
                        to Japan it would try to create a more favorable public opinion for Japanese
                        assistance to the United States effort there. After 20 years the people of
                        Viet-Nam are tired of war.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that during the

                        agreed on the importance of preventing the People's Republic of China from
                        being seated in the United Nations and to remain in close contact on

                            >Sato</persName> and his party to the Cabinet room at 11:30 January 13.
                        Prior to the start of the conversation across the table, there was extended
                        discussion among members of the Prime Minister's party of a memorandum
                        prepared by Dr. Hornig on a United States-Japan program of cooperation in
                        medical science. The Japanese were given a program and asked to consider a
                        summary paragraph for possible inclusion in the Communiqué.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said to the
                        President that he could agree to inclusion of reference to an expanded
                        program of cooperation in medical science in the Communiqué,<note n="2"

                            in Asia and problems caused by air pollution and pesticides. (<hi

                        the program itself, however, he wished to <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81"
                            facs="0117"/>be offered the opportunity of submitting it for careful

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> stated that it could
                        then be agreed that reference to the program would be in the Communiqué. He
                        went on to say that the program itself would require a good deal of study on
                        the United States side. He mentioned that the Secretary of State believed
                        that other countries might participate in the program, those likely to be
                        the principal beneficiaries as well as those likely to have something to
                        contribute.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said, in very cordial terms, that he was glad that the
                        President had seen fit to make the proposal of cooperation in the field of
                        medical science and to suggest inclusion of agreement on this matter in the
                        Communiqué.</p>

                        President expressed gratification that the Secretary had had an extended and
                        satisfactory conversation with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> and his colleagues. He then indicated his very great
                        interest in space exploration and said that he would like to know about
                        Japanese planning in this field.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> replied that Japan
                        was anxious to further space developments. It aspired to be number three,
                        after the United States and the USSR, in this field. He set aside the French
                        as being vitally dependent upon United States resources. Japan, on the other
                        hand, wanted its efforts to be based on its own capability. Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> confessed to a special,
                        personal interest in the program, inasmuch as he had previously been
                        Director-General for Science in the Japanese Government. Secretary General
                            <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> interjected that Japan
                        regarded its space efforts to have export possibilities. In fact, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> said, Japan had already
                        exported equipment to Yugoslavia. The Prime Minister went on to observe that
                        if necessity arose rocket and missile development could, of course, be
                        converted from peaceful to military uses. Important studies were proceeding,
                        he said, on both liquid and solid fuel propulsion systems.</p>
                    <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0118"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> inquired whether the
                        Japanese imposed safeguards on exports of these items to forestall
                        conversion to military use.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he was not
                        sure whether such conditions were applied but attempted to reassure the
                        Secretary by stating that those already exported were not suitable for
                        military uses. He added that India had made inquiries about the availability
                        of rocket exports.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that he was
                        pleased with the United States effort in the field of space developments and
                        hoped to keep our programs on schedule; some $5 billion would be
                        appropriated this coming year for NASA plus $2 billion for other agencies.
                        The President said to the Prime Minister that the United States was prepared
                        to cooperate with Japan and to be as helpful as we can in space
                        developments.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said that Japan's
                        most distinguished space scientist was Dr. Itakawa of the University of
                        Tokyo, who had come to the United States and had worked closely with the
                        Rand Corporation. The Prime Minister said that if it was the President's
                        wish, a visit with Itakawa could be arranged.</p>

                        the Mass Transit Bill which called for 100% Buy America procurement of
                        equipment. This was known as the Saylor Amendment.<note n="4"

                            corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that this provision in the law
                        had caused great displeasure to himself and the Administration. He assured
                        the Japanese Prime Minister that we were trying in every way we can to
                        prevent introduction of amendments of this sort by the Congress when they
                        were opposed to United States policy. The President and the Administration
                        would specifically try to get this provision removed from the law.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said that he hoped
                        that the removal would take place. He added that what was particularly
                        displeasing to the Japanese—who themselves practice “buy Japan” from time to
                        time— is to have “buy America” incorporated in legislation. The Japanese
                        have no provisions in their law calling for “buy Japan.” When purchasers are
                        asked to “buy Japan,” it is not, consequently, mandatory.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the Congress makes a good many things mandatory which
                        he wished it didn't. He then referred to an exhortation <pb n="83"
                            xml:id="pg_83" facs="0119"/>of Congressman Rayburn who used to say, he
                        said, “Let's talk before we vote: rather talk than fight.” The President
                        said that he was the target of calls from Congressmen who urged him to use
                        his influence to take certain actions which from their standpoint had life
                        or death implications. It was helpful for them to talk with others having
                        different interests and viewpoints. It would be very helpful, the President
                        added, if he could say, here in the United States, that Japan would welcome
                        appointment of committees where things could be talked over.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> replied that it
                        seemed to him essential to resort to talks when there was any indication of
                        imminent protective measures.</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> reminded the Prime
                        Minister that the day before he had talked about woolen textiles. He said
                        that he would like to consider asking members of the Congress, industry, and
                        Ministers of Commerce to go and talk to the Japanese. The Japanese, on their
                        side, he added, could say: “Look how much we buy of your cotton.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> said that Japan would like to take that
                        kind of approach. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> recalled
                        that he had suggested to Senator Mansfield yesterday that there should be
                        exchanges of legislators. Senator Mansfield was noncommittal, expressing
                        interest in how a precedent of this sort might be viewed by countries like
                        Australia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> said that where
                        enlightenment was needed, frank talk was very desirable.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> pursued further his
                        thought. He said that he could designate a group of people representing a
                        good cross-section of interests to discuss some particular problem with the
                        Japanese. After talks had been held they would, of course, come back and
                        talk over matters with much deeper understanding of realities.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> expressed the view
                        that this was an effective way to deal with specific issues.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> charged Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> with working through
                        plans designed to serve this desired purpose of talking things over.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> observed that when
                        either the President or the Secretary claimed to report the views of foreign
                        countries, the listener construed it as second-hand. The Japanese should
                        have an opportunity of saying what they had on their minds directly.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> quipped that the
                        Americans should wear even more woolen textiles—instead of synthetics. He
                        had made this point at his San Francisco press conference. More seriously,
                        he stated that sustained prosperity in the United States, and the market
                        thereby created for Japan, was of vital importance to Japan.</p>
                    <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0120"/>
                    <p>The President quipped in return that our exchanges of views had already begun
                        with the comments he had made the night before on Texas hats. And, the Prime
                        Minister replied that these represented an increase in United States exports
                        to Japan. Pleasantries about Texas hats—head measurements of his guests—a
                        call by the President for his Secretary, and making arrangements to bring in
                        some Texas1 hats for the neglected members of the Prime Minister's
                        delegation, occupied the next few minutes.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Japan Visit</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said that it was
                        with great seriousness and friendliness that he had extended to the
                        President an invitation to visit Japan. This had now become known and he
                        expected great press interest. He knew the President had indicated an
                        interest to go some time during his Administration but the Japanese would
                        not want to wait eight years. Could the President, he asked, indicate when a
                        visit might be practical?</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that his
                        Administration was just beginning. He had problems in organizing it and
                        establishing his relations with the Congress. He had already announced his
                        intention to make a trip or two. He would like very much, he said, to accept
                        the gracious invitation to visit Japan. He doubted that he could go in 1965.
                        He did want to go as early as possible. He asked for counsel from Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> on what might be told the
                        press. The President then reiterated the way he appreciated the invitation
                        and said that he wanted so much to go. His schedule for the first half of
                        1965 made it impossible. The probabilities for 1966 were good. The last half
                        of 1965 could be looked at in the light of developments in Washington.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said that he was
                        aware of President <persName>Johnson</persName>'s very heavy duties and only
                        hoped that the President would keep his invitation alive.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he had long felt that to know people better meant to
                        understand them better and to like them better. If the President and the
                        Prime Minister understood each other better and better so, he believed,
                        could their peoples. The President expressed a wish to play a part in this
                        process. He referred to the most favorable impression which Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> had produced upon guests at
                        the White House last night. His after dinner speech had made a deep imprint
                        on their minds. The President said that he hoped to win, when in Japan, some
                        of the Prime Minister's supporters as effectively as the Prime Minister had
                        won some of his.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> urged all present to
                        avoid encouraging speculation as to specific dates for a Presidential visit
                        to Japan. The Prime Minister gave his assurance that no indication of dates
                        would be given from the Japanese side.</p>

                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> made the last
                        comment of the meeting, in reiterating the great importance he attached to
                        travel and exchanges back and forth between Japan and the United States even
                        though there were no specific problems to be dealt with. He recalled the
                        fact that in Great Britain there were many who used to charge Japan with
                        dumping. This kind of talk has largely ended as British visitors have been
                        to Japan and in particular after the visit of observation made by Sir Norman
                        Kipping.</p>

                    <p>3802. For <persName>Bundy</persName> from Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>Not since the crisis over the U.S.-Japan security treaty in 1960 has any
                        issue so seriously affected the climate of Japanese-American relations <pb
                            n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0123"/>as the bombing of North Vietnam. The
                        government has publicly expressed its understanding of U.S. policy and has
                        given us “moral support,” but public opinion has been overwhelmingly
                        critical. Even government leaders, realizing the political danger of getting
                        too far out of line with public opinion, have tended to be somewhat
                        equivocal in their statements of support, being careful to emphasize hopes
                        that we will terminate or at least temporarily suspend bombing the North and
                        sometimes implying personal doubts as to the wisdom of U.S. policy.</p>
                    <p>This adverse Japanese reaction appears to be fundamentally a result of fear
                        that Japan might become involved in the war if it further escalates. So long
                        as the fighting remained safely small-scale and remote in the paddy fields
                        and forests of South Vietnam, Japanese interest in it was slight and almost
                        academic, since there seemed little likelihood of Japan becoming involved,
                        but the bombing of the North has put the war in an entirely new light. In a
                        sense it is to them a new war, “started” by the American bombing of the
                        North and made possible by the U.S. military presence in Southeast Asia.
                        Viewing the problem in this light, the easy way to terminate the war seems
                        to them to be to stop the bombing and eventually to terminate the U.S.
                        military presence in the area.</p>
                    <p>Such simplistic attitudes are possible in Japan because of the ostrich-like
                        pacifism of the Japanese during the past twenty years. Reacting in shock
                        against the horrors of the war they lost and safe behind the U.S. defense
                        screen, they have refused to look realistically at the security problems of
                        the world and have built up the myth that peace in Japan has been the
                        product of their “peace constitution,” not the U.S. defense posture in the
                        Far East. Such attitudes make it possible for many of them to feel that in
                        the present situation the presence of American military bases in Japan is a
                        greater threat to Japan's continued peace than are Communist expansionism
                        and intransigence.</p>
                    <p>These attitudes have been strengthened by the reporting of the Vietnamese
                        situation over the past several years. While the North can put on a unified
                        appearance of sweetness and light, from the South there has come a steady
                        stream of news reports (both Japanese and Eastern) of coups d'état,
                        government corruption and misrule, dissatisfaction and unrest among the
                        people, American ineptness in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs
                        and in relations with the government, and a rising tempo of civil war. Since
                        the fighting is seen largely from the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                        side, the reporting concentrates on government cruelty and disasters, while
                        VIET Cong terrorism and reverses are hardly mentioned.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and other Vietnamese who do not want
                        a Viet Cong victory, have not made their voices heard in Japan, and the
                        attitudes of the Thai and other SE Asians who support the <gloss
                            target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> are virtually ignored.</p>
                    <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0124"/>
                    <p>In addition there is a natural sympathy in Japan for the apparent “underdogs”
                        in the bombings, since they are racially, culturally and geographically
                        closer to the Japanese than are the caucasians who come from afar, armed
                        with superior weapons.</p>
                    <p>A final factor in the Japanese emotional response to the Vietnamese situation
                        is their ready identification of the American position with that of the
                        Japanese armies in China before and during the Second World War. Almost to a
                        man the Japanese think of the United States as having become bogged down in
                        a hopeless war against the nationalistically aroused people of Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Because of these basic emotional responses, spurred on by a lot of leftist
                        progaganda and invective, which are inevitable in Japan given its present
                        intellectual makeup, it is not surprising that a highly unfavorable view of
                        the Vietnamese war has emerged. The bulk of the Japanese attribute the war
                        basically to a dogmatic American anti-Communist crusade, which has forced us
                        to embrace militarists and unsavory dictators as our allies and has driven
                        the nationalistic masses into the arms of the Communists to defend their
                        freedom. The Japanese feel that instead of stressing economic and social
                        advances, the United States, increasingly under the influence of
                        militarists, has decided on a solely military solution, thus forcing
                        continued fighting on the war-weary people of Vietnam and leading ourselves
                        down the road to inevitable defeat. In this unhappy situation, all they feel
                        that they can do is to deplore American policy and see to it that Japan's
                        increasingly undesirable military association with the United States does
                        not get it involved in this unnecessary and unjust war.</p>
                    <p>Not all Japanese, of course, have reacted in this way. A considerable number
                        of conservatives strongly support our policies, and even more of them, while
                        doubtful of the wisdom of the course we have taken, are ready to support us
                        verbally as committed allies. (This is more or less the position of the
                        government.) The bulk of articulate public opinion, however, is clearly
                        against us. It is frenetically so on the far left but even in the middle of
                        the political spectrum is quite clearly condemnatory, even if more
                        sorrowfully and rationally so. The criticism is strongest among intellectual
                        groups, which tend to be Marxist-oriented, and therefore is probably
                        somewhat over-represented in the extremely adverse reactions of newspapers
                        and magazines (radio and television are somewhat more moderate), but these
                        attitudes are obviously shared to some extent by the man in the street. The
                        only available public opinion poll has shown a drop since January of this
                        year from 49 percent to 40 percent in those favoring alignment of Japan with
                        the free world and a corresponding rise from 22 to 32 percent of those
                        favoring neutralism. Similarly, the number of persons naming the United
                        States as one of their three favorite countries has dropped from 52 percent
                        to 38 percent since last December and those naming <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89"
                            facs="0125"/>the United States as a country they dislike has risen from
                        4 percent to 8 percent.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> and the consulates have
                        done their best, all up and down the line, to counter the adverse reaction
                        in Japan and to gain better understanding of the real situation in Vietnam
                        and U.S. policy there. We have received a great assist in this from
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> during his recent
                            visit.<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">During a 10-day visit in April,

                        have met with some success, and there is a growing awareness of the U.S.
                        point of view, which has perhaps blunted the attack somewhat, but the basic
                        emotional response remains unchanged and is probably unchangeable over the
                        short run. Our policies in Vietnam are unpopular because they stir up fears,
                        and the Japanese people are as yet emotionally unprepared to consider the
                        alternatives realistically and honestly. It is our judgment that the
                        reaction will remain basically adverse and we shall continue to lose ground
                        in Japanese-American relations so long as the war continues in its present
                        indecisive form. Only a rather clear-cut success for American policies is
                        likely to reverse the trend.</p>
                    <p>One good thing could come out of the present situation. For the first time
                        since the war the Japanese people have become thoroughly aroused over an
                        international crisis not immediately affecting themselves. Their reactions
                        are understandably naïve, but their concern may be a first step in an
                        educational process which may lead in time to a more realistic attitude
                        toward defense and international peace and to the assumption of greater
                        responsibility in economic development in Asia.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise the results of the situation seem entirely adverse to American

                    <p>The Japanese reaction to the Vietnam situation is, of course, only a minor
                        consideration compared to many others in reaching decisions on Vietnam
                        policy. It should be remembered, however, that over the long run the
                        attitude of Japan toward the U.S. and toward neighboring Asian areas is of
                        the greatest importance to the U.S. Therefore we 1) must make every effort
                        to achieve a more understanding and sympathetic response in Japan to our
                        Vietnamese policy, 2) should bear Japanese reactions in mind in arriving at
                        our decisions on Vietnam, and 3) should take into careful consideration the
                        present adverse reaction to U.S. policies in handling our other contacts and
                        negotiations with the Japanese so as not to further worsen an already

                                President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> agreed at
                                their meeting in last January that the two governments would make
                                efforts so as to attain mutually acceptable and equitable solutions
                                to issues pending between Japan and the United States, such as those
                                concerning the air transport agreement and fisheries.</p>
                            <p>Pursuant to this agreement, the Japanese side has repeatedly
                                requested the US side through Ambassador
                                    <persName>Takeuchi</persName> and other channels to resume the
                                air agreement negotiations, but has not yet received any reply.</p>
                            <p>Due to such circumstances, public opinion in Japan has been hardened
                                on this matter, and the Diet has recently adopted a firm resolution
                                demanding a satisfactory revision of the present air routes between
                                Japan and the United States.</p>

                            <p>Moreover, the Diet decided on its own judgment to send a group of its
                                members headed by Mr. Takashi Hasegawa, Chairman of the
                                Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives, to the
                                United States. However, the US side requested the postponement of
                                this visit.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese Government decided to comply with this request trusting
                                that the US Government would make the utmost efforts so that a
                                mutually satisfactory decision on the solution of this issue would
                                be made by the President, and took it upon itself to persuade the
                                Diet members concerned to postpone the visit for the time being. It
                                should be noted that it is exceptional and difficult for the
                                government to persuade the Diet in this manner.</p>

                        <item>In view of the above circumstances, public opinion in Japan,
                            particularly in the Diet, would inevitably be stiffened if the decision
                            of the President on this matter be further delayed or be unsatisfactory

                    </list>
                    <p>Therefore, the Japanese side wishes to point out that an early and
                        satisfactory solution of this issue has become a matter of great urgency,
                        and to request the US Government to concentrate its utmost efforts for the
                        solution of this longstanding issue. End verbatim text.</p>
                    <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_SE6">Shiina</persName> that we hope soon to be
                        able to be in a position to negotiate on civil aviation. I pointed out that
                        US policy makers have been much preoccupied with serious problems such as
                        the Dominican Republic, but I hoped we would be able to start negotiations
                        soon. I also said I hoped Hasegawa and his colleagues had not taken offense,
                        but we for our part thought it would be in our common interest if Hasegawa's
                        visit were postponed.</p>

                    <p>Begin verbatim text.</p>
                    <p>“Charges have recently been made in the United States against the Japanese
                        salmon fishing west of 175 west longitude. Bills authorizing the President
                        of the United States to raise the tariffs on marine products imported from
                        Japan as much as 50 percent have been submitted in the Congress of the
                        United States, and certain US fishermen's unions have expressed their intent
                        to carry out boycotting of Japanese goods and picketing of Japanese ships.
                        We are greatly concerned with such situation which, if left to develop, may
                        adversely affect the overall Japan-US relationship. The position of the
                        Japanese Government on this problem is as folows: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The Japanese salmon fishery operated west of 175 west longitude is
                                in no way restricted or regulated under the present North Pacific
                                Fisheries Convention. Despite a strong dissatisfaction with the
                                present convention based on the unequitable ‘absention formula,’
                                which is unknown elsewhere in international law, Japan has
                                faithfully observed the convention for twelve years. It is beyond
                                our comprehension that in the face of this fact an attempt is being
                                made in the United States to impose further regulations on
                                Japan.</item>

                                Bay red salmon resources. This is contrary to the fact. Statistics
                                show that the Bristol Bay red Salmon resources are on a rising
                                trend.</item>

                                the Ambassador replied at that time, the Japanese salmon fishery
                                west of 175 west longitude is neither a violation of the present
                                convention or depleting the resources, and therefore we cannot

                    <p>After the FonMin had read from the foregoing talking paper, <persName
                            corresp="#p_YT1">Yasukawa</persName> Director of the American Affairs
                        Bureau brought out a chart of the Bristol Bay red Salmon run, 1946–65.
                            <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yasukawa</persName> pointed out that Japanese
                        catch rises and falls in proportion to total run. Forecasts of the run, he
                        said, were difficult but experts seemed to be agreed that this year's run
                        will be high. Therefore, he said, one might expect that the Japanese catch
                        will increase somewhat over last year. However, Japanese fishing industry
                        would be fishing over whole area of north Pacific west of 175 west and would
                        not wish to concentrate too heavily near 175 west line for fear of missing
                        fish of Asian origin. (<persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yasukawa</persName> made
                        this point twice.)</p>
                    <p>I referred to and reiterated some of the arguments I made during the meetings
                        in Tokyo in February. We believe, I said, that the Salmon resources are the
                        result of our own conservation policies. There have now been three bad years
                        for the Salmon canneries and there is the danger that this year will also be
                        a poor one. There are strong feelings about this in the US. I said that a
                        good year is needed to recoup previous losses and in order to create a
                        favorable atmosphere in which negotiations on the north Pacific fisheries
                        convention can be resumed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It seems possible that <persName

                    <p>We have agreed with the Japanese Government to enter again, after various
                        failures since 1961, into negotiations on aviation. The critical issue is
                        the Japanese desire for a route to New York and beyond to Europe. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> is anxious to begin at least
                        informal talks, if not negotiations, before the U.S.-Japanese Cabinet
                        meeting beginning July 12.</p>
                    <p>The Civil Aeronautics Board and State are in agreement on a negotiation
                        package, which includes a route for Japan to New York and “beyond,” but
                        disagree on one condition—namely that Japan must give up her existing
                        service to either Los Angeles or San Francisco. State feels this is
                        unrealistic: Japan has served both cities for several years; there never has
                        been a case in which the United States has insisted on the discontinuance of
                        actually functioning air service, nor is it in our interest to establish
                        such a precedent. Furthermore, the Governor and other political figures in
                        California strongly oppose such a discontinuation. Finally, the Department
                        does not believe that the cancellation of Japan's rights at one California
                        point is necessary for preserving an economic balance in the Agreement.</p>
                    <p>There are other equally important considerations which we would like to bring
                        to your attention.</p>

                            <p>The United States has vital aviation interests in Japan. Tokyo is the
                                keystone of the entire Pacific networks of both Northwest and Pan
                                American and of Pan American's round-the-world service. Not only is
                                Tokyo the largest traffic point in the Far East but also the
                                “beyond” rights through Tokyo to the rest of the area are vital to

                            <p>Looking ahead a little, we cannot expect to preserve indefinitely our
                                own world-wide network of air service based, as it is, on an
                                elaborate structure of “beyond” rights, if we indefinitely frustrate
                                the demands of friendly major foreign countries for corresponding
                                rights through the United States.</p>

                        <item>The aviation issue has become politically very important in Japan and
                            we should consider in this connection the favorable posture of the
                            Japanese Government in major policy areas.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Since taking office, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> has given resolute support to United States policy
                        towards Viet Nam. He understands and collaborates in pursuit of our policies
                        towards recognition and United Nations membership for Communist China,
                        respect of the rights of the Republic of China, accelerated economic
                        development of Taiwan and South Korea, economic aid to South and Southeast
                        Asia, and supports us in policy disputes in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>, in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and in the <gloss
                            target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>We rely upon his help in forestalling challenges by inflamed elements in the
                        Japanese public to the vital United States rights in the Ryukyus and under
                        the Mutual Security Treaty. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> is now the target of an increasingly violent attack
                        both by the Socialists and even by some members of his own party for his
                        “subservience” to Washington. He is criticized for his acquiescence in
                        United States bombing of North Viet Nam, and his failure to obtain from
                        Washington improvement in such matters as the United States-Japanese
                        agreements on fish and aviation. In the face of vociferous demands that
                        Japan denounce both agreements the government has counselled patience. To
                        continue to do so without demonstrable United States understanding of
                        Japan's interests could cost Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> his office. Upper House elections are scheduled for
                        July.</p>
                    <p>Granting Japan a route to and beyond New York appears essential for an
                        agreement. Failure to do that would probably result either in severe
                        restrictions on our carriers now operating to Japan or in Japan's denouncing
                        the agreement. Our insistence on Japan's giving up existing rights to a
                        California point is not only unrealistic for the reasons mentioned
                        previously but would be considered by Japan a political affront in view of
                        their belief that the present aviation agreement is an inequitable vestige
                        of the post-war “occupation mentality.”</p>
                    <p>The proposed U.S. position is shown in detail in the enclosure. The United
                        States would receive certain new rights and reaffirmation and clarification
                        of other rights in regard to a route to Osaka, designation of additional
                        American carriers, “beyond” rights to the Asiatic Mainland and to the USSR
                        which are not vital now but are potentially crucial, acceptance of United
                        States liberal principles on <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0132"
                        />capacity, freedom of charter operations and other concessions of less
                        significance. In addition, we would demand that Japan give up its presently
                        unused rights.</p>
                    <p>The United States airline industry has conflicting views on this matter but
                        is generally opposed to the offer recommended here. Northwest would
                        vehemently oppose a North Pacific (polar) route to New York but does not
                        seriously oppose the suggested mid-Pacific route. Pan American does not
                        oppose a route to New York per se for JAL but naturally opposes the
                        competitive mid-Pacific route and rights beyond New York. The
                        transcontinental airlines, particularly American Airlines, object to the
                        grant of transcontinental rights to Japan or other countries on the ground
                        that it will divert traffic.</p>
                    <p>Available data and experience do not support assertions that the grants here
                        proposed would seriously affect U.S. domestic carriers. For example, Japan
                        Air Lines states it will offer only three flights per week between Los
                        Angeles/San Francisco and New York, compared with some 200 nonstop flights
                        alone in each direction offered by the United States transcontinental
                        airlines. Nor do we believe that the present route grant would, in itself,
                        establish any precedent leading to similar grants to other countries.</p>
                    <p>Looking broadly at our international aviation problems, we are increasingly
                        concerned by the need to examine the claims of U.S. international carriers
                        for more extensive rights within the United States on the one hand and on
                        the other the desires of some U.S. domestic carriers to have trans-Atlantic
                        or trans-Pacific rights. Not only would this result in increasing United
                        States air traffic and make for a more efficient United States air industry
                        but this expansionist policy would make more acceptable to our airlines the
                        need to grant transcontinental and “beyond” concessions to Japan and perhaps
                        ultimately to other friendly major aviation countries.</p>

                    <p>I had long private talk with <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> on 14th with view to getting his
                        personal evaluation of how Japanese public reaction to expanded Vietnam war
                        has affected various aspects of U.S.-Japanese <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98"
                            facs="0134"/>relationship. I wished to get this reading before I
                        returned to Washington July 1 and felt I should take it before <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> became too deeply involved in current
                        election campaign leading up to upper house election on July 4.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he was disturbed over
                        strength of reaction of left and intellectual community to Vietnam and felt
                        that both U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> must do better in
                        public relations, but only specific suggestion he had was that we should
                        invite more newsmen and writers to see conditions in South Vietnam
                        themselves. (He mentioned plans of former <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1"
                            >PriMin</gloss> Kishi and others along these lines.) He assured me that
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> remained firm in its commitment to
                        support U.S. on Vietnam and reminded me that he had told President <persName
                            corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> in January that U.S. would have to
                        have patience and determination since war in Vietnam was sure to be long
                        one.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s attitude however seemed to me
                        basically cautious and negative. He said that he had received enthusiatic
                        response from crowds when he had stressed in electioneering talks over
                        weekend fact that Vietnam war was far away and that there was no danger that
                        Japan would get involved. I gathered that his campaign strategy in meeting
                        leftist attack is to disassociate Japan as much as possible from the
                        war.</p>
                    <p>He also made it clear that until he knew what election results were he could
                        not judge just what effect Vietnam had had on political situation in Japan.
                        Regarding Japan's own defense posture, he mentioned increasing budgetary
                        problems which would continue to limit defense expenditures but said that he
                        felt <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Matsuno</persName>, new Director of Defense
                        Agency, was able young [garble] who would turn in good performance. (At 48
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Matsuno</persName> is youngest member of new
                        cabinet.) When I inquired about Japan's role in economic development of SE
                        Asia, <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> replied that serious
                        economic readjustments were necessary in Japan because if <persName
                            corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>'s misguided policies in past and Japan
                        was not in position for greatly increased economic role abroad.</p>
                    <p>Only really positive note was <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s
                        off-hand suggestion that sometime after elections it might be well for him
                        to “hop over to Washington” for informal talks. If elections come out well
                        for <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and his confidence as result
                        is somewhat restored, such a visit might indeed be useful in helping get
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> back on road toward more positive
                        role in Far East. We shall have to wait however until election results are
                        in and their meaning has been fully digested before we can tell if we should
                        try to push ahead to deepen U.S.-Japan relationship or should batten down
                        hatches until Vietnam storm lets up a bit.</p>

                        prompt and vigorous support for U.S.-Viet-Nam policy, notwithstanding
                        widespread Japanese public condemnation of U.S. bombing of the North. The
                        Japanese Government was more forthcoming than any other in responding to
                        your Johns Hopkins Southeast Asia proposals.<note n="3" xml:id="d53fn3">In
                            his address at Johns Hopkins University, “Peace Without Conquest,” April
                            7, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> reiterated
                            the U.S. commitment to continue to fight in Vietnam and to seek peace
                            simultaneously. Realizing that a peaceful end to the conflict was not
                            yet in sight, <persName>Johnson</persName> called for cooperative
                            efforts among the countries of Southeast Asia to &gt;develop the region.
                            The President intended to ask Congress to support “a billion dollar
                            American investment in the effort” and urged other industrialized
                            nations to join as well. <persName>Johnson</persName> proposed
                            developing the Mekong River Valley, providing modern medical care to the

                        economic development in the area. On the other hand, Japan is reluctant to
                        become involved in support of the military aspects of U.S. policy in
                        Viet-Nam.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Japanese have been informed of your civil aviation offer. Japan's desire
                        for round-the-world rights is strong. The Japanese hoped to get it without
                        substantial loss in Japan's present rights and without making
                        concessions.</p>
                    <p>I have made it clear to the Foreign Minister that there is no significant
                        room for haggling over detail. Notwithstanding some anxiety over the
                        expectation that rights they grant us may expose them to new, different, and
                        possibly heavy competition in the near future, Japan may agree to our
                        proposals for a new civil aviation agreement between our two countries.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The overwhelming impression made by our discussions on trade and economic
                        matters has been one of vitality of the two economies, harmony of interest
                        in the context of world economic trends, and success in dealing with common
                        problems. The Japanese are putting on record their dissatisfaction with
                        various protectionist features in the handling of our economy, particularly
                        the buy-America Saylor Amendment and informal pressures we are putting on
                        them with respect to exports to the United States, e.g. woolen textiles. We
                        have expressed sharp dissatisfaction with Japan's treatment of Americans
                        desiring to make direct investment in Japan, reviewed with them their
                        protectionist policies and discussed the wisdom of Japan's showing some
                        restraint in hitting the American market too hard in narrow vulnerable
                        sectors. Our give and take on these matters has been constructive.</p>

                    <p>To generalize, the Cabinet sessions this year reveal a readiness of the two
                        countries to proceed from focus upon bilateral problems to mutual
                        consideration of joint and multilateral opportunities for improving the
                        world economic community, i.e. by examination of the liquidity problem and
                        mobilizing increased aid resources for the less developed countries.</p>

                    <p>It is obviously of vital importance to the United States that the
                        relationship with Japan be maintained and strengthened so that (a) the <pb
                            n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0141"/>Japanese industrial potential does
                        not drift to the Communist side or into a position of neutrality, (b) our
                        bases in Japan and the Ryukyus and Japan's industrial back-up facilities
                        continue to contribute to the defenses of the Far East, and (c) Japan plays
                        a growing role in the economic development of the free countries of East and
                        South Asia and eventually contributes to their political stability and
                        security. It seems equally obvious that it is in Japan's economic and
                        security interests to maintain a close relationship with us and to
                        contribute to the stability and economic development of the free nations of
                        Asia.</p>
                    <p>This is realized by the leadership of the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party,
                        but the relationship with us and Japan's contribution to the free countries
                        of Asia have hitherto been limited by the violent opposition of determined
                        Communist and fellow-traveler elements, by a strong Marxist tinge to all
                        Japanese intellectual life, and by prevailing tendencies toward pacifism,
                        neutralism and isolationism, resulting from Japan's bitter experiences in
                        the Second World War. Over the years there has been a slow but steady growth
                        in the voting strength of the Left and a corresponding erosion of the
                        position of the Liberal-Democratic Party. The Left has counted on this to
                        bring them in time to political power and has aimed specifically at 1970
                        (the first year that the United States-Japan Security Treaty can be
                        denounced by either side) as the time to break Japan's defense relationship
                        with the United States. The Left has also counted on mounting nationalistic
                        concern over the American administration of the Ryukyus as a major weapon
                        with which to attack the ruling party and break the special Japanese
                        relationship with the United States.</p>
                    <p>Basic trends over the past few years, however, have indicated that the Left
                        would probably be frustrated in these intentions. Galloping economic growth,
                        relaxing political tensions, growing understanding of the realities of the
                        world situation, and declining confidence in the validity of Marxist dogma
                        all have served to stem the erosion of the position of the
                        Liberal-Democratic Party and to strengthen the relationship with the United
                        States. Until this past January it appeared that these favorable trends
                        would have so progressed by 1970 that the threat of the Left would have
                        faded and the problem of the Ryukyus could be held to managable levels until
                        public opinion in Japan was ready for a fuller military alliance with the
                        United States that would obviate the necessity for the special status of the
                        Ryukyus. It therefore seemed a safe policy for the United States to drift
                        with the favorable currents, encouraging their flow to the extent that this
                        could be done without running the risk of stirring up counter currents.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The violent popular reaction in Japan since January to the Vietnamese
                        situation has invalidated these earlier optimistic estimates. <pb n="106"
                            xml:id="pg_106" facs="0142"/>Even conservatives in Japan are much
                        worried about the possibility of a major U.S. defeat in Southeast Asia and
                        many of them entertain serious doubts about the wisdom of American policies.
                        The general public has tended to be strongly critical of American policies
                        in Viet-Nam and as a result has become much less friendly toward the United
                        States than before. The extreme left, encouraged by this general atmosphere,
                        has returned to the attack on the American-Japanese relationship with
                        renewed rigor. The favorable trends of preceding years were reversed between
                        February and May of this year, and considerable ground was lost in
                        U.S.-Japan relations. Since then the ebb tide seems to have been at least
                        temporarily stemmed, but we cannot expect a restoration of the earlier
                        favorable currents so long as the Viet-Nam situation remains unsettled, and
                        a worsening of the situation (either through a major escalation of the risks
                        of an expanded war or through a serious deterioration of the U.S. position)
                        would unquestionably mean a further loss of valuable ground.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances we can no longer count on favorable long-term
                        trends making the U.S.-Japan relationship fully secure by 1970. Nor can we
                        assume that the Ryukyu problem will remain manageable even that long.<note

                            was more worrisome to him than before,” and expressed his view that the
                            U.S.-Okinawa relationship “cannot be held on present terms for more than
                            two years.” (Memorandum of conversation, July 16; National Archives and

                        vulnerable point in the U.S.-Japanese relationship, since it brings together
                        the rapidly rising nationalistic feelings of conservative Japanese with the
                        anti-Americanism of the Left. The conservative government recognizes the
                        importance of our Ryukyu bases for the defense of Japan and the stability of
                        the Far East, but if it finds cooperation with us over the Ryukyus too great
                        a liability in domestic politics, it may place the party's political
                        interests over Japan's defense needs. Without the full cooperation of the
                        Japanese Government, the U.S. position in the Ryukyus would probably become
                        untenable, not so much because of local unrest, which probably would be
                        severe, as because of the international repercussions if Japan were to refer
                        the problem to the United Nations or some other international forum. A
                        U.S.-Japan confrontation over the Ryukyus would do incalculable damage to
                        all other aspects of our relationship.</p>

                    <p>Our basic strategy of riding passively with the favorable currents in our
                        relations with Japan is no longer valid, since these currents have <pb
                            n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0143"/>weakened or even reversed
                        themselves and time is beginning to run out. We need to move forward with
                        the Japanese to a new relationship which will be viable for a longer period
                        of time. Such a new relationship would have to be based squarely on a
                        recognition of resurgent Japanese nationalism, which makes the Japanese
                        public and government increasingly desirous of a more positive role in
                        international affairs and less willing to tolerate any affront to Japanese
                        national consciousness, such as is inherent in American administrative
                        control over the 900,000 Japanese inhabitants of the Ryukyus.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese Government and the Liberal-Democratic Party are likely to prove
                        responsive to an effort on our part to move ahead to a new relationship.
                        They have witnessed a further erosion of their position this past spring and
                        may feel that they cannot afford much longer to remain passively on the
                        defensive against the renewed attacks of the Left on foreign policy.
                        Hitherto in times of crisis they have sought to minimize their losses by
                        remaining as aloof as possible both from the crisis itself and from the
                        American role in the crisis. But such a policy does no more than slow down
                        the rate of loss of popular support for the party in power. The government
                        may be beginning to realize that the resurgence of nationalistic feeling in
                        the past few years and growing public awareness of the realities of
                        international politics now make possible a more positive and successful
                        answer to the attacks of the Left. A larger and more prominent role in the
                        Free World alliance, particularly if coupled with the elimination of slights
                        to Japanese nationalistic sentiments, could give the Liberal Democratic
                        Party much sounder political footing in its fight with the Left than does
                        its present half-hearted alliance with us and its timid participation in
                        Free World strategy.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Three things are needed if we are to develop this new relationship with
                        Japan: <list>

                            <item>We must take whatever steps we can to lessen present friction with
                                Japan and thus give ourselves further time to work out this sounder
                                new relationship. For this purpose we should pay particular
                                attention to the following points: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>Insofar as possible, we should take Japanese reactions
                                        into consideration in determining our policies in Viet-Nam.
                                        For example, we should not forget that the bombing of
                                        civilian populations would produce particularly adverse
                                        reactions in Japan, whereas our emphasis on negotiations and
                                        our willingness to accept a multi-national solution have
                                        desirable effects. In particular, it would be helpful if
                                        Japan itself could somehow be involved in any international
                                        decisions on Viet-Nam.</item>

                                    <label>4.</label>
                                    <item>We should minimize irritations over the Ryukyus by
                                        continuing the present policy if increasing local autonomy
                                        and by greatly expanding economic aid to the islands. If the
                                        Ryukyus were a Japanese prefecture, they would be receiving
                                        as aid from the central government something like
                                        $50,000,000 over and above the taxes paid to the central
                                        government. Combined aid from the United States and Japan at
                                        present amounts to less than half of this sum. As a result,
                                        educational and social security standards in the Ryukyus
                                        fall well below those of Japan. A joint United States-Japan
                                        effort to make up this deficiency is imperative. The
                                        Japanese Government appears ready to provide its share of
                                        the expanded aid program, but, for the United States to
                                        provide its part, it will be necessary to revise the
                                        so-called Price Amendment, which limits the United States
                                        aid figure to $12,000,000.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3"

                                            Ryukyus and believed an appropriation of $25 million
                                            would suffice for the time being. <persName

                                            The Department of the Army took the initiative in early
                                            1966 to prepare for Congressional hearings on increasing
                                            the support limit contained in the Price Act (Public Law
                                            86–629), which provided for economic and social

                                        fields. In other words, we might give thought to encouraging

                                        with Communist China. In particular we should encourage
                                        Japan to take a leading political role in behalf of the free

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Bob:</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>, the Joint Staff, and our FE Bureau have
                        been wrestling yesterday and today with the question of an appropriate
                        message to <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> or <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE6">Shiina</persName> as to our future plans for the use of
                        Okinawa in B–52 strikes in Viet-Nam. As you know, our use of the Okinawa
                        bases for this <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0148"/>purpose is
                        theoretically unlimited, and we do not have a formal obligation even to
                        consult or notify the Japanese. Nonetheless, in the wake of this week's
                        strike and its publicity, we have felt that some form of discussion was
                        required as a matter of courtesy.</p>
                    <p>Upon reflection, it now seems to me that the issue runs very much deeper than
                        the immediate issue of what we say to the Japanese. The real question is how
                        much we in fact need to use the Okinawa bases in the next few months for
                        strikes. (I should say that I leave to one side the question of the use of
                        Okinawa for tanker operations, which would not be likely to lead to
                        publicity and which we believe can continue in any event.)</p>
                    <p>In our judgment, recurrent use of the Okinawa bases, as a practical political
                        matter, will seriously heighten pressures in Japan on the issue of Okinawa
                        generally, and indeed will significantly affect the whole atmosphere of our
                        relations with Japan in every sphere. I do not think these results would
                        necessarily follow if our use of Okinawa were really confined to
                        emergency-type situations, such as the typhoon relocation that occasioned
                        this week's strike, but I do believe that we must take a very hard look
                        indeed before we get into a situation where the use of Okinawa would in fact
                        be frequent.</p>
                    <p>I base these conclusions not only on the Japanese reaction to this week's
                        strike and the Embassy's reports (which I believe are available to
                            you),<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">Embassy telegrams discussing this issue

                        recent visit here.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> was in Washington to
                            attend the Fourth Meeting of the U.S.-Japan Committee on Trade and
                            Economic Affairs held July 12–14.</note> The plain fact is that, despite
                        the absolutely first-rate performance of General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WMGAII1">Watson</persName> and the presently quiescent state
                        of specific frictions over Okinawa, Japanese feeling on the issue runs very
                        deep indeed, and it is <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName>'s
                        judgment—which we share—that, even without the issue being further aroused,
                        we face a situation where Japan may demand basic changes in our structure
                        and rights in Okinawa within the next two–three years. If we act in such a
                        way as to arouse Japanese feeling markedly, this period may be greatly
                        shortened, and—to repeat—the whole atmosphere of our relationship, already
                        under stress because of differing Japanese popular views on Viet-Nam, would
                        be seriously affected.</p>
                    <p>In other words, we have to weigh the importance of Okinawa for strikes
                        against Viet-Nam not only against major political factors but against
                        over-all possibilities which could drastically affect the future usefulness
                        of Okinawa from a military standpoint.</p>
                    <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0149"/>
                    <p>All these factors lead me to suggest that you review this matter urgently
                        with the Joint Chiefs, and that we consider it thereafter, at the highest
                        State and Defense levels, with the clear possibility that we shall have to
                        bring it to the President. If participation from State will be helpful to

                        <p rend="center">JAPANESE DEFENSE POLICY</p>
                        <p>1. It has been the U.S. official as well as public view since soon after
                            the Korean War that the Japanese forces buildup has been too limited and
                            too slow; that the U.S. should seek to persuade the Japanese to
                            accelerate the development of more modern and larger forces for more
                            complete and effective home defense and the assumption by Japan of its
                            proper share of regional security responsibilities; and that with the
                            growth of national pride and ambition the Japanese would probably
                            themselves increasingly desire larger forces and a more active military
                            role.</p>
                        <p>2. The Japanese defense forces have developed steadily in recent years
                            but remain very small in comparison with those of other major powers.
                            Reawakening Japanese national pride and desire for international status
                            appear not to have significantly increased Japanese interest in larger
                            forces or a Japanese overseas military role. If U.S. policies toward
                            Japan's defense effort have been sound, they have at the least been of
                            limited effectiveness. Perhaps the policies themselves have been too
                            much based on longstanding habits of thought within the U.S. Government,
                            resentment over the small proportion of GNP increasingly prosperous
                            Japan devotes to the common defense, and desire to sell military
                            equipment to Japan. A new look at the matter seems in order as the
                            requirements of the Southeast Asian situation mount and the <pb n="115"
                                xml:id="pg_115" facs="0151"/>date when the U.S. and Japan must
                            reconfirm, alter or terminate their Security Treaty relationship
                            approaches.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here are sections A. “Buildup of Japanese Home Defense Forces”
                            and B. “Adequacy of Japanese Forces in the Face of Current and
                            Prospective Threats.”]</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>12. These continue to be mainly governed by (a) lingering antimilitary
                            sentiments growing out of Japan's disastrous war experiences; (b) doubt
                            of the practical value of large Japanese forces—in view of the lack of
                            any clear threat to Japanese territory, U.S. treaty commitments to
                            Japan, and the desire to build friendly relations with neighboring,
                            formerly occupied countries; and (c) reluctance to accept the cost of
                            sizeable forces. With the passage of time, initial suspicion and
                            disapproval of the small, slowly growing Self-Defense Forces has given
                            way to acquiescence and grudging approval but little active pride or
                            enthusiasm.</p>
                        <p>13. For some time it has been expected that growing national
                            consciousness and desire for international status would render the
                            Japanese increasingly reluctant to rely on the U.S. for their security,
                            and more disposed to build up their own forces. It is becoming
                            increasingly clear that this is not happening. The <gloss
                                target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1965–66 defense budget, submitted by
                            the reputedly more defense-minded <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> and approved last March by the Diet, barely covers
                            rising costs of the existing establishment, with minimum amounts for
                            force improvement, as in <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1965 and
                            1964. While there is evidence that anti-military sentiments are
                            continuing gradually to decline, there appears to be no greater
                            disposition than in the past to replace or supplement the U.S. deterrent
                            with expanded Japanese forces. Public attention remains firmly fixed on
                            economic gains. Developing national pride has led to increased demands
                            for “independent” Japanese foreign policies, but neither this desired
                            independence, the mounting scale of Communist aggression in Viet-Nam or
                            the deteriorating situation in Indonesia has significantly altered
                            Japanese defense policy, which remains basically unchanged from the
                            Fifties.</p>
                        <p>14. The <gloss target="#t_CCNE1">CCNE</gloss>s have had limited impact in
                            Japan, long accustomed to the nuclear weapons of its traditional enemy,
                            the USSR. Some Japanese have been influenced by them to favor an
                            expanded Japanese defense effort including nuclear weapons. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> has privately expressed such views
                            and the <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1966–67 defense budget, the
                            first prepared by a cabinet of <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName>'s own choosing, may noticeably reflect them. But
                            the general reaction has been largely undisturbed, with no disposition
                            to turn from butter to guns. With their strong cultural affinity for
                            Mainland China; knowing that for better or worse Mainland China's <pb
                                n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0152"/>vast population will be only a
                            few hundred miles away forever; doubting that Peking, whatever its
                            political ambitions, intends to attack Japan; and hoping still that
                            Japan can some day play a leading role in the development of Mainland
                            China, most Japanese are determined to avoid the development of a
                            confirmedly hostile attitude between Japan and China. A picture of China
                            and Japan pointing nuclear missiles at each other, against which neither
                            (but especially confined Japan) could effectively defend, has no appeal.
                            This attitude could change as the <gloss target="#t_CHICOM1"
                                >Chicom</gloss> nuclear capability and Japanese nationalism grow;
                            but the prospect now appears to be continuing efforts to preserve a
                            tolerable, hopefully cooperative relation with Communist China, under
                            the U.S. nuclear umbrella, not to build up forces against it.</p>
                        <p>15. Elements in the U.S. may at some time question the wisdom of
                            maintaining U.S. defense commitments to a Japan which refuses to view
                            the <gloss target="#t_CHICOM1">Chicom</gloss> aggressive threat in the
                            terms we do. If Japan, even while continuing to withhold diplomatic
                            recognition, persists in seeking friendly, productive relations with a
                            Communist China which has become even more hostile toward the U.S. than
                            at present, a situation could develop comparable to the one we now face
                            with Pakistan, whose rapprochement with Communist China is leading an
                            increasing number of Americans to question our continued defense
                            commitments to Pakistan. This danger is receiving and should continue to
                            receive close U.S. and Japanese Governmental attention.</p>

                        <p>16. The success Japan has achieved in its concentration on economic
                            growth and improved living standards has been a major Free World gain,
                            both for the proof it has provided of the workability of free political
                            and economic institutions in an Asian environment and the contribution a
                            burgeoning Japan has made to Free World economic strength. Continued
                            conservative, strongly Free World oriented leadership in Japan depends
                            on the maintenance of a high growth rate and rising living standards,
                            including costly improvement of public services (roads, parks, harbors,
                            sanitation, etc.), neglected for decades. A substantially larger
                            Japanese defense effort would divert resources from such politically
                            important Japanese domestic programs and overseas (mainly <gloss
                                target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>) non-military aid, both directly in
                            U.S. interest.</p>
                        <p>17. With Japan's defense effort only 1.1% of GNP, even doubling of that
                            proportionate effort would leave substantial resources for these
                            purposes. But as long as Japanese public attitudes on defense policy
                            remain essentially as at present, any government which proposed a sharp
                            expansion of defense expenditures would risk its early replacement, in
                            all probability by a more neutralist government less likely to ensure
                            Japan's continued, effective Free World alignment. U.S. interest in
                            Japan's remaining an active political and economic Free World <pb
                                n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0153"/>associate is far greater than
                            our interest in the contribution expanded Japanese forces might make to
                            Free World military strength. And while Japan's peaceful postwar
                            regeneration appears genuine and deep-rooted, we cannot exclude the
                            possibility that we would live to regret the re-establishment of
                            powerful Japanese forces at home and overseas. It is too early to
                            conclude that a nation which has glorified war to the extent Japan has
                            will not turn in that direction again. Nor should we overlook the fact
                            that, seeking the most efficient and economic means to achieve powerful
                            forces, a growing number of Japanese might be tempted by the nuclear
                            route.</p>

                            the greatest threat to Japan, and thus to U.S. interests in Japan, is
                            not that of military attack by any nation but of a deterioration in the
                            general climate of security and economic wellbeing in the Far East which
                            would leave Japan more and more isolated in a hostile environment,
                            strike at its trade with other Far Eastern nations, and threaten its
                            trade routes with the rest of the world. Faced by this threat, and
                            considering the political obstacles at home and abroad to a much
                            expanded Japanese military effort, Japan's major contribution to Free
                            World security would appear to lie in the economic area, with U.S.
                            influence directed not to acceleration of the Japanese defense buildup
                            but to expansion of Japanese South and Southeast Asian economic aid and
                            investment. As the Japanese become more involved economically with other
                            Far Eastern nations they will tend to become more involved politically,
                            which could lead in time to defense involvement as well. But that must
                            develop spontaneously. There is little evidence that absence of U.S.
                            pressure would significantly reduce the pace of the Japanese defense
                            buildup, which over the years has proceeded at its own rate, influenced
                            much more by domestic Japanese political considerations than by our
                            urgings. The fact that our pressure is likely to become less rather than
                            more effective as Japanese national independence and self-determination
                            grow is added reason for not attempting to exert it.</p>
                        <p>19. There is another reason why we should consider carefully before
                            pressing the Japanese to accelerate their defense effort. It may not be
                            in our interest that the Japanese become exclusively and completely
                            responsible for home defense, leaving the U.S. with no defense role in
                            Japan. Retention of a real defense role for our Japan-based forces is
                            important in justifying the U.S.-Japan security relationship to Japanese
                            skeptics, in maintaining the credibility of our strategic commitment to
                                <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0154"/>Japan, in providing cover

                        <p>20. Finally, we should stop judging the adequacy of the Japanese defense
                            effort by the proportion it represents of GNP. This standard has no
                            military validity; the adequacy of a defense establishment should be
                            judged against the threat which it is meant to counter, not against the
                            percentage of income applied to it. Moreover, the percentage of GNP
                            standard does not have the significance in Japan which it might in a
                            country with a relatively static GNP. Although the percentage of GNP
                            devoted by Japan to defense has not gone up in recent years, the defense
                            budget rose between <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1961 and <gloss
                                target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1965 from $510 million to $860 million.
                            This sizeable increase should not be downgraded because the economy grew
                            during the period at so rapid a rate.</p>
                        <p>21. Looking objectively at our fundamental interests respecting Japan in
                            the late Sixties and early Seventies one might arrive at the following

                            remainder of the decade would seem to be high-quality air and naval
                            units, of approximately the present total size, to deter or repel
                            probing incursions or limited blockade or attack, supported by ground
                            forces clearly inadequate for defense against major attack but capable
                            of ensuring internal security, including the security of U.S. bases, and
                            of serving as a basis for possible later expansion for an overseas role.
                            This pattern would involve acceptance of current low army manning levels
                            (140,000) and assignment of any resources thus saved to modernization of
                            the ground forces, modernization and possible expansion of the air and
                            maritime forces, and formation of organized reserves, <pb n="119"
                                xml:id="pg_119" facs="0155"/>now completely lacking. The objective
                            would be Japanese forces able to deal decisively by themselves with
                            minor encroachments or attacks; clearly dependent on U.S. forces to
                            deter major attack; and capable of eventual expansion for overseas
                            service, if and as political attitudes in Japan and abroad alter to
                            permit this, almost certainly not before the next decade.</p>
                        <p>23. Such forces might include units trained for <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> peacekeeping operations, the most promising initial form
                            of Japanese overseas military activity. Japan has military attachés
                            abroad, and the Japanese Government might even now be prepared to place
                            at the Secretary General's disposal such attachés located near trouble
                            areas. This might provide the opening for dispatch, possibly as early as
                            1967 or 1968, of small Japanese forces to police boundaries and perform
                            other peacekeeping functions but not, for an indefinite period ahead, to
                            join with other Free World forces in anti-Communist, Viet-Nam-type
                            combat operations.<note n="5" xml:id="d58fn5">As the Embassy pointed out
                                in its letter to <persName corresp="#p_FRA3">Fearey</persName> of
                                June 9, there appeared little or no possibility of military use of
                                Japanese troops in the foreseeable future. Not only was extensive
                                legislation needed before Japanese troops participated in any
                                military actions, but also “the members of the Self Defense Forces
                                serve only under a contractual arrangement, and there is no legal
                                way for officers to compel their men to fight; the spectre of
                                Japanese troops politely refusing to go into battle, and turning in
                                their resignations instead, would be too much for the government to
                                risk!” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>24. Due primarily to the attractions of industrial employment and the
                            dwindling farm population (the traditional source of army manpower), the
                            number of applicants for the GSDF fell, despite aggressive recruitment
                            efforts, to 89,000 in 1963 and 69,000 in 1964, compared with 150,000 in
                            1962 and an average of 200,000 over the preceding 10 years. Because of
                            this shortfall, actual GSDF strength has remained over the past three
                            years at about 85% of authorized strength—140,000 instead of the
                            authorized 171,000. While the GSDF continues normally to consist of 13
                            divisions, some divisions are at only 50–60% of strength; available
                            manpower is sufficient for only 9 full-strength divisions. Conscription,
                            or even withdrawal of the right of all Japanese servicemen to leave the
                            forces any time they wish, including time of prospective or actual
                            combat, is politically infeasible.</p>
                        <p>25. A Japanese Government decision to stabilize the GSDF at 140,000, or
                            even a Japanese initiative to reduce it to 130,000 or 120,000 to achieve
                            better balanced overall forces against the threats facing Japan, would
                            therefore be a less radical change than might at first appear. Since
                            nearly 80% of GSDF funds go for personnel expenditures, reduction to
                            130,000 or 120,000 would free substantial resources for army equipment
                            modernization and diversion to the air and maritime forces, assuming
                            that the Government did not divert the resources to <pb n="120"
                                xml:id="pg_120" facs="0156"/>other purposes. It is pertinent to note
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, admittedly possessing a far

                            only 80,000 troops in the British homeland—though another 47,000 on the
                            continent of course contribute, with other <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> forces, to British home defense. And not to be
                            forgotten is the economic contribution which released GSDF personnel
                            could make to the Japanese economy, key sectors of which are suffering
                            labor shortages.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>26. a) The experience of recent years, during which a substantial revival
                            of Japanese national feeling and the <gloss target="#t_CCNE1"
                                >CCNE</gloss>s have occurred without significantly altering Japanese
                            public attitudes on defense questions, indicates that Japan will not
                            greatly expand its home defense forces during the remainder of the
                            decade but will continue gradually to improve their qualitative capacity
                            to deter and repel hostile incursions and limited blockade or
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>b) The U.S. should continue to support such improvement. It should also
                            continue to encourage Japan to rely on the U.S. deterrent for security
                            against major attack. Additionally, it should make clear to the Japanese
                            Government that although we remain ready and anxious to sell military
                            equipment to Japan, and to consult with and advise the Japanese
                            Government on defense planning questions, we consider the size and
                            composition of Japanese forces a matter for Japanese decision free of
                            any form of U.S. pressure.</p>
                        <p>c) Japanese public attitudes, combined with continuing fear abroad of a
                            revived Japanese militarism, will continue at least into the early
                            Seventies to prevent a Japanese forces contribution in Southeast Asia,
                            Korea or the Taiwan Straits. These attitudes will alter only through the
                            force of events and through political maturation in Japan and abroad.
                            The U.S. should seek discreetly to foster this political maturation,
                            recognizing that U.S. pressure, as opposed to free exchanges of
                            information, views and experience, will slow rather than hasten the
                            process. Japanese contributions to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            peacekeeping operations may become feasible within two or three

                                determine whether Japan would embark “quietly without public

                            is to pro-reversion demonstrations on the first day of <persName

                            demonstrations resulted in often violent confrontations between
                            participants and local police.</note> however, threw spotlight
                        specifically on reversion question in manner which makes it impossible for
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> either to sweep it back under rug or
                        to leave it for opposition to exploit. This is first time top leadership of
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has had personal contact with actual
                        conditions in Okinawa and preliminary indications are that <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and Cabinet believe there is need for
                        progress in Japanese positions and actions. As put by Yamano, Director
                        Special Areas Liaison Bureau, who accompanied <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName>, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has come to
                        believe that there is “gap” between desires and hopes of Okinawans for
                        reversion and actions taken so far by <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                        for economic assistance. Basic problem facing <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss>, according to Yamano, is how to fill in this gap, bearing
                        in mind <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> realization of importance of
                        Okinawa base to security of Far East and Japan, recognized difficulties
                        which stand in way of separating base rights from administrative control of
                        islands, and assumption that full reversion cannot be accomplished in near
                        future. If this gap is not bridged, he believes, opposition in Okinawa and
                        Japan will increasingly capitalize on reversion issue to detriment of
                        position of Democratic Party (DP) in Okinawa and of Liberal Democratic Party
                            (<gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>) in Japan.</p>
                    <p>2. Demonstration evening of August 19, although it was regarded in Japan as
                        regrettable impoliteness to <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss> on his
                        initial visit and although leftist instigation was generally recognized, was
                        nevertheless looked on as genuine expression of serious Okinawan wish to
                        have administrative control of their island returned to Japan as soon as
                        possible. Prior to <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> visit,
                        Japanese public had acknowledged desirability of reversion and had approved
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>'s efforts toward this ultimate
                        objective. They had not, however, appreciated extent and intensity of
                        reversion sentiment in Okinawa until it was demonstrated by attitude of <pb
                            n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0159"/>people in general as well as by
                        outburst. Moreover, emphasis by Okinawa reversion council during <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> visit on fact that Okinawa has been
                        under foreign military occupation for as long as 20 years seemed to
                        intensify Japanese appreciation of reversion sentiment and of need for
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to do something about it.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> has decided establish cabinet
                        council concerned with Okinawa. This will consist of Foreign Minister,
                        Finance Minister, Local Autonomy Minister, Agricultural-Forestry Minister,
                        Welfare Minister, Education Minister, Chief Cabinet Secretary and Director
                        General <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss>'s office. Council is to be
                        formally approved at cabinet meeting August 27 and to have first meeting
                        same day.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> feels more than ever that November
                        elections for Okinawa legislature will be crucial. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> therefore desires complete action on
                        Japanese aid for Okinawa for next year far enough before elections to permit
                        full use in election campaign. Separate message will be sent on aid as soon
                        as details are known.</p>
                    <p>5. Effect of visit to Okinawa on <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s
                        personal prestige and <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> position is also
                        important aspect. On favorable side, visit was considered by public as
                        appropriate thing for <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss> to do and
                        proper expression to people of Okinawa of homeland sympathy and interest in
                        their affairs. <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss>'s speeches and
                        general conduct of visit have met with favorable comment. Principal adverse
                        factor has been <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s decision remain
                        overnight at military guest quarters when demonstrators surrounded his
                        hotel. Preponderant feeling has been that <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1"
                            >PriMin</gloss> should have met demonstrators. In any event, his return
                        to military base has been widely criticized as lacking in political
                        astuteness. Members of his party, in radio and TV appearances, have gone to
                        great lengths to explain away situation but unfavorable attitude on this
                        point remains.</p>
                    <p>6. Present indications are that <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                        and immediate advisors are approaching Okinawa question with caution and are
                        well aware its potential seriousness. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hashimoto,
                        according press, rebuked Local Autonomy Minister Nagayane at Aug 24 cabinet
                        meeting (<persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> absent) for reportedly
                        having told press he endorsed proposal to take reversion question to United
                        Nations in search for early solution. <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1"
                            >PriMin</gloss>'s Special Assistant for Foreign Affairs Moriyuki Motono
                        Aug 24 told Emb offs that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> must adopt
                        policies on Okinawa issue which would enable it win support of “healthy”
                        nationalism in Japan and prevent opposition's monopolizing Nationalist
                        sentiment on this issue. Like Yamano (para 1 above), Motono asserted that
                        economic assistance no longer sufficient to meet <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss> domestic imperatives on Okinawa issue, and reversion
                        question could “no longer be ignored,” even though early full reversion not
                        expected. He seemed to imply that image of greater effort and some progress
                        were needed, not necessarily spectacular concrete results.</p>
                    <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0160"/>
                    <p>7. It is too early for <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to have reached
                        any conclusions on actions it may propose to fill alleged “gap” between aid
                        and reversion sentiment. We must nevertheless be prepared for <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> wish to discuss this question in terms that
                        will be meaningful to Japan.</p>

                        sound out Japanese leaders cautiously to see if they felt ready to explore
                        more deeply with us future of American-Japanese relations in hope that

                        of US-Japan relations has been stagnant or deteriorating over past few
                        months, primarily because of widespread popular criticism in Japan of US
                        actions in Vietnam and opposition to our use of bases in Japan and Ryukyus
                        for any purpose in any way connected with war in Vietnam. I made plea for
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to recognize that preventing victory
                        of Communists in SE Asia was as much in Japan's interests as US. I hoped
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would begin take public position in
                        Japan in support of US not simply on grounds Japan tied to US by security
                        treaty, but on basis Japan' own safety and need for <pb n="125"
                            xml:id="pg_125" facs="0161"/>peaceful and friendly SE Asia. I suggested
                        that we might begin serious discussions aimed at identifying Japanese and
                        American interests and determining how we could best cooperate. I also
                        carried out instruction in Deptel 516,<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">Not
                            found.</note> pointing out need for expanded economic assistance to
                        Vietnam to build up economy and care for refugees.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s reactions throughout, as in
                        other conversations since middle of last spring, were basically evasive. On
                        Vietnamese aid he indicated <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would
                        consider specific concrete proposals (such as humanitarian aid to refugees,
                        dams, electrical generating plants, etc.) when they came up but was not
                        ready at this time to discuss generalized problem of long-range assistance
                        to Vietnam. He based this position on alleged Asian inability to understand
                        economic aid to build up a country at a time when war was going on.
                        Implication was that he felt overall aid program could not be discussed
                        until it could be completely disassociated from American prosecution of war
                        in Vietnam. On subject of Japanese public opinion, <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> admitted press gave slanted view, but
                        asserted that majority of Japanese people supported us and only “Socialists
                        and Communists” opposed. He then suggested that unfavorable Japanese public
                        attitude toward US was caused by economic problems such as civil air
                        negotiations, fisheries dispute, and cotton and wool textiles. He added hope
                        US would treat Japan on same basis as Canada. (He obviously had economic
                        matters only in mind in this statement.)</p>
                    <p>4. I replied that relationship such as with Canada or perhaps more
                        appropriately as with Germany would be highly desirable, pointing out that
                        these countries gave strong governmental and public support to our mutual
                        defense needs.</p>
                    <p>5. This initial approach to <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> was
                        disappointing because he clearly wished to avoid at this time serious
                        exchange on mutual interests and security problems. From other things he has
                        been saying, I believe his thinking is that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss> over next three months faces serious political problem in
                        Diet fight over ratification of Korean treaty and therefore all other
                        problems should be soft pedaled until this safely out of way, by which time
                        he may expect Vietnam situation and state of public opinion in Japan will
                        also have improved. I would agree that any public debate of US-Japanese
                        relationship is undesirable at this time, but I feel that this should not
                        inhibit confidential exploratory conversations. Real question I believe is
                        whether <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> will be ready for serious
                        examination of problems even after ratification of treaty. I propose to
                        continue discreet soundings with leaders close to <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> and others with influence in Liberal Democratic Party
                        with a view to <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0162"/>testing how much
                        support there may be in party for more forthright stand on Japan's
                        relationship with US and its interests in Far East. My soundings might also
                        help lay groundwork for fruitful talks this winter. Message I gave at
                        Security Consultative Committee meeting was clearly understood, I am sure,
                        and <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yasukawa</persName>, Director of North

                        agree with advisability of serious talks regarding our overall relationship
                        and told us he had reported fully on <persName corresp="#p_SE3"

                    <head>61. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>In September 1965 Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                        began working behind the scenes to promote a negotiated settlement to the
                        Vietnam conflict. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> supported a
                        journey to South Vietnam and the United States by Toshikazu Kase, former
                        Japanese Ambassador to the United Nations, intended to elicit a clearer
                        picture of the United States' role in Southeast Asia. Since retiring from
                        the Japanese foreign service, Kase, a strong supporter of U.S. policy in
                        Vietnam, was active as a writer and television commentator. Accordingly, the
                        United States supported Kase's visits to Saigon and Washington based on the
                        hope that upon his return to Japan he could educate the Japanese public and
                        policy-makers about the situation in Vietnam and engender support for
                        American actions there. Kase met with Ambassador <persName>Henry
                            Cabot</persName> Lodge in Saigon and with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Assistant Secretary
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> in Washington.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, in late January 1966, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> sent Masayuki Yokoyama, a retired diplomat, on a
                        mission to several European and Asian capitals to meet with North Vietnamese
                        diplomatic representatives in an attempt to foster support for a peace
                        conference on Vietnam. Some officials of the Japanese Foreign Office as well
                        as Americans at the Embassy in Japan questioned the choice of Yokoyama as a
                        suitable representative. Already in his 70s and retired since 1941, Yokoyama
                        lacked contemporary political or diplomatic contacts and influence. Little
                        was expected and little was achieved from his endeavors.</p>
                    <p>In addition to special envoys, Japanese diplomats became involved in Vietnam
                        peace efforts. The limited contact began when the Japanese and North
                        Vietnamese ambassadors serving in Moscow began periodic, private meetings to
                        discuss the situation in Vietnam and the <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127"
                            facs="0163"/>prospects for peace. But after four meetings—in July,
                        September, and December 1966 and in January 1967—the North Vietnamese
                        Ambassador was reassigned and the talks ceased. The Japanese Ambassador
                        attempted unsuccessfully to reestablish the relationship with the new North
                        Vietnamese Ambassador in Moscow. The precedent set by the earlier meetings,
                        however, spurred Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                        to try to establish such contact elsewhere. In March 1967 he ordered
                        Japanese Embassies in locations having North Vietnamese representation to
                        attempt to open a diplomatic dialogue. On the whole, the Japanese overtures
                        proved disappointing.</p>

                        >Reischauer</persName>'s memorandum of July 14<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">
                            <ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> in which he analyzed the
                        present situation in Japan and advanced a number of recommendations for a
                        new relationship with Japan, including a new regime for the Ryukyus. The new
                        relationship would take account of the growth of Japanese nationalism, the
                        mounting Communist threat in Southeast Asia, and the widespread desire in
                        Japan for a more assertive stance toward the United States and a more
                        prominent role in the Free World.</p>
                    <p>I share Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName>'s view
                        that we face a changing situation in Japan presenting dangers for United
                        States interests if we fail to respond correctly, and opportunities if we
                        do. I also share his view that our approach should be two pronged—removal of
                        avoidable irritations in our relations, and high-level talks with the
                        Japanese to <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0164"/>review our common
                        interests in the Far East and to stimulate the Japanese to a larger role in
                        the promotion of those interests.</p>
                    <p>My colleagues and I intend to do our utmost, in cooperation with other
                        interested agencies, to arrive at agreements with the Japanese on civil air,
                        fisheries, textiles and other bilateral economic issues. We are also working
                        with public and private elements to promote better understanding in Japan of
                        the Viet-Nam conflict and of our common interests there. We intend to
                        explore within the United States Government the possibility of closer
                        financial relationships which would help to sustain a satisfactory economic
                        growth rate in Japan and further to bind Japanese interests with those of
                        the United States. I am hopeful that by early 1966 we will have reduced
                        substantially existing irritations and misunderstandings in US-Japanese
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of matters on which I believe our own views and interests
                        should be clarified before we undertake formal, high-level talks with the
                        Japanese. I suggest that our two Departments complete by late fall
                        confidential studies of (a) the desirable missions, size and composition of
                        the Japanese defense forces in the years ahead; (b) our future requirements
                        in the Ryukyus, including analysis of whether administrative responsibility
                        for the Ryukyuan population could be carried out by Japan without impairing
                        the value of our bases; and (c) the overall US-Japan strategic
                        relationship—political, economic and military—which will best serve our
                        common interests in the Far East. If you agree, our staffs can work out
                        detailed arrangements for these studies.<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">The

                        Ryukyus. If the question were raised by the Japanese, he would give them no
                        basis whatsoever for believing that we might be prepared to modify our

                    <p>Between September 27 and October 1, 1965, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> and General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WMGAII1">Watson</persName> reviewed a range of problems
                        pertaining to the Ryukyus. Both agreed that the security of the U.S.
                        military presence on Okinawa was dependent on the Japanese fully
                        understanding their own security interests and their role in maintaining
                        stability in Southeast Asia. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGAII1"
                            >Watson</persName> announced his decision to change the method of
                        selecting the Ryukyu Chief Executive, who was currently appointed by the
                        High Commissioner. Both the Ambassador and the Department of State concurred
                        that such a change could defuse criticism of United States administration of
                        the Islands and satisfy local desires for more autonomy, at least for the
                        immediate future.</p>
                    <p>The manner of selecting the Chief Executive was considered within the
                        Department of State over the ensuing weeks, with the merits of two methods
                        discussed: election by the legislature and direct election by the voting
                        population. The Department of State, Department of Defense, High
                        Commissioner, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1"
                            >Reischauer</persName> all agreed on the former course, on the grounds
                        that it posed less of a risk than direct election by a restive populace. On
                        December 20, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> signed
                        an Executive Order implementing the voting change. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WMGAII1">Watson</persName> also announced the change in
                        procedure on December 20, an announcement carefully timed to follow the
                        election of the Mayor of Naha and to precede the introduction of a motion
                        pending in the <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0166"/>Ryukyuan legislature

                        <item>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s position
                            is probably secure for the period of this estimate. It is unlikely that
                            his conservative majority will shrink significantly in the next lower
                            house elections, which will probably be held in 1966. The major threat
                            to his position is the current business slowdown, but we believe that
                            his administration's fiscal measures and the basic strengths of the
                            economy will prevent further deterioration and permit a modest recovery
                            within a year or so.</item>

                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>Another major problem for <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                            is his identification with generally unpopular US policies in Vietnam.
                            If extremists who now lead the opposition Socialist Party succeed in
                            exploiting the issue to mount mass demonstrations on the scale of those
                            in 1960, <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> might be forced to
                            resign in favor of another, less identifiably pro-US conservative
                            leader. On balance, however, we believe that the leftists will not
                            succeed in removing <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> with
                            these tactics under foreseeable circumstances.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>Economic conflicts between Japan and the US will remain, but none has
                            so far caused or is likely to cause any serious or lasting damage to a
                            generally friendly relationship, or jeopardize the political stability
                            of the <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> administration. The
                            main problems in Japanese relations with the US will continue to be
                            those of Communist China, Vietnam, and Okinawa. Japanese trade with
                            Peking will continue to increase, though at a less spectacular rate than
                            in recent months. In 1966, <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                            will probably extend credit guarantees to cover exports to Communist
                            China. He will seek to avoid diplomatic recognition of Peking as long as
                            possible; but if Peking gained significant further international
                            recognition, he would probably follow suit, hoping that any impairment
                            of Japan's relationship with Taiwan would be temporary.</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>Japan will continue to rely on the Security Treaty with the US for
                            military protection. While some qualitative improvement is in prospect,
                            there is little chance that <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                            will press for any major increases in Japan's own defense forces over
                            the next two or three years. He will remain sensitive to public concerns
                            on Vietnam and will continue to oppose the use of Okinawan bases for
                            direct bombing attacks, particularly on North Vietnam. We foresee a
                            growth of Japanese nationalism and self-assurance, which will be
                            reflected in a somewhat more independent policy toward the US on these
                            and other issues, and in a more active political role in general in East
                            Asia.</item>
                        <label>E.</label>
                        <item>Nonetheless, Japan's initiatives in foreign affairs are apt to be
                            cautious and pragmatic, designed to further its efforts to expand trade
                            in as many directions as possible. Willingness to support plans for
                            development of Southeast Asia will be similarly conditioned; Japan is
                            not prepared to accept US direction on its economic assistance role in
                            the area.</item>

                                <item>Reversion of the Ryukyus to Japanese control would degrade the
                                    US strategic posture and seriously impair the US military
                                    position in the Far East. Exclusive US jurisdiction over the
                                    Ryukyus will continue for the foreseeable future to be essential
                                    to US and Free World security interests. Recent political
                                    problems with Japan over US use of Okinawa in support of Vietnam
                                    operations indicate the nature of the difficulties which the
                                    United States would likely encounter if the Ryukyus were under
                                    Japanese administrative control, even with special treaty
                                    provisions. This is particularly true [<hi rend="italic">1 line

                                    conditions in Southeast Asia, as well as in other areas around
                                    the periphery of Communist China, it would be premature and
                                    unrealistic to attempt to draw up a timetable for returning the
                                    Ryukyus to Japanese control.</item>

                                <item>Unilateral US control of Ryukyuan administrative procedures is
                                    essential for as long as we maintain major bases there to

                                    imposition of political limitations by another country upon the
                                    utilization of our Okinawa-based forces, equipment, materiel,
                                    and other resources. Less than full US administrative control of
                                    Okinawa would inhibit the operational flexibility of US military
                                    forces based there and might directly affect our nuclear
                                    capabilities in the Far East. Therefore, any transfer of
                                    administrative rights over the Ryukyus to Japan would severely
                                    dilute the military value of our Okinawan bases, particularly if
                                    there should be a change adverse to US interests in the
                                    Government or policies of Japan.</item>

                                    effort, that pressure has not resulted in significant increases
                                    in its defense budget or in the scope of its defense mission,
                                    and it is premature to anticipate developments in this direction
                                    which would decrease the need for continued control of Okinawa

                                    should also continue to transfer additional functions to the
                                    Ryukyuan Government, provided that such actions do not adversely
                                    affect US security interests or impair our freedom of military

                    </list>
                    <p>The relations between the United States and Japan are currently very good
                        indeed. The Japanese officials like to worry about Vietnam, but in fact they
                        are substantially less troubled about it than they were a year ago. It is
                        true that Vietnam gives the Socialists an easy stick with which to beat the
                        United States, but members of the government respond quite well to a
                        reminder that the United States cannot be expected to engage in appeasement
                        or surrender simply in order to solve political problems which the Japanese
                        themselves ought to handle.</p>
                    <p>Okinawa is a difficult matter. For the immediate future, there is no urgent
                        problem and I do not think a single Japanese newspaperman or public official
                        asked me one question about our base there or the treatment of the
                        Okinawans, but between now and 1968 the situation is sure to change. We have
                        about six months in which to frame a careful and forward-looking policy
                        which will allow us to trade with the Japanese effectively.</p>
                    <p>In essence, the desirable trade would be one which restored Japanese civil
                        government in Okinawa while insuring explicit Japanese acceptance of
                        whatever military rights we need there. The trick here is <pb n="137"
                            xml:id="pg_137" facs="0173"/>that we need nuclear rights in Okinawa and
                        that it will be hard for the Japanese to grant them explicitly. (Right now
                        the question does not arise simply because our military rights are unlimited
                        under the terms of the peace treaty.)</p>
                    <p>Both the Okinawans and the Japanese will be pressing for full civil
                        government, but as of 1966 it would be very difficult for the authorities in
                        Tokyo to admit that they were accepting nuclear weapons on Japanese soil by
                        their own free choice.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> believes that
                        this circle can be squared if we give the Japanese time and if as a
                        government we are ready with our own position ahead of time. As I understand
                        it, there is agreement already that State and Defense will be working on a
                        new Okinawan policy in the coming months. But over the years experience has
                        shown that State and Defense alone do not do a very good job on Okinawa. The
                        problem tends to remain at a low level in both departments, and at this low
                        level the desires of the diplomats and the military tend to clash with the
                        result that no new agreed policy gets formulated. Like Panama and <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, Okinawa by its very nature needs to have
                        a White House push.</p>
                    <p>So I venture to suggest that you might wish to tell <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> to get his fingers into this
                        one and make sure that you get current and timely information on the
                        progress of the deliberations.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">In a May 30

                            President and outlining its major points, <persName>Rostow</persName>
                            included three recommendations: a) that he be given responsibility for
                            monitoring the issue for the President, b) that the Departments of State
                            and Defense establish a working group to study the question, and c) that
                            a member of his staff serve in that group. <persName>Rostow</persName>'s
                            memorandum does not indicate whether President <persName
                                corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> approved those recommendations
                            or initiated any action relevant to the issue. Efforts were already
                            underway, however, to form a joint State-Defense working group and to
                            reevaluate the Ryukyus problem. (Minutes of the Far East
                            Interdepartmental Group meeting, May 25, and memorandum from <persName

                        here because timing may be a quite critical factor in any new decisions on
                        Okinawa, and neither State nor Defense is set up to make the kind of
                        political judgment that a question of timing always presents.</p>

                            that creation of Japanese strike force for mainland targeting was not
                            beyond possibility, and that Japan could afford costs involved. Said

                            reacted favorably to his suggestions along these lines, and that he had

                        <item>Problem of new international airport for Tokyo area has become acute.
                            Foreign Ministry North American Bureau Director <persName
                                corresp="#p_YT1">Yasukawa</persName> told Deputy Chief of Mission
                            that even if decision made to proceed immediately with construction at
                            proposed Tomisato site in Chiba prefecture, it would be ten years before
                            airport could be operational. Embassy officers agree construction time
                            Tomisato would be minimum of 5 years, maximum of ten years, after
                            decision made, which does not seem imminent now because of political
                            difficulties. In meantime, <persName corresp="#p_YT1"
                                >Yasukawa</persName> said, Haneda is becoming crowded and will be
                            saturated by [garble—1971?] five years before first date by which he
                            expected Tomisato could be in operation. Emergency expansion of some
                            nearby airfield not now in sustained use did not appear feasible because
                            of interference with flight patterns at Haneda and military fields.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yasukawa</persName> said that those in
                            govt concerned with defense did not favor asking U.S. to give up an
                            airfield in Tokyo area or share such a field for civilian use, but that
                            situation may well develop when govt will be compelled to make such a
                            request. Newspapers have reported in last few days that this may be one
                            of matters brought up by Japanese side at forthcoming cabinet level

                    <p>2. Embassy believes that coincidence of D. above with other three factors
                        make this the time for U.S. Govt to take a realistic look at what air units
                        we expect to have in Japan over next five years, and where they ought to be
                        located. At present we are concentrated in the area of highest population
                        density and political sensitivity around the capital city of Tokyo. There
                        are problems with jet noise, highly desirable land, national image, etc.
                        which are more significant here than in other parts of Japan away from major
                        urban centers. Actions which we might take now or over the next year or two
                        to change this situation would result in helpful public reactions which
                        would in turn pay off in terms of popular attitudes leading up to 1970
                        period, which will be critical for the continuation of the security treaty.
                        Implementation of the idea that Japan should be responsible for air
                        activities (including primarily air defense) around its capital would be a
                        contribution to the growth of defense-mindeness at a time when attitudes on
                        defense particularly critical.</p>
                    <p>3. There has been a down trend in the strength of our air units in Japan over
                        the years, occasioned not by demands from Japan but by economy-mindedness on
                        part of U.S. and higher priority needs for air units elsewhere. Our
                        capability for air defense contribution has been small since removal of
                        F–102s in 1964. If trend continues, we may well have no tactical aircraft
                        stationed in Japan five or ten year hence. If this is likely probability,
                        then we ought to begin talking with Japanese soon about effect this will
                        have on need to retain facilities. Even at present time. For instance,
                        Embassy sees no military reasons for considering Tokyo area optimum base for
                        F–105s or similar aircraft, which are targeted against areas outside of
                        Japan, while there are strong political and economic reasons why their being
                        based in this area will be a growing <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0177"
                        />liability in the next few years. There are, of course, ample reasons
                        (principally cost of preparing alternative facilities elsewhere) why it is
                        not easy to pick up and move, but we ought to be thinking ahead.</p>
                    <p>4. Embassy therefore recommends that State–Defense study be begun as soon as
                        feasible on future air posture of U.S. forces in Japan.<note n="5"

                        consideration of degree to which we expect Japan to take over air defense
                        and whether we should try to retain some part of air defense responsibility;
                        what kinds of air units, in addition to air defense units, if any, we want
                        to maintain in Japan as of 1971 and perhaps 1976; what would be optimum
                        location of such units from military point of view; what administrative
                        facilities, including airfields for administrative and logistic use, will be
                        needed, and where should they be located, etc. Study should be done from
                        point of view of military desirability without allowance for costs involved;
                        political and domestic Japanese economic considerations should then be taken
                        into account and, as final step, study should be made joint with <gloss

                        would involved therein, which we would expect Japan to bear in proper
                        proportion.</p>
                    <p>5. Thus to make our long-range plans in conjunction with <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would, in Embassy opinion, be far better
                        than allowing long-range policy in the end to be determined by day-to-day
                        decisions made for short-term or operational reasons. Long-range plan,
                        agreed to by Japan, would provide rational framework for solution of locally
                        troublesome problems such as Mito Range, joint use of airports, noise, etc.
                        Moreover, this approach would give us the maximum benefit in terms of impact
                        on Japanese defense thinking and public attitudes towards defense in general
                        and the security relationship with the U.S. in particular.</p>
                    <p>6. Embassy realizes that matters such as progress of Vietnam war make it
                        difficult to arrive at decisions now on questions five or ten years hence.
                        This should not, however, deter us from doing the best we can and coming up
                        now with the best plan we can make for the <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142"

                        well mean that our future capabilities will be determined by other factors
                        beyond our control, resulting in a lessened value to the U.S. of our air
                        bases in Japan and unnecessary strains in our defense and political
                        relations with Japan.</p>

                            Japan, <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he was impressed
                            by two points Ambassador had emphasized, that Japan is now a world power
                            again, and that U.S. sees American and Japanese national interests as
                            parallel. He agreed completely with this formulation, and said these two
                            ideas formed basis on which U.S. should understand Japan. From the point
                            of view of Japan's being a major country, <persName corresp="#p_SE3"

                            expressed gratification that although Japan was not militarily engaged
                            in that conflict U.S. had kept him well informed of developments there.
                            Noted that no chance for peace should be neglected and perhaps such
                            chances had to be made, not waited for. Said great powers often thought
                            to have primary responsibility for maintaining order but he thought that
                            the other side, even though much smaller, also had a responsibility.
                            Both sides shared responsibility for getting together for solution of
                            war, and he repeated his earlier statement that U.S. should keep up the
                            bombing and at the same time show a “gentle face.”</item>

                        <item>Prime Minister said Japan's basic attitude towards the Ryukyus and

                            arbitrary to him, and he thought matters concerning taxes and elections

                                >Johnson</persName> had told him last year that U.S. guarantees were

                            review. Said Japan was not thinking of building own nuclear forces, and
                            would cooperate on question of nonproliferation. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> had a very difficult problem on question of

                            There had been no fundamental change in <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"

                            were weak and this was a domestic problem. He wanted to build defense

                            out loud publicly. He asked that U.S. not say anything about the
                            percentage of GNP applied to defense, as this would cause <gloss

                            that earlier U.S. had sometimes referred to this matter but that for

                            realized balance of payment was in favor of Japan and that U.S. payments
                            due to Vietnam war were problem for us. <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> said he understood U.S. difficulty and was trying

                            to businessmen very well. Ambassador noted this remained very important
                            problem for U.S. and there were other areas besides trade where Japan
                            could be helpful. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he

                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> then said he wanted to raise
                            one more question, and ask for U.S. help in connection with forthcoming
                            visit of USSR FonMin Gromyko (last week of July). Said that when Sov
                            Fisheries Minister Ishkov was in Japan recently Ishkov maintained there
                            was no connection between fisheries agreements and problem of “northern
                            territories” (Kunashiri and Etorofu Islands). <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName>, however, had insisted to Ishkov that there was a
                            connection, and he thought there might have been something new in the
                            way in which Ishkov talked. Latter said, according to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>, that Okinawa was occupied by U.S.
                            and Kunashiri and Etorofu by USSR. <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> replied that U.S. was in Okinawa as result of a
                            treaty with Japan, while Soviets held northern islands illegally without
                            a treaty. From way in which Ishkov avoided further discussion <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> felt he had scored point,
                            especially since Japan Communist Party and socialist party had always
                            claimed that way to get northern islands [garble—back?] was to get U.S.
                            out of Okinawa.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> then asked rhetorically what
                            was the best way to “clean up” the northern islands problem.
                            Bilaterally? Through appeal to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>? World
                            Court? Said it was too early to make specific decision but would
                            eventually ask U.S. advice. He realized Sovs had great difficulty in
                            giving on territorial problem vis-á-vis Japan since they were faced with
                            number of similar territorial problems with European neighbors. On other
                            hand years passed and reality had to be recognized, since it continued
                            to be reality whether recognized or not. Germany and Korea were still
                            divided, and Japan had its northern islands problem. U.S. had recognized
                            Japan's “residual sovereignty” in Ryukyus and it would be well if USSR
                            did same regarding northern islands. <persName corresp="#p_SE3"

                        <item>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE6">Shiina</persName> told
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> thinks the security problem in the Far
                            East is more important than the so-called “reversion” of Okinawa, but
                            the problem is neither easy nor simple. Twenty years have passed since
                            the end of the war and this question has aroused vocal public opinion.
                            This public reaction may become more severe unless it is treated
                            tactfully. It would help to ameliorate this problem if the U.S. would
                            consider broadening its attitude on the question of the expansion of
                            local autonomy. He did not mean that anything should be done of such a
                            scale that would greatly surprise the Okinawans, but it would be good to
                            take a lenient view. If public opinion was kept under pressure, this
                            would only increase the opposition. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE6"
                                >Shiina</persName> thought that the agitation regarding reversion
                            could be countered by action in the area of local autonomy.</item>

                        <item>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE6">Shiina</persName> then
                            mentioned the Bonin Islands. He noted that there had been 7,000
                            residents when the population was moved from the Bonin Islands to Japan
                            during the war. By now, however, very few of them still wish to go back.
                            The majority have found jobs on the mainland of Japan. Because they have
                            not been permitted to return to the islands, however, even those who do
                            not themselves wish to go back have joined in the pressure on this
                            matter. The Foreign Minister wondered whether it would not be possible
                            to experiment with the idea of letting two or three hundred return to
                            the islands as a way of dodging this problem. If the residents realize
                            that they can go back they would gain psychological assurance and would
                            calm down. This was not an urgent problem but he hoped the U.S. would
                            give consideration to it.</item>

                            answer could be. He saw problems of trying to create a reasonable
                            standard of living for civilians in these islands. There might also be
                            military problems. He said he would look into this question and let
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> know.<note

                            He understood this was a public opinion problem in Japan and thought
                            this would continue until reversion was accomplished, U.S. bases were
                            gone and the Security Treaty had ended. He questioned whether
                            intermediate steps would satisfy or increase public opinion. Public
                            opinion might be insatiable. President Kennedy had asked Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> whether the Japanese
                            request regarding the flying of flags and the joint effort to improve
                            the standard of living were steps which could stand on their own merit
                            or whether <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0184"/>they were part of a
                            nibbling process to which there would be no end. <persName

                            nibbling process but that action on these matters would make an
                            important difference, and so President Kennedy had agreed.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thought that the
                            Okinawa base would be vital as long as Peking had not turned clearly to
                            peaceful coexistence. He would be glad, however, to consult regarding
                            problems of public opinion. However, the U.S. was concerned with the war
                            in Southeast Asia. It had been necessary to use the Okinawa base for
                            that war and this had created adverse public opinion. Would this not be
                            worse if Japan had a great direct responsibility for Okinawa? The U.S.
                            cannot accept greater limitations on our base rights. From the point of
                            view of the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> he wondered whether it
                            was not in a stronger position by not having to consent. Nevertheless,
                            the Secretary did not want this problem to harm U.S.-Japan relations and
                            he hoped for frank discussions. If there could be peace in Southeast
                            Asia, this would help the Ryukyus problem.</item>

                            urged Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE6">Shiina</persName> and
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> to stay in

                                >Johnson</persName> regarding what the real problem was, what the
                            right relations would be, and what the end result was that was desired.
                            Then at least the top leaders of the government could be in agreement
                            even though public opinion problems might develop.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE6">Shiina</persName> said that he had not
                            been to Okinawa and he had not studied in detail how local autonomy
                            might be expanded without weakening the military base. He wanted the
                            Secretary to understand, however, that what he had said was only from
                            the point of view of trying to find a way to satisfy public opinion
                            without weakening the military base.</item>

                            broad sense the U.S. favored autonomy. He would discuss this further
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName>. He
                            was not sure, however, that it was possible to satisfy public opinion.
                            Public opinion pressure would grow. Its emphasis might shift, but it
                            would continue to be a problem.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> noted that the
                            newspapers had reported that a 10 year extension of the Security Treaty
                            beyond 1970 was desired. The Japanese Government, however, had not yet
                            reached any such conclusion. He was sure that Japan wanted the Security
                            Treaty to continue and the Government was considering what would be the
                            best means to have that done.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that he
                            would be glad to keep in close and discreet touch on this matter. It was
                            better not to create problems of public opinion until the Governments
                            themselves had formed their opinions. As far as he knew, the U.S. would
                            want the Treaty to continue. If Japan agreed with this, he thought it
                            best to consider whether any changes at all were desirable. The basic
                            question was whether both countries wanted the Treaty to continue. As
                            far as he was concerned, the answer for the U.S. was yes. How to handle
                            this as a tactical matter would be another question. Except for
                            President de Gaulle,<note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">In March 1966 President
                                de Gaulle terminated his country's participation in the military

                                forces. France's withdrawal was expected to be complete by April
                                1969. (<hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,

                            for the treaty with <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0186"/>Japan). Of
                            course, any country could, if it wanted, take advantage of the ability
                            to terminate the treaty on one year's notice.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary suggested that contacts between the U.S. and Japan on
                            this matter be discreet. If the discussions become public, there might
                            be problems in both countries. We should not borrow 1970's troubles
                            today.</item>

                        <item>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said
                            emphatically that there was no de Gaulle in Japan. Moreover, regarding
                            changes in the Treaty, there would be even greater difficulties in the
                            Japanese Diet than in the U.S. Senate. As the Secretary said, this
                            matter could be considered quietly but he thought it ought to be
                            considered now before it becomes urgent. He noted that there were many
                            opinions regarding the Treaty in Japan. The Liberal Democratic Party had
                            put out a tentative report on this subject but this should not be
                            considered Government policy.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary said that it might be that before this matter reached
                            the point of decision there would be peace in Southeast Asia and this
                            would reduce the tension regarding the Security Treaty. The Prime
                            Minister replied that personally he seriously doubted whether that hope
                            would materialize in time but he thought both sides should discuss the
                            Treaty in the interim.</item>

                        <item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that the
                            nature of the criticism that would arise in the U.S. if the Treaty again
                            came up for discussion was that the Treaty was too unilateral. The U.S.
                            had pledged American lives for the defense of Japan but there was no
                            similar pledge of Japanese lives for the defense of the U.S. This could
                            cause debate in the United States if brought up at this time. At the
                            press conference today he had been asked whether the U.S. would defend
                            Japan with nuclear weapons if Japan suffered a nuclear attack. He had
                            said that any such attack would be insane but that if it happened, the
                            U.S. would defend Japan with whatever was required.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary asked whether, in the absence of a Security Treaty with
                            the United States, there would be strong pressure in Japan to develop
                            nuclear weapons. The Prime Minister replied that he personally did not
                            think it would be a good thing for Japan to follow France; the majority
                            of the Japanese people had not forgotten Hiroshima and were opposed to
                            nuclear weapons. Now that Communist China has a nuclear capability,
                            however, arguments have appeared in Japan that Japan would need nuclear
                            weapons for its own defense.</item>

                            problems. He was happy that the civil air agreement had been concluded
                            since the last Joint Economic Conference. He had mentioned some other
                            matters during the conference on which Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> would follow up. Among these
                            was the problem of Micronesian claims on which he hoped action could be
                            taken. He noted that the U.S. and Japan also had to think about
                            fisheries and similar matters but the important questions for both
                            countries are the larger matters which involve the rest of the
                            world.</item>

                            now that the civil aviation matter was settled, there still remained one
                            small problem—that is wool textiles. He had noted last year that this
                            problem had caused President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                >Johnson</persName> concern and it was still pending. The Secretary
                            said that it would, of course, remain pending until it had been finally
                            settled. This was a troublesome matter and he hoped it could be taken
                            care of.</item>

                            however, that the President had far greater worries.</item>

                            doubt would be at the right time but now what was needed was more effort
                            at the working level. The next move was up to the EEC.</item>

                            time of the first Joint Economic Committee meeting at Hakone, a cartoon
                            had appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Washington</hi> Post alleging that
                            the Pacific was a “one way street” as far as trade was concerned. At
                            that time the U.S. had had a favorable balance of trade. Now the
                            situation is reversed and the balance is in favor of Japan. He thought
                            however, that this was a natural phenomenon and should be treated as
                            such.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that Japan has a
                            favorable trade balance with the U.S. of about $300 million a year and
                            in addition to this, obtains $300 to $350 million from American military
                            expenditures in Japan. He hoped that the U.S. Treasury representatives
                            and those of the Japanese Finance Ministry would discuss this problem.
                            If the problem is a serious one, he hoped that a way would be found to
                            settle it without hurting relations between the two countries. He noted
                            that Japanese sales to the U.S. were rising faster than American sales
                            to Japan, but said we should see what happens. He noted that the Vietnam
                            war adds a billion dollars to the U.S. balance of payments problem. This
                            is one of the many reasons we would like to see peace in Southeast
                            Asia.</item>

                                progress in disarmament, which involved sacrifices by the nuclear

                        Ryukyu Islands and its military bases on Okinawa culminated in an
                        Interdepartmental Working Group, consisting of representatives <pb n="155"
                            xml:id="pg_155" facs="0191"/>from the Departments of State, Defense, and

                        report entitled <hi rend="italic">Our Ryukyus</hi> Bases. The report, August
                        24, 1966, concluded that the U.S. role in the Ryukyus was approaching a
                        period of transition necessitating increased local autonomy, the eventual
                        transfer of sovereignty over the Islands to Japan, and at the same time
                        retention by the United States of unrestricted rights to utilize and operate
                        its bases, including deployment of nuclear weapons. On September 13 the
                        report was reviewed by the Senior Interdepartmental Group, which adopted its
                        recommendations “to expand local Ryukyuan autonomy and increase the Japanese
                        role in Ryukyuan affairs without impairing the essential integrity of U.S.
                        administration and the operational capability of the U.S. bases in the

                        in sense that conservatives will be voted out of power and Leftists will
                        take over who will cooperate with neither U.S. nor Japan and who will
                        destroy usefulness of U.S. bases in Okinawa; some measures to provide
                        “safety valve” are necessary to prevent anti-American and anti-Japanese
                        explosion; Ryukyuans need to have faith restored in Japan as homeland which

                            gradual basis of functional areas of Okinawan administration, unrelated

                            recommended the return of Japan's administrative rights over the
                            Okinawan educational system as a first step toward functional reversion.
                            The concept was criticized by government officials and <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> members for being too vague,
                            oversimplifying the nature of the problem, and conflicting with

                        actual field of operation of Education Ministry would be quite small and

                    <p>3. Chargé and EmbOffs pointed out U.S. view of Okinawa problem is different.
                        Freedom to use military bases for direct operational purposes and for
                        nuclear purposes is key factor in usefulness of U.S. bases in Okinawa, and
                        this freedom is denied U.S. bases in Japan proper under security treaty.
                        Japan benefits from U.S. defense efforts in Far East and nuclear, umbrella,
                        but has not yet found it possible to share responsibility with U.S. in these
                        areas. Until such time as Japan decides to share responsibility and onus
                        with U.S. for unrestricted use of bases in Okinawa, U.S. feels that
                        undivided U.S. administration of Okinawa is necessary. From our point of
                        view, therefore, problem is for Japan to move forward in defense field to
                        extent that will facilitate solution of Okinawa problem, rather than for
                        U.S. to divide administration under present circumstances.</p>

                    <p>4. EmbOffs further noted any division of administrative authority to place

                        [garble—to <gloss target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss>] would cause considerable

                        that U.S. would suggest aid program of approx 20 million dollars. Japanese
                        explained that current <gloss target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss> demands for aid
                        total 25 million dollars. If <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> agrees to
                        U.S. proposal of 20 million dollars, it will be criticized for ignoring

                            >GOJ</gloss> proposes 25 million figure to U.S., it would anticipate

                        noted negotiations on <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> aid program were
                        between <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss>, not with <gloss target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss>, and

                        and ability absorb aid. Matter remained inconclusive, and Embassy would
                        appreciate advice from <gloss target="#t_HICOMHICOMRY1">HICOM</gloss>
                        whether Embassy should reiterate to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> that

                        remarks were strongly worded and clearly strongly meant. During discussion
                        of need for <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to move forward on defense
                        matters, he said that <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> certainly want to
                        do this, but that greater conservative strength is prerequisite. He stated
                        strongly that as far as he was concerned, Japan should realize U.S. was in
                        Okinawa to maintain world peace and <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0194"

                        included Japanese agreement to the introduction of nuclear weapons and
                        unrestricted use of bases. Embassy expects <persName>Mori</persName> will

                    <p>Secto 21/1716. Eyes Only for the President and the Acting Secretary.</p>
                    <p>I was pleased with the talk I had with Prime Minister <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> visited Tokyo from December
                            5–7 to meet with senior Japanese officials.</note> I drew him aside for
                        private discussion of the great importance of additional Japanese assistance
                        in Viet-Nam. His response was constructive and he immediately suggested the
                        possibility that he could build more Vietnamese assistance on the Southeast
                        Asia Agricultural Development Conference then in session in Tokyo. There is
                        a wide range of opportunity for Japanese personnel to pitch in in South
                        Viet-Nam and their immediate problem is to sort things out in Saigon so that
                        we can be quite specific about who is needed where and for what. A
                        qualification is <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s own weakened
                        political position and the possibility of national elections in the weeks
                        immediately ahead.</p>
                    <p>On other subjects, <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> was helpful and
                        relaxed about Okinawa, indicated clearly that they would move on the Prek

                            would be a mistake and urge that a way be found to permit the
                            continuance of this program which is so important to our long-range
                            interests here.</item>

                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program as such for Japan. This country
                            is admittedly capable of financing its own military needs.
                            Orientation/influence training, however, is not “assistance” to Japan.
                            It is a calculated action taken by the U.S. for its own purposes and in
                            its own interests, and for this purpose Japan should not be bracketed
                            with Western Europe or the U.K. I can well understand why this kind of
                            training may not meet the qualifications for “military assistance” to
                            other countries. However that does not mean that the program itself
                            should be terminated. Rather, I would hope we could exercise ingenuity
                            to find the small amount of necessary funds from another pocket if it is
                            not possible to continue to fund it from <gloss target="#t_MAP1"

                        <item>Left to themselves, Japanese self-defense forces will continue to
                            finance those trips to U.S. and training programs which they believe
                            desirable from their own point of view. Understandably they will tend
                                <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0196"/>to use their money to send
                            senior officers and those who have reasons of prestige or position for
                            wanting to go. There is nothing wrong in this and we will welcome these
                            officers. On the other hand, we have a positive interest in providing
                            U.S. influence over the younger officers who are still in the lower and
                            middle grades and who will be in positions of high command a generation
                            from now. This new generation of younger men will not have had the long
                            and broad contact with the U.S. forces in Japan which many of their
                            elders had. It may be a long time before they qualify under Japanese
                            requirements for training in the U.S. By that time their attitudes on
                            broad questions of strategy and international affairs may have been
                            hardened beyond our ability to influence. In long-range terms, we cannot
                            afford to neglect this opportunity to see to it that the next generation
                            of Japanese professional military men is oriented towards the U.S. Our
                            experience with the way our training programs for the Indonesian Army
                            had paid off ought to be a lesson to us in this regard. The fact that
                            the Japanese military forces do not now play a decisive role in the
                            affairs of this country does not mean that we can be complacent about
                            the long-range future. I have long been convinced that the money that we
                            put into bringing foreign military officers to the U.S. pays as big if
                            not bigger long-range dividends than any other funds we spend. The day
                            will come when the professional military men in this country, with all
                            of its potential for good or bad, will have a much stronger voice than
                            they now have. It will be important that that voice have been influenced
                            toward our point of view. We spend considerable sums doing this on the
                            civilian side.<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">Reference is to the

                    <p>These requests reflect a major reconsideration within the inner circles of
                        the Japanese Government of Japan's defense and security policies, focusing
                        on the crucial issue of Japanese nuclear policy over the next decade. At the

                    <p>For our part, the Japanese initiatives are welcome and in fact have preempted
                        plans we were developing for proposing broader security consultations with
                        Japan. The new security consultations will require from us considerably
                        greater frankness and specificity in discussing security matters including
                        nuclear weapons, but we are agreed on the necessity for this. The major
                        advantages to us are a major opportunity, first, to influence Japanese
                        defense strategy before it is finally formulated, including efforts to
                        discourage a Japanese nuclear program and encourage a broader regional
                        security role, and second, to develop a closer and more tightly knit
                        security relationship with Japan preparatory to the period when Japan will
                        play a major power role in Asia in security, as well as in economic,

                    <p>By late 1966 and early 1967 the United States and Japan initiated actions to
                        advance the Japanese role not only in Asia, but also in global affairs. As a
                        consequence, relations between the United States and Japan came to mirror
                        more closely the interactive relationship between the United States and its
                        most important European partners.</p>
                    <p>In mid-December 1966 Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs
                        Fredericks and Deputy Chief of the African Section of the Japanese Foreign
                        Ministry Nishisaki discussed a Japanese proposal for arranging regularly
                        scheduled, bilateral talks on Africa. The matter was followed-up by the
                        Japanese Embassy later that month. The Department of State, already
                        conducting such general discussions with its major European allies, welcomed
                        Japan's proposals for a similar arrangement to exchange ideas and
                        information on mutual African interests. After further discussion with
                        Japanese representatives and <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0201"
                        />consultation with the Embassy, the Department of State authorized the
                        Embassy on January 26, 1967, to conclude an agreement with the Japanese
                        Foreign Office for talks on Africa to take place once each year, with the
                        meeting site alternating between Washington and Tokyo. The informal talks
                        among Bureau-level officials would consist of a tour d'horizon as well as
                        discussion of specific interests of either side. After a series of
                        unavoidable delays, the first bilateral meeting on Africa took place on
                        December 18 and 19 in Washington. Documentation on the African talks is in
                        the National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files
                        1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 1 JAPAN–US.</p>
                    <p>Also in early 1967 the United States approached Japan with a proposal to
                        meet, in Tokyo and Washington in alternating years, shortly before the
                        opening of the United Nations General Assembly in order to exchange views on
                        current issues likely to be brought before that body. The United States
                        already had such an arrangement with Great Britain and had recently
                        initiated the practice with Canada. The first consultative meeting with the
                        Japanese took place on July 24 and 25 in Tokyo. The United States was
                        represented by former Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> and Assistant Secretary of State for International
                        Organization Affairs Sisco. Documentation covering the meetings is ibid.,

                        JAPAN–US. In the autumn of 1967 prior to the upcoming General Assembly,
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> informed
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> of Japan's
                        intention to assume a more active leadership role relative to political
                        issues coming before the United Nations, signaling a definitive shift in
                        Japan's prior overriding concern with economic matters. (Ibid., <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> 22–2 JAPAN)</p>
                    <p>As the Embassy pointed out, Japan's emergence as a major player on the world
                        stage led to increased Japanese interest in pursuing policies reflective of
                        its national interests and independence. In that regard, the need to settle
                        the Okinawa issue became more urgent, the Security Treaty and Japan's role
                        in defense and military issues were more widely discussed, and the view that
                        adherence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would make Japan an
                        unequal power and circumscribe its sovereignty emerged as a subject of some
                        debate. Japan's desire “for a prominent, unique and independent national
                        policy” was not, however, incompatible with the United States'
                        foreign-policy objective of having Japan accept a regional and global role
                        equal to its economic status. (Airgram A–1398 from Tokyo, April 17; ibid.,

                    <p rend="flushleft">Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>This thoughtful cable from Alex <persName>Johnson</persName> is the kind
                        Ambassadors should write but rarely do.</p>
                    <p>He conveys <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s anxiety that U.S.
                        détente with the U.S.S.R. could throw the Japanese position in Asia out of
                        balance.</p>
                    <p>It is parallel to Western European anxiety about the détente and the
                        non-proliferation treaty.</p>
                    <p>Basically, what Japan wants is a Communist China that is not so weak that it
                        is under Soviet dominance and not so strong that it threatens Japan. It
                        wants a Soviet Union not in open conflict with the U.S. but sufficiently
                        preoccupied with the U.S., China, etc., so that it must take Japan seriously
                        and doesn't feel free to lean on it.</p>
                    <p>Japan wants our protection, economic ties, and friendship. From that base it
                        wants to build a position of leadership in Asia; trade from a position of
                        strength with both Communist China and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>But it doesn't want us buddying up too close to either Communist China or the
                        U.S.S.R.—especially the latter, because of its greater relative
                        strength.</p>

                                anti-Russia feelings of Japan. Although Japan is appalled at much of
                                what is now going on in Communist China and is worried at the
                                Chinese development of nuclear weapons, what <persName

                            <item>We have recently had other signs of Japanese uneasiness over how
                                the U.S. attitude toward mainland developments might develop, with
                                some officials seeming to be concerned lest the United States might
                                be hoping for prolonged disorder as the optimum state of affairs. To
                                some extent this concern may reflect the worry that in the future
                                the U.S. might be tempted to take sides in the mainland imbroglio or
                                otherwise try to exploit the chaotic conditions there, and in the

                                U.S.-Japanese relations. First, while on the one hand they welcome a
                                reduction in US-Soviet “tension” and the opportunity to improve
                                their own relations with the Soviets, they are concerned that
                                relations between the two “super powers,” the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.,
                                not “improve” to the extent that we and the Soviets face Japan with

                            <item>The schizophrenia of Japan on the nuclear proliferation treaty is
                                a good example. Military considerations, e.g., the fact that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> requires Japan to renounce
                                its options while doing nothing to meet its immediate concerns,
                                which are the Soviet Union and Communist China, are in my opinion
                                only a part of the reason for Japan's ambivalence on the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Another important factor is the
                                Japanese hypersensitivity to any suggestion that the U.S. and
                                U.S.S.R. are moving toward a kind of “super-powers” club from which
                                Japan will be forever excluded. The drive toward parity with the
                                great powers has been one of the most consistent themes of Japan's
                                modern history. In spite of its present attitudes on military and
                                nuclear affairs, an implied relegation of Japan to second-class
                                status because of her non-possession of nuclear arms would
                                ultimately constitute a powerful incentive to go after an
                                independent nuclear capability. These attitudes are, of course,
                                being nurtured by public statements coming from West Germany,
                                probably communicating even more forcefully in Japanese-German
                                consultations on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Thus, I
                                tend to agree with Ambassador <persName>Takeuchi</persName> that
                                while in the end Japan will probably have no choice but to sign the

                                and Soviets are able to agree upon, we should not necessarily take

                            <item>Fisheries is another area where Japan discerns tendencies in
                                U.S.-Soviet relations that are disturbing to it: not so much because
                                of their intrinsic importance, but because of their reflection of
                                what it discerns as tendencies in U.S.-Soviet relations. Japan, of
                                course, recognizes that there is a certain basic congruence of
                                U.S.-Soviet fishing interests in the North Pacific as opposed to the
                                interests of Japan; however, I <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169"

                                the Japanese.<note n="5" xml:id="d84fn5">The Japanese concern was
                                    twofold: (1) U.S. claim to a 12-mile territorial right for
                                    fishing interests without considering Japan's historical fishing
                                    rights; and (2) U.S. propensity to treat Japan and the USSR
                                    equally, even though the latter claimed its own 12-mile sea
                                    right and fished off the U.S. coast for a shorter period of time

                                    agreements between the United States and Japan on major fishing
                                    issues were reached by an exchange of notes and agreed minutes
                                    on May 9. The agreements permitted some fishing by Japan within
                                    the 12-mile zone, restricted certain catches to beyond that
                                    zone, and addressed issues relevant to Japanese salmon fishing.

                                bargain hard with the Japanese on them, but in devising our tactics
                                we should be conscious of these Japanese attitudes and recognize
                                that Japanese may well read more in the way of broad political

                                expressing gratitude on behalf of the people of Okinawa for U.S. aid
                                since 1945. He cautioned, however, that some people were never happy
                                and the Opposition was very tough to handle. He said he had given
                                the details to the Secretary of the Army and would not take up the
                                Secretary's time by repeating them to him. He asked if the Secretary
                                had any questions.</p>

                            <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MS1"
                                    >Matsuoka</persName> for his view of the long-run relationship
                                between the U.S. military forces on Okinawa and the Okinawans. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Matsuoka</persName> answered that the
                                Conservatives understood the situation in the Far East and the
                                resulting need for the U.S. presence. The Opposition, however, did
                                not and they continued to clamor for the removal of U.S. forces. He
                                said the Opposition now numbered about 45% of the legislature and
                                was gradually increasing.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MS1"
                                    >Matsuoka</persName> how the Opposition would feel if the U.S.
                                did leave Okinawa. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MS1"
                                    >Matsuoka</persName> replied that the leftists <pb n="171"
                                    xml:id="pg_171" facs="0207"/>don't look at the effect this would
                                have on the economy; rather, they point to and exploit the fact of
                                foreign presence on Okinawan soil, a politically potent subject. He
                                said the Opposition ignored the fact that the foreign exchange
                                gained from U.S. presence helps to balance out the excess of
                                Okinawan imports over exports. He indicated his concern over a
                                possible two-fold effect if the amendment to the Price Act fails to
                                pass: (1) $5 million shortage in the <gloss target="#t_GRI1"
                                    >GRI</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>67 budget and (2) increased
                                propaganda by the Opposition against U.S. control when Japanese aid
                                is greater than that given by the U.S.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MS1"
                                    >Matsuoka</persName> how he believed <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                    >GOJ</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss> officials
                                would act toward U.S. bases if the administration of Okinawa did
                                revert to Japan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Matsuoka</persName>
                                answered that because of the dispersion of the bases over the island
                                and the resulting interrelationships, the leftist and communist
                                elements could cause agitation which would be very hard to control.
                                The Secretary said that to him this raised a fundamental long-range
                                question concerning the willingness of the American people to remain
                                in Okinawa, thereby protecting the Okinawans and the Japanese,
                                unless the Okinawans and the Japanese want the U.S. there and are
                                willing to provide the environment necessary to make that stay
                                militarily effective.</p>
                            <p>Indicating that he was still speaking on a personal basis and not
                                giving a U.S. Government position, The Secretary said he believed
                                that Okinawans and Japanese need to study very carefully their own
                                self-interest in continued U.S. presence on Okinawa. The U.S. cannot
                                govern Okinawa indefinitely and should not impose its will on other
                                countries. If the Japanese and Okinawans find it in their own
                                self-interest for the U.S. to remain, they should begin moving
                                toward a position of increasing political support for the U.S. and
                                its objectives, allowing the U.S. to make its role in the Far East
                                less unilateral. He indicated that the U.S. does not require Okinawa
                                to protect Hawaii or San Francisco. Furthermore, he did not believe
                                the U.S. public would support the defense of other countries who (1)
                                don't want to be defended or (2) want to be defended but don't want
                                to stand beside the U.S. politically.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary re-emphasized his view on two basic points (1) the U.S.
                                should not again be put in a position of having to stand alone and
                                (2) the need for Okinawan and Japanese political support. This
                                support would include the flexibility required to make U.S. presence
                                on Okinawa efficient from a military viewpoint. As a related but
                                broader proposition, The Secretary expressed his opinion that Japan
                                needs to take a much larger political and economic role in Asia and
                                that Asian nations need to undertake more long-term regional
                                activities. He pointed to recent healthy signs such as <gloss
                                    target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss>, and the Korea-Japan
                                settlement.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Matsuoka</persName> stated Prime
                                Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> had repeatedly
                                told him that Japan depends on the U.S. for protection. The Japanese
                                constitution <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0208"/>presents the
                                government with problems in this regard. Furthermore, by relying on
                                the U.S., the Japanese can devote their resources to economic
                                activities. He continued by noting that his party in Okinawa as well
                                as the Japanese Government realize the cost incurred by the U.S.
                                because of its stay on Okinawa. He said they also realize that the
                                U.S. remains there and bears this cost because of Communist tension.
                                The Secretary responded that he believes the U.S. should stay only
                                when the host country wants the U.S. to do so, Communist tension or
                                not. If it is strictly a unilateral U.S. decision, it is basically
                                wrong. He realizes that the Japanese and Okinawan people need time
                                to reconsider this problem and the public needs to be educated. He
                                also realizes that the U.S. should help by such actions as amending
                                the Price Act. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Matsuoka</persName>
                                reiterated his belief that the Japanese Government did realize that
                                the U.S. is paying for defense of Japan. He alluded to some recent
                                speeches which have brought out this point, especially those by the
                                Minister of Agriculture. The Secretary emphasized the need for a
                                viable U.S.-Japan partnership which included active political
                                support by Japan. As an example, he felt that in another Vietnam
                                Japan could not stand aside, but would need to play a positive
                                political role.</p>

                                            the era approaches (1970) when US-Japanese defense
                                            arrangements become subject to alteration with a
                                            one-year notification. Even partial loss of forward
                                            bases in Japan and Okinawa could necessitate reliance on
                                            bases in Marcus Island, the Marianas, and the
                                            Bonin–Volcano chain in support of the US forward defense
                                            posture. Moreover, base dispersal and the requirement

                                            significant as China develops a missile capability. The

                                            of activity, is the key to the issue.</item>

                                            estate, the United States would lose the land resources

                                            facilities. Political and civil problems would preclude

                            and other matters. He had discussed these subjects with the Prime
                            Minister and Foreign Minister before leaving Tokyo. Both are very
                            concerned about Okinawa and they probably will wish to take this subject
                            up during their respective visits to the U.S. this fall. Okinawa was

                        <item>The Ambassador said Okinawa and the Bonin Islands have been discussed
                            many times between the two sides at various levels, but he wished today
                            to describe the fundamental view of the Japanese Government. From the
                            Japanese point of view, one of the first aspects of the Okinawa problem
                            is the fact that Okinawa is the only Japanese territory where land
                            fighting took place during World War II. The continuation of U.S.
                            control in the islands has meant that they were also the only part of
                            Japanese territory to continue under military control after the Peace
                            Treaty. The suggestion in Article III of the Peace Treaty that the
                            Ryukyus might in due course be turned over to <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> trusteeship has never been carried out, and most Okinawa
                            people think of the present situation as a prolongation of military
                            occupation. The Ambassador recalled that both Secretary Dulles and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> had been
                            quoted as saying that history shows that a military occupation never
                            succeeds over a long period of time. The U.S. administration of the
                            Ryukyus has now gone on twenty years. While U.S. administration has been
                            wise and extremely generous, and the docile nature of the Okinawan
                            people has permitted a large degree of success in this military
                            occupation, the present trend of developments appears to be leading
                            toward the creation of new problems which might damage fundamental
                            U.S.-Japan relations.</item>

                        <item>The Ambassador said the Okinawa policy of the U.S. was created by
                            Secretary Dulles in the interests of stabilizing the security and peace
                            of the Far East. If the continuation of this policy leads to new
                            problems, however, it would be contrary to the achievement of the basic
                                <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0213"/>goal Secretary Dulles
                            sought. Therefore, the two governments must handle the Ryukyus problem
                            skillfully to prevent emergence of such new problems. The situation is
                            bound to deteriorate if the two sides do nothing about it. It is for
                            this reason that the Japanese Government desires to take up this problem
                            during the talks that are in prospect this fall. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ST5">Shimoda</persName> said he hoped the U.S. side
                            would be fully prepared to discuss this matter. He assumed that U.S.
                            readiness to discuss the problem this fall included the readiness of all
                            elements in the U.S. Government, up to the White House and including the
                            Defense Department.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> referred to Ambassador <persName

                            subject of Okinawa and asked whether there was any particular direction

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ST5">Shimoda</persName> said one aspect
                            of the Okinawa problem is military and another political. The Foreign
                            Office is not expert on the military aspects of the problem, but since
                            they are managing Japanese policy they need to have a valid military
                            evaluation of Okinawa. They appreciated very much the frank talks held
                            in Tokyo in May with the attendance of Ambassador

                            those talks were very useful, but even after hearing the U.S.
                            explanation of the military importance of Okinawa, the Japanese came out
                            with the feeling that the military situation is not likely to change
                            very much. Okinawa will continue to be very important militarily,
                            especially while the Vietnam conflict continues. While the military
                            importance may possibly increase, depending upon developments, it will
                            never decrease. There is no misunderstanding about the military
                            importance of Okinawa in the Japanese Government. Of course, many
                            contradictory things are said on occasion in Diet deliberations and in
                            the press, but Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                            and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> clearly

                        <item>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ST5">Shimoda</persName> said he felt
                            it was reasonable to expect that if Japan is to ask something from the
                            U.S. the Japanese side must formulate a concrete proposal.
                            Unfortunately, the Japanese Government has not reached any firm
                            conclusions, so it is somewhat awkward for the Japanese Government to
                            order <persName corresp="#p_ST5">Shimoda</persName> and others to
                            continue <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0214"/>their efforts to sound

                                the Embassy forwarded the text of an aide-mémoire on the Ryukyus and
                                the Bonins received that day from the Japanese Foreign Office. The
                                content of the aide-mémoire closely paralleled the substance of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_ST5">Shimoda</persName>'s presentation to
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName>; it reiterated Japan's desire for a
                                return of both island groups, while mindful of their military
                                importance to maintaining the security of the region, and it
                                mentioned that reversion sentiments among the Japanese population,
                                increasingly exploited by the opposition political parties, could
                                intensify to the detriment of U.S.-Japan relations. It also proposed
                                further study of the reversion issues, including the military
                                aspects, and the continuation of administrative reform in the
                                Ryukyus. As to the Bonins, the aide mémoire proposed that, given
                                their limited military significance, an agreement be reached to
                                return those islands to Japan. (Telegram 266 from Tokyo, July 14;

                                <item>the first concept is to permit the U.S. to retain its military

                                    limits. The rest of the territory of the Ryukyus would be
                                    returned to Japan. The bases would become a kind of concession,
                                    somewhat like the Japanese base at Port Arthur in the old days.
                                    Within the bases the U.S. would hold all powers of control. This
                                    concept is espoused by such conservative leaders as Diet member

                                        its military bases in the islands, including the
                                        introduction of nuclear weapons, by creating an exception to
                                        the Security Treaty requirement for prior consultation under
                                        certain circumstances. All administrative rights over the

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> asked if the
                            Japanese side intended to make specific proposals during the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> visits this fall. The Ambassador said that depended
                            to some extent on the soundings which he was instructed to carry out. He
                            could not say whether the Japanese side would come forward with specific
                            proposals. He recalled a recent statement by General <persName

                                target="#t_HICOMHICOMRY1">HICOMRY</gloss>) that he found the second
                            school of thought more concrete and the first one somewhat vague.
                                <persName corresp="#p_UGFT1">General Unger</persName> firmly stated,
                            however, that at this point he could say nothing about a preference
                            between the two concepts.</item>

                            of the Bonins from the Okinawa problem and earlier action on the Bonins
                            matter. Does the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> consider the two
                            problems separate?</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>The Ambassador said he wished to comment on that later. Referring
                            again to the readiness of the U.S. to discuss the Okinawa problem, he
                            asked whether the U.S. side would be prepared to give a firm view in
                            September, when Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MT3"
                                >Miki</persName> plans to visit Washington. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> said we would have to discuss this matter
                            on the U.S. side and provide a considered response as to which of the
                            alternative concepts appeared to us to be more realistic. We might be
                            able to indicate a clear preference between those two choices, but that
                            would still not mean a final decision that the preferred choice would be
                            wise from the U.S. point of view.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> asked whether either
                            of the problems outlined by the Ambassador would mean 100 per cent
                            freedom of U.S. use of the bases in the Ryukyus. The Ambassador said
                            that was correct. Under the first concept Japan would have only residual
                            sovereignty over the base enclaves. Under the second idea the whole
                            territory of the Ryukyu Islands would be under full sovereign Japanese
                            control, but the consultation clause of the Security Treaty affecting
                            the freedom of base utilization would by agreement not be applied in the
                            Ryukyus.</item>

                                corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> intended to take this matter up
                            during his visit in September preparing the ground for Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s discussions in
                            Washington in November. He assured the U.S. that no responsible Japanese
                            leader would ask for return of the military bases. He said he did not
                            wish to disturb the U.S. by a premature raising of this problem.</item>

                            Vietnam war was going on. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ST5"
                                >Shimoda</persName> said he felt the change must come even before

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> asked whether there was a relationship
                            in Japanese thinking between the Okinawa problem and the 1970 problem in
                            Japan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ST5">Shimoda</persName> said
                            there was no logical connection in the minds of Japanese leaders.
                            Opposition parties, of course, hope to connect the two. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> asked whether the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> had in mind the Okinawa settlement coming into effect
                            before 1970. The Ambassador said they did feel it would be better if it
                            could be accomplished before 1970. Such a basic change in status,
                            however, cannot be worked out overnight. The process might take days
                            months or even years, but the agreement at least should be concluded
                            before 1970. He emphasized the fact that his views were not instructed
                            Japanese Government views, since the Government had as yet reached no
                            conclusions.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> reverted again to the question whether
                            the Bonins problem was separate from Okinawa. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ST5">Shimoda</persName> felt it was a separate problem.
                            The Bonins constitute a new question for the Japanese public, for one
                            reason because it has been handled exclusively by conservative leaders.
                            Diet Member <persName>Fukuda</persName>, former Director of the Japan
                            Defense Agency and member of the Foreign Office, has handled the matter
                            quietly in his talks in Tokyo and Washington. He has not sought
                            publicity, so the problem has remained relatively quiet. Since the new
                            Socialist Governor of Tokyo, Minobe, has come into office, however, he
                            has approached the Prime Minister for some action on the Bonins. His
                            interest arises from the fact that the Bonin Islands fall within the
                            Tokyo Metropolitan Government's jurisdiction. Because of these recent
                            moves, the Bonins have drawn public attention in the Diet and in the
                            press. There is a possibility that this could become a hot issue. If it
                            does, it might be even more dangerous than Okinawa because of the
                            relationship to Tokyo where most of the former residents of the Bonins
                            live. The Ambassador said he felt for these reasons the two sides must
                            face this question squarely.</item>
                        <label>17.</label>
                        <item>The Ambassador said <persName>Fukuda</persName> had been of the view
                            that return of the former inhabitants would help to relax the tension
                            over this problem. <persName>Fukuda</persName>'s idea has not received
                            widespread support. The Ambassador said he believed that if the former
                            inhabitants were repatriated, it would create a new problem somewhat
                            like Okinawa. It would not be wise to permit repatriation.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d87fn5">The aide-mémoire also recognized that allowing
                                former residents to return could create additional problems and that

                                returns. (Ibid.)</note> He feels it would be far better to ask
                            immediately for reversion on the same pattern as Okinawa. The Japanese
                            Government recognizes the existence of military facilities in the
                            Bonins, and the need to preserve the military utility of those bases.

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> recalled from his
                            talks in Tokyo that there had been a number of different points of view
                            expressed even within the Foreign Office concerning the approach to the
                            Bonins problem. The Ambassador said a majority in the Foreign Office now
                            strongly favor reversion of the Bonins. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1"
                                >Berger</persName> recalled some concern that an earlier reversion
                            of the Bonins might create problems in Okinawa. The Ambassador asked if
                            this was not primarily a problem for the U.S. side. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> also recalled the fear of some
                            Foreign Office people that if the Bonins reverted to Japanese control
                            earlier, Okinawans might feel as though they had been sacrificed in the
                            deal between the two Governments. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ST5"
                                >Shimoda</persName> said he agreed that such a danger

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> asked whether the
                            Japanese side would have specific proposals formulated for presentation
                            during the talks in Washington this fall. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ST5">Shimoda</persName> said he did not know whether a
                            position would be formulated by that time. He intends to try to push the
                            Foreign Office, and the Director of the North American Affairs Bureau,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TFD1">Togo</persName>, also is pushing for the
                            formulation of a Japanese position. Before the Ambassador's departure
                            from Tokyo, <persName corresp="#p_TFD1">Togo</persName> was aiming at a
                            draft blueprint for presentation to Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> by the end of June. Sometime in
                            July, assuming <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> approved he
                            draft, they were aiming for a meeting with the Prime Minister. Based on
                            these discussions, the blueprint would then be redrafted, and if final
                            clearances were obtained within the Japanese Government, Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> would discuss it in
                            detail during his visit in Washington in September. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ST5">Shimoda</persName> said he hoped <persName

                            some clear ideas in September, otherwise there would only be another
                            exchange of vague views. He asked whether it would be disturbing to the
                            U.S. if <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> brought such a
                            blueprint with him in September.</item>

                            lines aide-mémoire, and in turn I pressed him hard to effect that heart

                            decisions on what kind of U.S. military presence it desired in area and

                                >GOJ</gloss> would have to assume if Okinawa administration returned

                        <item>While not arguing this point, <persName corresp="#p_MT3"
                                >Miki</persName> kept returning to desire to determine what were
                            “minimum” military requirements. In response to which I pointed out it
                            was not question of what were minimum U.S. requirements—in one sense we
                            could do almost anything, including getting out of Okinawa and East Asia
                            entirely—it was, as expressed in aide-mémoire, question of what was
                            common interest of both countries. To determine this it was necessary
                            for <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to decide what its interests
                            were. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> generally knew what we were
                            doing and could do out of Okinawa under present circumstances and could
                            itself see limitation that would be placed on U.S. (as well as increased
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> involvement and responsibility)
                            if present security treaty and <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>
                            were applied to Okinawa. While <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> now
                            subject to attack from opposition with respect to Okinawa, would <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> be able any better to handle opposition
                            attacks if arrangements in Okinawa were such as to give the flexibility
                            to maintain maximum military capabilities and, accordingly, maximum
                            deterrent value to Okinawa? I pointed out, for example, that question is
                            not whether Polaris replaces Okinawa but rather our ability to maintain
                            a graduated and thus more credible capability for response. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> stressed that Japan valued and
                            wanted U.S. military presence in East Asia and specifically desired that
                            there be U.S. military base on Okinawa and only problem was how to
                            reconcile Japanese desire for reversion with military requirements. To
                            do this <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> needed a good understanding
                            of what those requirements really were. I pointed <pb n="183"
                                xml:id="pg_183" facs="0219"/>out that ever since my arrival here I
                            had been seeking to establish a forum for just such a discussion with
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> and last security consultative
                            committee and sub-committee meetings were only first steps in this
                            direction. I welcomed this morning's discussion with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> and looked forward to further such

                                >Miki</persName> was very vague only stating that, as opposition
                            would not be able to make much of a 1970 issue on security treaty
                            question, they can be expected increasingly focus on Okinawa. On
                            relationship of timing to Vietnam war, he replied that they could see
                            problem of reaching final solution prior to end of Vietnam war, but felt
                            that in meanwhile we should be moving forward with serious joint
                            U.S.-Japan study of resolution of Okinawa problem.</item>

                        <item>On Bonins, I confined myself to saying that I agreed consideration

                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> very concerned re obtaining

                            estimate was that reversion of Bonins was significant factor re Okinawa
                            but would not exacerbate Okinawa problem.)</item>

                                            which provides for the military requirements essentially
                                            as set forth in Annex B. However, such an arrangement

                                <item>In recent years, the Government of Japan has endeavored to
                                    increase its knowledge and understanding of security questions,
                                    including the use of US bases in the Ryukyus. This maturing
                                    attitude on the part of Japan's leaders, together with the
                                    problems involved in establishing a true enclave, should make it
                                    possible for the United States to press for continued exclusive
                                    control of the Ryukyus as a legitimate political cost of US
                                    defense commitments to Japan. The US Government should continue
                                    to emphasize to the Government of Japan that Japan's security is
                                    in large part dependent on the maintenance of a substantial US
                                    military posture in the Ryukyus. The Government of Japan, for
                                    its part, should continue its efforts to bridge diverse
                                    attitudes among the Japanese people concerning basic security
                                    issues and should seek to create popular support for the thesis
                                    that Japan's security, together with that of the rest of the
                                    free nations in east Asia, is largely dependent on credible US
                                    military presence in the Pacific. Such presence, in turn, is
                                    dependent on continued unrestricted US control of its bases and

                            interpret as progress toward reversion. I do not interpret the areas
                            which the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is exploring for closer
                            relations with Okinawa as an effort at whittling away of our basic
                            authority but as what the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> feels is a
                            minimum necessary for the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to

                        <item>I also do not have any impression that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> does not intend to continue to cooperate as fully as it
                            can with us in maintaining our civil administration and unimpeded
                            operation of the bases. Its assets to influence the situation are,
                            however, limited in present circumstances and they see the desirability
                            of increasing their involvement not only for domestic political reasons
                            but also to facilitate our role. They find it to their advantage also to
                            have Okinawa remain quiet.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>As it does not seem to me that the consensus process will permit us to
                            reach a “solution” to the Okinawa problem in time to influence the
                            elections 1968 (para 4 reftel), it would seem to me desirable that we
                            give sympathetic consideration to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            proposals for such further participation in Okinawan affairs as it feels
                            will be helpful in meeting our common problems, rather than regarding
                            such proposals as bargaining levers which we can use to obtain what the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> cannot now give. I do not
                            suggest that we permit <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> involvement
                            which derogates from US administrative authority (I have been
                            categorically clear to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> on this), but
                            there are many areas which might be helpful and in line with our policy
                            guidelines.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>As for the Bonins, I do not see the prospects or desirability of
                            trying to use them as a bargaining counter in reaching an Okinawan
                            solution. It is not that kind of a situation and I do not feel it would
                            be to our advantage if we tried to make it such. The Japanese are well
                            aware of the marginal importance of the Bonins in our defense structure
                            and the sooner we are able to agree to reversion the more we establish a
                            credible rationale for our position on the Okinawan bases. While there
                            may be some whetting of appetites for reversion in Okinawa, if the
                            Bonins are returned, I am inclined to believe it will strengthen the
                            hands of those in both Japan and Okinawa advocating faith and conference
                            in US by demonstrating that we mean what we have said with respect to
                            returning these areas when the security situation permits. It is, of
                            course, not a question of removing our security installations on the
                            Bonins, but rather bringing them within the framework of our many
                            security installations within Japan.</item>

                            envisaged a scenario presenting the Japanese with a “bill of

                        <item>Our recommendation is that we inform the Japanese that we are prepared
                            to negotiate on reversion provided they give us advance commitments to
                            assure broad freedom of action for the use of U.S. bases, particularly
                            to support the Vietnam War, and to enlarge their political and economic
                            role in Asia. We have concluded that our prospects for reaching an
                            agreement with Japan on this basis will never be better than at the
                            present time. We also anticipate that actual return of the islands <pb

                        <p>We are confronted by a clear cut Japanese request to resolve the Ryukyus
                            and Bonins question by 1970. They wish to commence discussions now
                            looking to an early return of the Bonins and other Western Pacific
                            Islands to Japanese civil administration and a subsequent return of the
                            Ryukyus to Japanese civil administration under special arrangements
                            maintaining our military bases and satisfying our military requirements.
                            The Japanese are vague on the specific arrangements which would be
                            agreeable to them.</p>
                        <p>Before going ahead with further discussions with the Japanese, we need
                            your decisions on whether to commence negotiations with Japan on the
                            reversion of both groups of islands to Japanese civil control, and on
                            what prior commitments are required from Japan to make certain that
                            reversion does not compromise our essential security interests and our
                            capability to conduct the Vietnam War.</p>

                        <p>Okinawa, the principal island of the Ryukyus, is the most important U.S.
                            military base in the Western Pacific. Its value is enhanced by the
                            absence of any restrictions on our freedom of action. The availability
                            of the Okinawa base, close to potential theaters of operation, adds
                            substantially to overall U.S. capability and flexibility. The Bonins and
                            other Western Pacific Islands are of little or no importance militarily
                            but have been retained principally for contingency purposes.</p>
                        <p>At the present time, we exercise all civil and military authority on the
                            islands.</p>
                        <p>Japanese sovereignty over the Ryukyus and the other islands has been
                            recognized. The Japanese Government has cooperated up to now in keeping
                            reversionist sentiment in both Japan and the Ryukyus in check, but it is
                            under ever-increasing political and public pressure in both countries to
                            resolve this issue. Reversion is now the only major problem between
                            Japan and the United States.</p>

                            negotiations for the return of administration of these islands. They
                            have informed us that they want us to retain our military bases in the
                            Ryukyus and other islands, and that they are prepared in effect to
                            negotiate special arrangements which would enable us to meet our
                            military requirements and responsibilities in the area.</p>
                        <p>They would like the negotiations completed so as to permit the return by
                            1970. The date is significant. In that year the opposition will have its
                            first opportunity since 1960 to mount a campaign for the renunciation of
                            the Security Treaty and a repudiation of the Japanese-American alliance.
                            The opposition intends to make the U.S. occupation of the Ryukyus the
                            focal point of their attack.</p>

                        <p>Two major arguments are advanced for rejecting the Japanese request: <list>
                                <item>First, there is no need to change the status quo since our
                                    position there is still politically tenable.</item>
                                <item>Second, the status quo is essential on military
                                    grounds.</item>

                            below. We conclude that an effort to retain the current status of the
                            Ryukyus involves unacceptable and unnecessary risks. We also conclude
                            that it is timely and advantageous to enter into negotiations on return
                            of the Ryukyus and other islands provided the Japanese satisfy our
                            essential requirements, and in no way impair our freedom of action to
                            support the Vietnam War.</p>

                                    involved political risks. Until the present, these risks have
                                    been acceptable because reversionist pressures have been
                                    tolerable, and partially muted by effective U.S. administration
                                    and by Japanese and Ryukyuan cooperation with us. The Japanese

                                    Ryukyus.</p>
                                <p>We could remain in the Ryukyus on the present basis for a time,
                                    because reversionist pressures have not yet reached the boiling
                                    point. In these circumstances, the Japanese Government would
                                    reluctantly accede to our position, rather than force a major
                                    confrontation with us. But, it cannot hold to this position for
                                    long.</p>
                                <p>Reversionist pressures are mounting in both Japan and the
                                    Ryukyus. It is no longer a demand made solely by the opposition.
                                    More and more of our conservative friends in both areas are
                                    beginning to insist on it. The conservative leaders, therefore,
                                    sense that it is timely, it is vital to their political
                                    interests, and it is essential to Japan-American relations that
                                    this issue be soon resolved. Furthermore, the Japanese
                                    Government has concluded that security attitudes in Japan will
                                    now permit an accommodation with U.S. military requirements
                                    after reversion. An opportunity still remains for quiet
                                    negotiations free from uncompromising public demands.</p>
                                <p>The longer we delay negotiations the greater the danger that an
                                    explosive situation could develop.</p>
                                <p>We already face two potentially dangerous deadlines in the next
                                    three years. In the 1968 Ryukyu elections, the slim conservative
                                    majority could be lost and a far less cooperative left-wing
                                    government could take over. In 1970, the Security Treaty debate
                                    could bring irresistible pressures for reversion. The ensuing
                                    debate on the Treaty and reversion would have considerable
                                    bearing on the outcome of the next general election which must
                                    take place by January 1971.</p>
                                <p>The Soviets are poised to exploit the reversion issue. They sense
                                    the emotional content of the Ryukyu issue in Japan, and we have
                                    reports that they plan to offer to return some of the northern
                                    islands in order to put strains on Japanese-American
                                    relations.</p>
                                <p>If we wait until events force us to change our policies in the
                                    Ryukyus, and then reluctantly concede, we may gain a few more
                                    years. But we also risk serious strains on our relations with
                                    Japan, create difficulties for friendly Japanese Governments,
                                    and could conceivably jeopardize our base position in the
                                    Ryukyus.</p>

                                        <p>The Japanese Government would have to agree to allow the
                                            U.S. to mount operations in defense of Southeast Asia
                                            and Taiwan without prior consultation. This is to be
                                            certain that reversion will not in any way limit our
                                            needed freedom of operations for Vietnam or other
                                            possible contingencies.</p>
                                        <p>During the Vietnam War, we have not mounted combat
                                            operations directly from Okinawa except for several
                                            instances when B–52s were forced by typhoons to seek
                                            haven in the Ryukyus and subsequently launched missions
                                            to Vietnam from there. As for the future, we would not
                                            need to mount conventional combat operations directly
                                            from Okinawa unless we wished to engage in conventional
                                            bombing of the Chinese mainland, which is not
                                            likely.</p>
                                        <p>We are not certain that the Japanese Government is
                                            prepared to grant us this freedom of action. But, this
                                            right to use the Ryukyu bases without consultation is
                                            important not only as a safeguard for contingencies, but
                                            as a means of associating Japan with our efforts in
                                            Vietnam, and making certain that there will be no
                                            restrictions on essential combat operations for
                                            Vietnam.</p>

                                        <p>The issue of nuclear weapons on Okinawa is likely to be
                                            the major obstacle to an agreement on special
                                            arrangements. The Japanese have indicated serious
                                            concern about the acceptability in Japan of permitting
                                            nuclear weapons to remain on Okinawa after reversion.
                                            The Department of Defense has studied the question of
                                            the importance of maintaining nuclear weapons on
                                            Okinawa. The Secretary of Defense <pb n="196"
                                                xml:id="pg_196" facs="0232"/>has concluded that
                                            because the U.S. arsenal of nuclear weapons at other
                                            locations in the Pacific is sufficient for
                                            contingencies, and because we could resupply speedily
                                            weapons from the U.S. if necessary, there would be no
                                            significant degradation of our capability if we removed
                                            all of our nuclear weapons from Okinawa.</p>
                                        <p>The nuclear issue has an additional aspect. There is an
                                            outside possibility that some Japanese officials and
                                            political leaders may yet be prepared to agree to
                                            nuclear storage after reversion in order to accustom the
                                            Japanese people to the presence of nuclear weapons, and
                                            thus facilitate a Japanese nuclear weapons program
                                            should they decide to undertake one. Our efforts to
                                            discourage the Japanese from going nuclear would be
                                            enhanced if we removed nuclear weapons from Okinawa
                                            prior to reversion. This would still leave us with the
                                            right to storage subject to consultation, as is now the
                                            case in Japan itself. We are therefore prepared to

                                        <p>There are certain other operations which we carry on from
                                            Okinawa and not from Japan. These include the mounting
                                            of clandestine operations and the maintenance of a VOA
                                            transmitter. We believe that we can negotiate an
                                            agreement that would give us greater latitude in these
                                            matters on Okinawa than we have on the Japanese
                                            mainland. These rights would be embodied in a special
                                            base rights agreement to be negotiated at the time of
                                            reversion.</p>

                                <p>The timing is favorable. If we move now on reversion, we
                                    demonstrate an American sensitivity to the concerns of our
                                    allies, an ability to forge new and constructive relations with
                                    our allies, and an ability to deal in advance with potentially
                                    dangerous problems. We will have dealt, in a most timely manner,
                                    with the only important and serious issue between ourselves and
                                    Japan.</p>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>It is our judgment that our bargaining position will never be better than
                            it is now. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s political
                            position is strong enough to put across a deal favorable to us on the
                            Ryukyus. He is securely in power for the next few years, having survived
                            in January a major threat to his continued rule. If we begin
                            negotiations immediately, we have very good prospects for getting all
                            the special base rights that we need, plus a Japanese commitment to
                            greater regional responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>There is always the possibility that <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> will not be able to accept our conditions for
                            reversion. But, in this event, our proposal will place responsibility
                            for delaying reversion squarely on the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>Return of the Ryukyus will also act as a powerful incentive on Japan to
                            undertake broader responsibilities in Asia. The Japanese are <pb n="197"
                                xml:id="pg_197" facs="0233"/>already making an increasing
                            contribution, particularly to the economic development of the
                            non-Communist countries in the region. Return of the Ryukyus will by
                            itself draw Japan into an expanded regional role and inevitably
                            necessitate increased military activities for the defense of this area.
                            But, the Japanese should be urged to do substantially more. The Japanese
                            are not ready yet to play a military role in regional security and we
                            doubt whether most other Asian countries would welcome this at this
                            time. However, if we are going to carry most of the military burden,
                            they should carry a heavier economic burden. One of the prices paid by
                            Japan for reversion should be greater Japanese economic aid to East
                            Asia.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We consider that retention of these islands has little military
                            justification. The U.S. does not now maintain any major regional
                            installations on these islands and we have no current plans for any new
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>We propose to negotiate the return of these islands as a package with the
                            Ryukyus. However, if it is decided not to negotiate on the Ryukyus, we
                            should agree to a prior return of the Bonins in an effort to try to
                            stem, for a time, pressures for reversion of the Ryukyus.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Return of administration over the Ryukyus and other islands can be
                            accomplished, as was done with several Ryukyuan Islands in 1953, by an
                            Executive Agreement accompanied by a base rights agreement probably with
                            some secret annexes. We anticipate that there will be Congressional
                            opposition to reversion, particularly to return of Iwo Jima and, for
                            this reason, propose to retain the whole island as a military base.
                            However, we believe that there will be substantial support for this
                            action provided Japan makes the commitments recommended below and it is
                            clear that there will be no detrimental effects on our war effort in
                            Vietnam.</p>

                    <p>He asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to summarize
                        the current situation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said it was in our vital
                        interest to keep Japan a willing partner in the free world and to get them
                        to carry the larger share of the common load. Japan soon will be the third
                        most industrial power in the world. Their help in Viet-Nam has been quiet
                        but important. They have been helping in aid to Asia but should do more.
                        Japan's aid <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0236"/>now represents .65% of
                        the gross national product; the Japanese are aiming at 1%. The Secretary
                        said the coming visit of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> would provide a good opportunity to raise this
                        question.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary recalled that under the Truman Administration, he was one of
                        those who favored an early return of the Southern Islands to Japan. He said
                        he was not so anxious to see that now. He reviewed the Security Treaty
                        problem and Japan's constitutional difficulty with any military commitment.
                        He noted the Security Treaty would become subject to revision. The Secretary
                        said that if the Defense Department felt that we urgently need the Islands
                        to carry out our Asian commitments, they would get no argument from the
                        Secretary of State. He noted that there will be elections in the Ryukyu
                        Islands in 1968 and some forward movement toward reversion would have a
                        favorable effect. He said Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> would
                        discuss some interim steps in that direction. He said that we did not want
                        to revise the Security Treaty and that the Japanese Government doesn't seem
                        to want that either. He said that things to be decided were: <list>

                    </p>
                    <p>He thought that action on the Bonin Islands would take much heat out of the
                        Ryukyus question.</p>

                            <item>This issue is not being artificially created by the Japanese
                                Government. The political situation in Japan and in the Ryukyus is

                    </p>
                    <p>One reason this has received so much attention is that it is “the last
                        remaining issue” between Japan and the United States. Also, the Japanese
                        find it “unnatural” for Japanese territory to be run by an American
                        General.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador underlined that Japan did not want to stir up the issue but
                        wanted to keep it under control.</p>
                    <p>There were two principal questions: <list>

                    <p>On interim steps, the Ambassador suggested two possibilities: <list>

                    </p>
                    <p>The President asked what we would get out of this.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> said that in the Ryukyus, without
                        positive steps, we could get a hostile government.</p>
                    <p>The President said he wanted to know in all of this—on bases and the
                        Ryukyus—what was in it for the United States. He said we always seem to
                        think of what is necessary or good for others.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> said he thought we could get Japan to
                        assume greater responsibilities for security in the Far East. It was not
                        realistic to think of military assistance from Japan, but it was realistic
                        to think of Japan's playing a greater political role. He said we needed to
                        involve them more with us in Asia.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if Japan could do more economically to assist with our
                        balance of payments problem. Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> said he
                        was sure the Japanese would do more in Asia. He was not sure of balance of
                        payments.</p>
                    <p>The President said he wanted a list of the things we hoped to get from the
                            Japanese.<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">See <ref target="#d94">Documents

                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> said he thought the
                        balance of payments problems should be kept separate from the Ryukyus
                        question. He thought the United States should propose a balance of payments
                        committee. The committee would, among other things, carry out joint
                        accounting of the balance of payments and that this should include military
                        transactions.</p>
                    <p>Second, he would stress joint US and Japanese planning of military
                        expenditures. He noted that in Japan, plans for 2.8 to 2.9 billion dollars
                        was earmarked for military equipment. He thought there would <pb n="202"
                            xml:id="pg_202" facs="0238"/>be an element of competitive bidding and of
                        shared production. A reasonable share of the proposed outlay (up to
                        one-third) would still defer only part of our unfavorable balance. He raised
                        the desirability of increasing Japan's role in regional cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he was not
                        much concerned about the reversion problem. He said the issue was: should we
                        maintain our bases there? What are the arguments for keeping bases? As for
                        the Treaty, should we extend it in 1970?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said by and large the Japanese were “standing aside” and taking
                        “pot shots” at us. The nuclear threat in that area was not to us but to
                        Japan. He thought the Japanese were going to have to convince us that we
                        should keep the bases.</p>
                    <p>The President noted that Senator Mansfield was going to Japan and other Far
                        East points to make lectures. He asked for one page memos which would list
                        some of the things he might discuss with Senator Mansfield before the
                        latter's departure.<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4">The memorandum from <persName

                        Japanese help to us in Viet-Nam was a secret, and should not be

                    <p>As for Japanese criticism, he noted that the voting record of Japan with us
                        in international bodies was as good as any country in the world.</p>
                    <p>General <persName>Johnson</persName> said the Joint Chiefs position on
                        Okinawa was very simple: we have commitments in Asia and we must have
                        unrestricted uses of Okinawa as long as we have those commitments.</p>

                        of a “mid way point” regarding administration with a Japanese civilian and a
                        United States General sharing administrative responsibilities. The President
                        asked whether a civilian administrator would help the problem.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> said he thought this was no answer
                        and didn't get at the heart of the problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> mentioned the “enclave” idea for US bases but
                        said it was an impossible situation since the bases are widely scattered and
                        mixed into non-base areas.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> asked what percentage of Japan's gross

                                “reversion”—they relate to fundamental issues of U.S. and Japanese
                                foreign and defense policy. The basic question is not “should the
                                Ryukyus ’revert‘ to Japan,” but rather “will the U.S. Congress and

                        allow our nation to “stand alone” in the far Pacific; our bases in that area
                        are there at least as much for the protection of the Japanese as they are
                        for the defense of the United States; and, it will be impossible for us to
                        maintain those bases unless the Japanese move gradually to share the very
                        heavy political and economic costs of providing security to the area.</p>

                    <p>In response to your request at the National Security Council meeting
                        yesterday, I am attaching my views of what the United States should be
                        saying to the Japanese in forthcoming meetings, beginning with the September
                        13–15 Joint Cabinet Meetings.</p>
                    <p>It is important that we pursue these balance of payments objectives with
                        Japan independently and separately, regardless of what may evolve in
                        negotiations over the Ryukyu Islands.</p>
                    <p>The time has passed for general discussion with Japan of balance of payments
                        cooperation, and we should make the specific points set forth in the
                        attached paper.</p>

                                    the $2.8–2.9 billion in the Five Year Defense Plan earmarked for

                                of probably at least 65%). Such measures would expand current

                    <p>You have asked for my views on what we want from the Japanese with more
                        specific reference to the upcoming Cabinet-level talks:</p>
                    <p>Fundamentally, we want Japan as a partner—not as a rival—in Asia, but as
                        partner sharing the political and economic burdens of regional
                        responsibility. While we do not now seek a greater Japanese military role,
                        other than in its own defense, Japan's actions should contribute to—and not
                        detract from—effective fulfillment of our military and security commitments
                        to Asia. This is particularly true of any solution to the Ryukyus and Bonins
                        issues.</p>

                    <p>During the talks with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MT3"
                            >Miki</persName> and his Cabinet colleagues, I would propose to: <list>
                            <item>—Adopt largely a “listening brief” on the Ryukyus and Bonins,
                                leaving the way open for more conclusive talks with Prime Minister
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> in mid-November but
                                pointing the Japanese in the direction of interim steps to reduce
                                disparities between Okinawa and Japan and thus to ease our problems
                                of the 1968 Ryukyu elections and Japanese public opinion.</item>
                            <item>—Spell out the heavy burden we now shoulder for both the security
                                and economic development of Asia.</item>
                            <item>—Press the Japanese to take on a greater share of regional
                                leadership and the financial burden of economic assistance and of
                                redressing the imbalance in our balance of payments.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>In more specific terms, the major objectives I would currently seek from the
                        Japanese: <list>
                            <item>—Support on key United Nations issues and possibly a role in
                                United Nations peacekeeping in the Middle East if this
                                materializes.</item>
                            <item>—Continued support and responsible action on Vietnam, with greater
                                economic aid to the Government of Vietnam.</item>
                            <item>—Adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</item>
                            <item>—Matching contributions on major East Asian economic development
                                programs, including the Asian Development Bank Special Funds.</item>
                            <item>—Significant reduction in our bilateral balance of payments
                                deficit which results in part from increased military-related
                                expenditures in Japan during the Vietnam conflict.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Basically, what we want and need is a still more mature and responsible
                        attitude on the part of Japan towards the threat posed by the Chinese
                        Communists and by the internal instability of the countries on the periphery
                        of China. Japan has a greater stake than we do in countering this threat. It
                        should understand that our ability to maintain continued support from
                        Congress and the American public for our own commitments in Asia could
                        depend on Japan's assuming responsibilities commensurate with its stake in
                        regional security and stability.</p>

                                    <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> desires “one step forward on
                                    reversion.” <persName corresp="#p_ST5">Shimoda</persName>
                                    pointed out that Kennedy–<persName corresp="#p_IH3"

                                    in Far East and easing of tensions. However, nobody knows when
                                    tensions will ease in Far East, particularly given China
                                    situation and tensions could continue for long time, in fact
                                    indefinitely. As result, there could be sense of impatience and
                                    frustration on part Japanese with unfortunate impact on
                                    US-Japanese friendship particularly as a result left-wing

                            generally correct with the following additional comments. First, with
                            respect to Ryukyu reversion, four points made by <persName
                                corresp="#p_ST5">Shimoda</persName> correctly reflect US views.
                            Additionally, <persName>Bundy</persName> pointed out importance of
                            discussing regional security problem in broader sense as it related to
                            reversion of Okinawa. There are both practical problems involved in
                            reversion [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines of source text not

                            important to consider impact on US public and Congress of public
                            discussions of reversion while we currently involved in intensive phase
                            of Vietnam hostilities. <persName>Bundy</persName> referred to
                            discussions between <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> and
                            Secretary on timing factor in Ryukyu reversion, specifically 1968
                            Okinawa elections, security treaty review in 1970 and understandable
                            desire not to have both this and Ryukyu problems acute at same time, and
                            US elections which any US President must be mindful of in considering
                            major new foreign policy actions. He concluded that given Vietnam

                            concerned whether action on this issue would be considered step forward
                            or would instead increase public pressures in Japan for Ryukyu
                            reversion. He also confirmed desire consider Iwo in separate

                        when United States-Japan relations are at a high point. They are seriously
                        clouded only by the unresolved territorial issues of the Ryukyus and Bonins,
                        but even here there is recognition of the need to resolve these issues
                        without acrimony and with due regard to the problems involved for both
                        countries and the need to strengthen our bilateral relationship. <persName

                    </p>
                    <p>Our major problems during the visit will be twofold. First, we will need to
                        obtain, in more concrete terms, commitments from the Japanese on picking up
                        a greater share of the financial burden for regional assistance and
                        redressing the imbalance of our bilateral balance of payments. Secondly, we
                        will need to work out a formula for tidying over <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213"
                            facs="0249"/>the difficult territorial issues. The Japanese apparently
                        recognize that we are not now in a position to make any firm commitment on
                        reversion of the Ryukyus, but they want a “step forward”—the terms of which
                        are still to be worked out. The Japanese would, however, like a commitment
                        on the early return of the Bonins, an issue still to be resolved within our
                            Government.<note n="4" xml:id="d98fn4">The resolution of the reversion
                            issue generated several high-level meetings and various proposals and

                    <p>The situation is very fluid in Japan on this subject just now, and Ambassador

                        <p>The major issues we anticipate during the visit of Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> will be twofold: First,
                            Japanese willingness to shoulder a greater share of the political and
                            economic burdens of regional responsibility; and second, our response to
                            Japanese desires for forward movement on reversion of the Ryukyu and
                            Bonin Islands.</p>
                        <p>In preparation for the <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> visit,
                            I stressed to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MT3"
                                >Miki</persName> in mid-September the actions we sought from Japan
                            as a contributing partner in the region and our inability primarily for
                            security reasons to make a commitment at this time on the return of the
                            Ryukyus. At <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName>'s request, I said
                            we would give serious consideration to reversion of the Bonin Islands in
                            the near future but in this event Iwo Jima would have to be treated as a
                            special case.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese have responded very positively to my talks with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName>. Both <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> have
                            come out with strong statements of support on our Vietnam policies,
                            particularly on the bombing issue, and <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> during his two trips through Asia has begun to
                            exercise the regional leadership we seek from Japan. Furthermore, the
                            Japanese leaders have made concerted efforts to dampen down expectations

                            of our military position on Okinawa to their own and regional

                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> informs me that he expects

                            increased assistance to Southeast Asia and on our balance of payments
                            problem, if we can be responsive to his desire for forward steps on the
                            Ryukyus and particularly the Bonins to help stem reversionist pressures.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> faces increasingly heavy
                            political and public demands to obtain substantial progress in the

                            response from us will be politically damaging to him and could lead to
                            serious problems in our relations with Japan as well as with the local
                            populace in the Ryukyus. In the Ambassador's views, the key factor will
                            be our willingness to enter into negotiations for return of the Bonins
                            and he has requested earliest guidance on this matter before undertaking

                            motion in this area. We are therefore proposing (1) interim steps which
                            would not involve any further commitment on our part to Ryukyu
                            reversion, but would slightly change the public formula on reversion and
                            would provide for further identification of the Ryukyuan people with
                            Japan and (2) agreement to subsequent periodic review of the status of
                            the islands in light of the related security problems.<note n="7"

                        <p>At present the United States has few military installations in the
                            Bonins. Military personnel as of June 30, 1967 totaled 77 (33 Navy and
                            44 Air Force), plus 3 United States civilians and 55 foreign-national
                            civilians employed by the Navy. The principal installations are: (1) a
                            naval facility on Chichi Jima used to support patrolling operations in
                            the Philippine Sea; (2) a stand-by airfield on Iwo Jima capable of
                            supporting major operations; (3) a smaller airfield on Marcus Island;
                            (4) a weather reporting facility; and, (5) a stand-by nuclear weapons
                            storage facility (details on United States installations are
                            enclosed).</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff would prefer to retain administrative rights
                            over the Bonins for contingency purposes and until the political status
                            of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands is resolved. As a fallback
                            position, they would agree to return all the Bonin Islands except Iwo
                            Jima and Chichi Jima, and to consult with the Japanese on the military
                            utility of these two islands to Japan and the United States. Since most
                            of the Bonin Islanders now residing in Japan had lived in Chichi Jima,
                            retention of this island would create serious problems in Japan.
                            Retention of the naval facility in Chichi Jima under the Security Treaty
                            provisions and of the whole island of Iwo Jima as an emergency stand-by
                            base could, however, serve to meet our contingency requirements. To
                            emphasize that return of the Bonins represents a step toward shared
                            responsibility for the region, it is also proposed to seek Japanese
                            agreement to assume larger defense responsibilities in the area, while
                            agreeing to our retention of other stand-by facilities as required.</p>
                        <p>Retention of Iwo Jima as a military base is also recommended because of
                            anticipated adverse public reaction in this country to its <pb n="217"
                                xml:id="pg_217" facs="0253"/>return. However, the Japanese in
                            preliminary talks with us have strongly resisted our retention of Iwo
                            Jima and suggested instead a United States memorial park on Mount
                            Surabachi. Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> is concerned that
                            retention of Iwo Jima could significantly detract from the value of
                            Bonins reversion unless we can make a strong case on security
                            grounds.</p>

                        more likely that the Japanese would refuse nuclear storage in Okinawa.
                        Additionally, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> are reluctant to
                        accept at this time the Japanese offer to assume major defense

                        any way prejudice our case for insisting on nuclear storage in the Ryukyus.
                        A request for nuclear storage rights on islands where we now maintain very
                        small bases and only 77 military personnel would hardly be understandable to

                        in fact, a marginal position, is an old view deep in the Pentagon; namely,
                        that to make any concession to the Japanese with respect to the Ryukyus and
                        Bonins is to put us on a slippery slope. The fact is that the old,
                        immediately pre-war relationship is changing and must change. Our objective
                        can only now be a gradual and judicious transition into a new relationship
                        in which the Japanese take increased responsibility as a partner as we alter
                        the essentially occupation status on the islands. At the moment they are
                        assuming more partnership responsibility in aid and monetary affairs; and
                        they should do more. The transition to military partnership will take
                        longer.</p>

                            with a view to the early return of administration of the Bonin Islands

                        <p>In the light of the proposal of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to preserve a
                            right to store nuclear weapons on Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I have reviewed
                            the possibility that an exception should be made, for purposes of the
                            communiqué, regarding these two islands. We have noted that the general
                            language in our proposal would in any event permit us to negotiate for
                            the retention of appropriate “military facilities and areas” on these
                            islands or any other part of the Bonins. The language on this point has
                            been strengthened since the matter was discussed with you on October
                                31.<note n="6" xml:id="d100fn6">The matter was discussed at the

                        </p>
                        <p>In the light of this strengthened language, our conclusion is that the
                            proposal fully protects whatever military needs we wish to retain. We
                            believe that to exempt Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima from the overall
                            principle of return of administration to Japan is not required for any
                            foreseeable military purpose.</p>
                        <p>In reaching this conclusion we have given particular weight to the
                            question of possible nuclear storage in the Bonins. We do not now
                            station any nuclear weapons there, and do not have any plans to do so.
                            We therefore do not believe that it should be necessary to press for
                            retaining the right for nuclear storage in working out the return of
                            administration to Japan. Nor do we believe that failure to achieve such
                            rights would in any way prejudice our serious case for insisting, at
                            some point, on a right of nuclear storage in the Ryukyus. Furthermore,
                            even if we were to so conclude in the future, the general language in
                            the attached proposal would permit us to negotiate the matter with
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I thus
                            conclude that the language in the attached proposal fully protects our
                            military needs and is a wise and essential move at this time in the
                            overall framework of our relations with Japan, including our desire to
                            obtain more firm Japanese support on Vietnam and favorable action by
                            Japan particularly with respect to our balance of payments problems.</p>

                        <p>The President and Prime Minister also reviewed the status of the Bonin
                            Islands and agreed that the mutual security interests of Japan and the
                            United States could be accommodated within the arrangements for the

                                >GOJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>They, therefore, agreed that the two Governments will enter immediately
                            into consultation regarding the specific arrangements for accomplishing
                            the early restoration of these islands to Japan without detriment to the
                            security of the area. These consultations will take into account the
                            intention of the Japanese Government, expressed by the Prime Minister,
                            gradually to assume much of the responsibility for defense of the area.
                            The President and Prime Minister agreed that the United States would
                            retain such military facilities and areas in the Bonin Islands as
                            required in the mutual security of both countries.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister stated that the return of the administrative rights
                            over the Bonin Islands would not only contribute to solidifying the ties
                            of friendship between the two countries but would also help to reinforce
                            the conviction of the Japanese people that the return of the
                            administrative rights over the Ryukyu Islands will also be solved within
                            the framework of mutual trust between the two countries.</p>

                            security problems of Japan and Asia than they were on the simple

                            these three points fully. He had, indeed, argued with Prime Minister

                            time to raise the issue of the Ryukyus. He said that Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> also understood these
                            three points; but he was faced with a rising and passionate political

                    <p>The U.S. has taken an initiative for balance of payments cooperation with
                        Japan which is of major importance to U.S. financial ability to maintain the
                        U.S. military security posture in the Far East. The U.S. has proposed to
                        Japan that certain points be submitted to you and Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> for approval when he visits Washington
                        November 14–15. I believe that it is of major importance to the overall U.S.
                        balance of payments program that you obtain the Prime Minister's approval of
                        these points. (See Attachment A; <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                        will probably state the views shown in parentheses under each point in the

                    <p>Specifically, <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> will not be able to
                        undertake a commitment now to reach the $500 million goal of balance of
                        payments assistance insofar as that includes the purchase of special
                        medium-term U.S. paper in the amount of $200 million. Our supplementary
                        memorandum suggests that, while recognizing that he cannot give you this
                        commitment now, you urge him to keep the matter open for further technical
                        discussion between the two Finance Ministeries.</p>
                    <p>Also, that you emphasize the concept of maintaining the long term financial
                        viability of our security posture in the Far East.</p>
                    <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0262"/>
                    <p>Also, that you do not accept any linkage of Japanese action on our balance of
                        payments in exchange for U.S. action respecting the Bonin and Ryukyu
                        Islands.</p>
                    <p>These observations are developed briefly below.</p>
                    <p>The topic of Japanese reversionary rights to the Bonin and the Ryukyu Islands
                        will also be a major subject during the <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> visit. I anticipate that <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> may say to you that the amount of their balance of
                        payments cooperation depends on how much we satisfy their objectives for
                        control over the Islands.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you make clear to <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                        that the U.S. does not link the substance of these two matters. Japan is not
                        being asked to cooperate on the overall U.S. balance of payments program in
                        exchange for some U.S. action respecting the Bonin and the Ryukyu Islands.
                        To the extent possible, I believe each matter should be examined and decided
                        on its own merits.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you emphasize to <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                        that balance of payments cooperation is particularly important to our
                        financial ability to provide the defense shield under which the Pacific
                        basin can develop. Our military deployments and heavy foreign exchange
                        expenditures in the Pacific area are necessary for our security <hi
                            rend="italic">and</hi> Japan's, although we do not view U.S. military
                        forces in Japan as being there primarily for the defense of Japan. These
                        expenditures have brought large direct and indirect benefits to the Japanese
                        economy and balance of payments.</p>
                    <p>You may wish to emphasize to <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> that
                        no one country should suffer undue costs or gain undue benefits from
                        expenditures for the common security, and that these expenditures should be
                        recognized as an extraordinary item in U.S. accounts. I believe <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> should be led to recognize that
                        neutralizing these extraordinary security expenditures is a prime motivation
                        for the U.S. seeking balance of payments cooperation from Japan—even though
                        there is agreement that the matter cannot be discussed publicly at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>Treasury representatives will be meeting with Japanese officials on Thursday,
                        November 16 (the day after you conclude your sessions with <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>) in order to expedite follow-up action.
                        I hope that arrangements can be made for me to have the benefit of any
                        conclusions you may reach with <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> so
                        that the November 16 meeting can proceed effectively.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Balance of Payments</hi>. In opening the
                                substantive conversation Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                    >Sato</persName> said he understood the U.S. hoped Japan would
                                help out in the balance of payments problem by providing $500
                                million temporary assistance; he could say that $300 million was
                                possible. <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0264"/>The new
                                subcommittee on balance of payments might well study the problem. He
                                noted that the situation in Germany was different in that Germany
                                held much greater reserves, and he hoped the U.S. would understand
                                this difference. It would be particularly difficult to put much into
                                medium term bonds. Japan's holdings of foreign exchange were down
                                from $2 billion to $1.9 billion, and bond purchases would cause this
                                amount to decrease further.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary agreed that the subcommittee should study the problem.
                                The question of foreign exchange offset was not the primary concern
                                of the Secretary of Defense, but he was interested because of the
                                political implications which affected foreign policy. The American
                                people were becoming more restive and unwilling to carry burdens by
                                themselves. The willingness of Japan to take some of the burden was
                                important, not only because of its financial effects, but because it
                                would show that Japan was truly participating in the defense of the
                                free world.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said Japan was not in
                                a position to intervene militarily or to extend military aid and he
                                was sure the U.S. understood this. In the financial area Japan would
                                like to do what it could and had indicated this in its support of
                                the Asian Development Bank and loans to Southeast Asia. Japan would
                                like to protect the pound and the dollar to the extent possible.
                                Japan could not, however, do all that was requested.</p>

                                    Vietnam</hi>. The Secretary said he was pleased to see Japan
                                expand its role in Asia and show growing interest in the Asian
                                Development Bank and other projects. He hoped that as the years went
                                by Japan would play a larger role. There was much criticism in the
                                U.S. of the Vietnam operation, in large part because the U.S. was
                                spilling blood in support of peace in the area. The American people
                                wanted to know why Japan, India, and Western Europe did not believe
                                it important to contribute. We understood why Japan does not play a
                                military role, but the American people do not. He hoped that Japan
                                would work toward a greater political and economic role and,
                                ultimately, a military role in Asia.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he agreed. In the
                                course of his recent visits to Southeast Asia, he found everywhere
                                realization and appreciation of U.S. sacrifices to safeguard
                                freedom. It was generally agreed that the U.S. must stand firm until
                                peace was attained. Especially in the Philippines, Australia, and
                                New Zealand; all of which have sent troops to Vietnam, a majority
                                support the war. In Japan some elements were critical of the bombing
                                of North Vietnam, but this feeling was confined to a very small
                                group. He felt guilty about this sentiment in Japan, especially
                                toward the U.S. which was making such sacrifices. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he had to cut his visit to

                                    corresp="#p_NCK1">Ky</persName>. He was impressed with the
                                efforts to establish a democratic government. He was also deeply
                                impressed with the U.S. troop commitment, which was helping the
                                country while refraining from interference in the local affairs of
                                the Vietnamese.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary said he was pleased to hear this report. The Prime
                                Minister's statements represented exactly the kind of leadership
                                which was necessary. His visit to Vietnam was a courageous act,
                                which served to begin to convince the American people that Japan
                                associated itself with the U.S. effort. This was an invaluable step,
                                and he was grateful to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                    >Sato</persName> for taking it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he was
                                embarrassed by the Secretary's words of appreciation. He said that
                                he was aware that fear existed that the war would spread, but the
                                war in Vietnam was not a normal war. The U.S. could not go all out;
                                its hands were tied. This was a difficult way to wage war and, this
                                was why it dragged on and created uncertainty in the U.S. Foreign
                                Minister <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> and he were
                                searching for peace, but the difficulty was that any Japanese effort
                                might be interpreted as a sign of weakness. Nevertheless, they were
                                still trying to find some way to bring about peace.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">China and Japan's Security</hi>. The Secretary
                                asked how the Japanese people were reacting to China's nuclear
                                strength.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said that real
                                thinking Japanese were concerned, but he had to say that the masses
                                were not concerned. He felt the government had not done enough to
                                educate the masses, on whom the Socialists had made a deep
                                impression. The Japanese Constitution was called a “Peace
                                Constitution” and the Socialists told the people that it guaranteed
                                Japan could live in peace and safety. This gave a sense of false
                                security unrelated to what Red China might do.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said Japan's whole
                                security was based on its security arrangement with the U.S. The
                                Japanese were well protected by the U.S. nuclear umbrella and Japan
                                had no intention to make nuclear weapons. Three years ago the
                                President assured him that the U.S. was prepared to aid Japan
                                against any attack.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Ryukyus Reversion</hi>. The Secretary noted that the
                            President has said this many times. This related directly to the
                            question of the Ryukyus and the natural desire of the Japanese for
                            reversion. The <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0266"/>Secretary said
                            he would be frank and candid. The Ryukyus were bound to revert to Japan.
                            The question was not one of reversion but of bases and the Mutual
                            Security Treaty, as well as the President's statements about responding
                            to nuclear blackmail. These all carried unwritten assumptions that Japan
                            would act in a way which would permit the use of bases. Reversion was
                            certain, but what was uncertain was the role of bases. We could not
                            leave U.S. forces exposed and unable to operate effectively. Japan must
                            permit the U.S. to operate militarily in the Ryukyus in ways which might
                            ultimately involve operations requiring nuclear weapons to be placed
                            there and combat operations to be conducted from there. The Secretary
                            understood these were difficult problems for the Japanese people. It
                            would take time for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> to
                            educate his people. He wished to emphasize that the American people
                            would never allow the U.S. to operate in this area without the support,
                            that is the political acquiescence of Japan. Accordingly, the whole
                            package of bases and reversion was tied together and must be explored in
                            the light of the interests of the two countries. The American people
                            would not tolerate a continued U.S. presence without Japanese
                            support.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he fully understood the
                        Secretary's premises. As Prime Minister, it was his duty to give primary
                        consideration to the security of Japan and he wished to do so in a framework
                        of the security of Asia.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, it was the strong desire of the Japanese people and the one
                        million Japanese in Okinawa for reversion. This was easy to understand,
                        since for almost twenty-five years these islands have been under a foreign
                        government. These spontaneous feelings demanded a response, but security
                        needs and sentiment were not inconsistent and could be satisfied
                        simultaneously. If the return of Okinawa meant military weakness, this was
                        not desirable. He sought reversion which would not prejudice the security of
                        either country. The problem was not “now” but “how.” President
                            <persName>Chiang Kai Shek</persName> had told him that he felt safe
                        because of the U.S. presence in Okinawa, and he would be concerned if the
                        U.S. withdrew after reversion. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                        replied that this was not his objective and he had no intention to weaken
                        the security of the area. If, at some time in the not too distant future,
                        agreement could be reached on when reversion could take place, it would be
                        useful. If after reversion there were a need to strengthen bases, this could
                        be considered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> noted that there used to be a
                        clamor when nuclear submarines visited Japan but this had subsided and it
                        had now been agreed to permit the Enterprise to visit Japan. Unlike the
                        Socialists, his party was not opposed to the Security Treaty but based
                        Japan's security on it. He sought a return of the Ryukyus Islands but not at
                        the sacrifice <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0267"/>of weakening bases.
                        If the problem were mishandled, it could become serious and the mutual
                        objectives of Japan and the U.S. would not be attained. He thought that what
                        the U.S. and Japan could do was to agree that reversion was possible and
                        that the question of timing would rest on agreement of the two
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>It was too soon to talk about the use of nuclear weapons, or the free use of
                        bases, or the question of prior consultation. Technical problems such as
                        these could wait until agreement has been reached on the basic issue of when
                        and how reversion would take place. It might take some time, perhaps months
                        or longer, but he must give some hope to the people of Japan that reversion
                        was coming. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he might be
                        accused of showing bad judgment in tying the question to Vietnam or the
                        Chinese nuclear threat, but he must bring this up to respond to the
                        sentiment of the Japanese people.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he understood the Prime Minister's position. He realized
                        the desires of the Japanese people and understood the political pressures.
                        He was not prepared to discuss specific language, but could support
                        reversion under circumstances which did not reduce the U.S. capability to
                        fulfill its commitments under the Mutual Security Treaty and other
                        treaties.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> asked the Secretary to bear in
                        mind that sometimes he felt the Japanese were strange. There were strong
                        pressures on him in Japan against visiting the U.S. for fear he might come
                        back with commitments. There was strong feeling in Okinawa and Japan that he
                        should make an appeal based on the sentiment of the people. It was very
                        important to settle the issue in a wise and prudent manner and he hoped the
                        Secretary would appreciate his position. The main thing was to give hope
                        that would enable the people to cooperate more willingly in regard to
                        freedom of bases.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> said he would
                        like to add that, as the Prime Minister explained, the problem he faced in
                        regard to reversion was the need to obtain basic agreement before entering
                        into consultation to work out details. It was of the utmost importance for
                        the Prime Minister to obtain this agreement in the absence of which many
                        problems would arise. He hoped that the U.S. Government could respond to the
                        desires of the Japanese people.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that everybody understood the political pressures the
                        Prime Minister was under. We also understood that if we have bases there, we
                        must be able to operate them as necessary under the Treaty. We must work out
                        an equation of these sometimes contradictory objectives.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that the text which he handed the President very
                        explicitly stated that there must be agreement between the two governments
                        to carry out reversion. He was not insisting that a <pb n="232"
                            xml:id="pg_232" facs="0268"/>target date be pinpointed, such as 1970 or
                        1973, but that both sides agree. Even with agreement on such a basis, many
                        would say it is too vague and indefinite; nevertheless, it was necessary to
                        have a basic agreement. This involved not only Japan, but Korea, Taiwan, and
                        the Philippines, all of which relied on the U.S. presence and arrangements
                        in Okinawa that served to assure the security of the whole area.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said that he would
                        be brief in discussing the Ryukyus problem and wished to get immediately to
                        the communiqué language on this question. He said he had to take two factors
                        into account: first, the strong desire of the Japanese people for reversion,
                        and <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0269"/>second, his personal concerns
                        as Prime Minister with Japan's security interests. He personally felt that
                        military bases in the Ryukyus could be strengthened by reversion since Japan
                        would be forced to live up to its security responsibilities by this action.
                        At the same time, mishandling of this issue could lead to dire consequences.
                        The Socialists will exploit such mishandling to their advantage. The
                        Communists will also. It is therefore important and necessary to work out
                        the problem.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out that the two
                        governments are closer to agreement on the Ryukyus than public opinion in
                        both countries, but both governments must deal with their differing public
                        opinions. The U.S. is in a sensitive position for several reasons. First,
                        anything appearing to weaken our position in Vietnam would be badly received
                        by the public and Congress. Second, Chinese Communist nuclear power has
                        added a new dimension to our security commitments to Japan, Korea and other
                        nations. As a result of this development, these commitments—which we accept
                        and are prepared to carry out—are of a much graver character than previously
                        anticipated. Third, there are constitutional limitations on what commitments
                        a President can make in terms of his successor, given the forthcoming 1968
                        Presidential elections. Even if President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                            >Johnson</persName> is reelected (to which <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> indicated his full support and expectation), a
                        commitment beyond the election date would provide a false issue to his
                        opponent.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, it is necessary to find communiqué language tolerable both to U.S.
                        political problems and to <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s
                        political problems. In conclusion, the Secretary emphasized that the U.S.
                        approaches this problem from the viewpoint of US-Japan friendship and
                        cooperation, not as adversaries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he understood the American
                        problem fully, particularly as long as the Vietnam conflict continues. He
                        recognized the Presidential election problem and mentioned that his own term
                        expires in December, 1968. Nevertheless, he hoped that we could agree on a
                        step forward which would not ignore the pressure of public opinion in his
                        own country. He felt that both the U.S. and Japan, in Japan's case as long
                        as the Liberal Democratic Party is in power, would follow their traditional
                        foreign policy whatever the results of elections.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said the fourth factor
                        facing the United States was the need to act with the understanding of
                        Congressional leaders whether or not specific legislation is involved. Our
                        soundings with Congress have indicated that, while there is considerable
                        understanding of Japan's problems, the Congressional sense is not to take
                        any dramatic movement on the Ryukyus for immediate reversion. We feel it is
                        necessary, therefore, that the communiqué language not build up any illusion
                        of a dramatic change or stimulate agitation which could lead to difficulties
                        when hoped for actions do not materialize.</p>
                    <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0270"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he appreciated the need for
                        careful handling of Congress. Nevertheless, he hoped we could give the
                        Japanese people some hope that U.S. administration of the Ryukyus is not to
                        be semi-permanent. The question of administrative rights ought also to be
                        separated from the status of U.S. military bases, just as in Europe. He is
                        not talking of immediate reversion, or even reversion within the next few
                        years, but agreement within a few years on a time for reversion. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> then proposed the following
                        language:</p>
                    <p>“The President and the Prime Minister agreed to make efforts to reach, in a
                        few years, agreement on a date satisfactory to the two governments on the
                        return of administrative rights to Japan.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> felt that this language
                        would build up an anticipation of too rapid reversion. He pointed to other
                        steps we are prepared to take during the visit to assist <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> with his domestic political problems,
                        particularly on the Bonins and interim measures such as the Advisory
                        Committee. The Secretary then proposed the U.S. language which was later
                        incorporated without change into the first two paragraphs of paragraph VII
                        of the communiqué.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> requested a few minutes to
                        consider the language proposed by the Secretary and retired with his
                        advisors to another part of the room. After about 15 minutes, <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> returned and informed the Secretary
                        that his language was acceptable, stating it was “taihen kekko” (very good).
                        He was clearly very pleased with the U.S. language.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> then raised the problem of
                        organizing early consultations on the Bonins, expressing the hope that we
                        could meet shortly on this issue. The Secretary agreed that we could begin
                        discussions shortly after the Ambassador returned and expressed the hope
                        that we could conclude the negotiations quickly. He assured <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> that we had no intention of delaying
                        the negotiations and that it was now a matter of working out the details.
                        After some discussion it was agreed that we would state publicly that we
                        hoped to conclude the negotiations within a year, and sooner if
                        possible.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> suggested the possibility of a
                        subcommittee for joint review of Ryukyu reversion. This was rejected and it
                        was agreed that no special committee would be needed, but that experts would
                        be brought in as required.</p>

                    <p>The Prime Minister thanked the President for the State dinner given him last
                        evening and expressed his and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName>'s appreciation for the gift presented by the President.
                        The President said that the Prime Minister had made many new friends for
                        Japan as a result of this visit, including the 200 guests at the State
                        dinner, who represented almost all 50 states.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister thanked the President for creating the mood of sincerity
                        that had marked his several meetings in Washington.</p>
                    <p>He had enjoyed full and frank exchanges of views with both Secretary

                        developed during these meetings was excellent. He said that he wished the

                    <p>The President said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        believes that the draft communiqué would probably meet with the approval of
                        Congress and probably would not be attacked.<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">

                            Country File, Japan, Vol. VII)</note> He said he wished to go as far in
                        the Pacific as he could in assisting the peoples of Asia and the Pacific to
                        improve their lives. Although formerly some Americans had shown prejudice
                        against Japan, he said he felt that this has been largely overcome and that
                        he can go as far as the draft communiqué without coming under Congressional
                        attack. He did not wish to have Congressmen <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236"
                            facs="0272"/>criticizing Japan. However, he had not had ample
                        opportunity to review the latest draft because he had spent most of the day
                        meeting with General <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President said that one great problem we have is that the Constitution of
                        Japan forbids her to send troops to Southeast Asia. Still, almost everything
                        we Americans buy is imported from Japan, such as shirts, textiles, radios
                        and television sets. On the economic side, however, such Southeast Asian
                        nations as Singapore, Laos, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia and the Philippines
                        all insist that an American withdrawal from Southeast Asia would spell their
                        doom but when asked what they can do they are unable to help the United
                        States effort there. Therefore, there are wonderful things for the Asian
                        Development Bank to do, under its able President who is a Japanese. Japan is
                        now equal to the strong nations and can do its part and provide the
                        leadership, even though this may be limited to sound financial assistance.
                        If the United States can make this great effort 10,000 miles from home why
                        can't Japan make an effort in her own area? Japan's significant contribution
                        to the <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss> had the same effect on American
                        opinion as a goodwill mission. The Koreans have impressed the American
                        people with their growth and by the fact that they have sent troops to
                        Vietnam even though Japan cannot. We understand why Japan cannot do so.
                        Speaking quite frankly, said the President, is the only way to get things
                        done.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he is more deeply interested in the Asian-Pacific
                        region than any other President has ever been. He intends to lead the
                        American people in the effort to help develop the strength and power of the
                        region because this is the area where two out of every three human beings
                        alive today live. This is where the people are. However, this fiscal year
                        the United States is spending between $25 and $30 billion in the effort to
                        defend Vietnam. This is a great expenditure, year after year, but in
                        addition the United States has taken over 100,000 casualties, and has
                        expanded a great deal of blood and lives. A way must be found to enable
                        these people to do enough to help themselves.</p>
                    <p>Japan has helped considerably with the <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>.
                        Now that he has requested Congress for additional funds for the <gloss
                            target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>, however, Congress is asking why we must do
                        it all and what is Japan doing?<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">In September the
                            administration asked the Congress to authorize $200 million for the

                            >ADB</gloss>)</note> He said he understood that the Japanese people ask
                        why doesn't the United States provide more money, but the American people
                        ask why doesn't Japan? We wish to help Indonesia and can do so when Japan is
                        also ready to help. This is a big country here. We hope that Japan can help
                        on these <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0273"/>financial matters,
                        particularly since she cannot send men because of her Constitution.</p>
                    <p>There are two or three matters in which Japan can help, for example, balance
                        of payments. If the United States is willing to run a deficit of $30
                        billion, Japan should be willing to spend some money too. Why can't Japan
                        buy $500 million in medium-term securities? Germany is willing to help.
                        Japan can't send men, but it would seem that she could provide dollars and
                        could provide money for the <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss> Special
                        Fund. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had probably
                        already discussed these matters in full with the Prime Minister<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d106fn4">See <ref target="#d105fn1">footnote 1, Document
                                105</ref>.</note> but this point is very important. Congress has
                        just turned down the tax bill he had requested and the United States faces a
                        deficit of $30 billion this year. The Australians have sent some 5,000–6,000
                        men to Vietnam and Thailand and the Philippines have each provided some men,
                        but the United States is paying the extra cost of these contributions for
                        them. He said that he understood the difficulties Japan faces but the best
                        investment for both Japan and the United States is to strongly support the
                            <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss> and to provide greater economic help
                        for South Vietnam. Japan is strong and growing stronger, but if we do not
                        save Vietnam and Thailand, we will all face a grave crisis which will cost
                        us dearly.</p>
                    <p>The President said that these are the things Japan should do. First, she
                        should increase her contribution to the <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>
                        Special Fund. If Japan can do this, he would try to get a bill through
                        Congress for the same purpose. Second, she should increase her assistance to
                        Vietnam. She should look everywhere and scrape up as much as she can,
                        especially since she cannot send men. Now, the United States should provide
                        an additional 50,000 men for General <persName corresp="#p_WWC1"
                            >Westmoreland</persName>, in addition to paying the extra costs to the
                            <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and Thailand for their
                        contributions. If Japan cannot send men, she should help as much as possible
                        in whatever way she can before it is too late. We think that the best
                        investment for the economy, the people and the region is the <gloss
                            target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss> Special Fund. If the United States can
                        contribute $200 million, Japan should match this figure, as well as doing
                        something extra for Vietnam. If Japan and the United States can work
                        together, we can also do more to save Indonesia. These actions are all
                        desirable and the President said he hoped Japan would do what he had
                        outlined. However, he did not wish to do all the talking, he hoped to hear
                        what the Prime Minister had to say.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that he was basically in full agreement with the
                        President on the needs of these countries. He said he would make every
                        effort to try to provide whatever help is needed, in fact, <pb n="238"
                            xml:id="pg_238" facs="0274"/>this is so stated in the communiqué, even
                        though no specific amounts are cited.<note n="5" xml:id="d106fn5">The topic
                            is discussed in paragraph VI of the joint communiqué.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>He said, with reference to the Joint Communiqué, that prior to leaving Japan
                        for Washington he had been received by the Emperor, who emphasized the
                        paramount importance of Japan's security. At present Japan is secure under
                        the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which provides that the United States will
                        defend Japan against external attack. However, Communist China is developing
                        nuclear weapons and Japan may soon be threatened by a nuclear attack. More
                        than two years ago, the President assured the Prime Minister that the United
                        States would live up to her commitment to defend Japan “against any form of
                        attack.” He said he wished to ask the President to reconfirm this assurance
                        at this time because of the concern expressed by the Emperor and in view of
                        the discussions on the status of Okinawa.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the United States is committed and as long as he is
                        President we would carry out this commitment. However, he said that the
                        Prime Minister has probably seen the difficulties we face under the SEATO
                        Treaty.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister thanked him and said he was gratified by this reassurance.
                        He appreciated the deep concern of the United States not only in her own
                        security but also in that of other parts of the world. He said that as Prime
                        Minister he must always consider the security of his own country ahead of
                        any other problem, for which reason he fully appreciated and sympathized
                        with the President's concern for security, even though there is a difference
                        in the scale of the security problems faced by both countries. He said that
                        Japan fully understands the difficult position of the United States and the
                        problems she faces. Therefore, he said he would make every effort to do
                        whatever he could to ease the President's burden.</p>
                    <p>The President said that it would be very helpful if Japan would match the
                        American contribution to the <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss> Special
                        Fund, which the President has now requested of Congress for this area 10,000
                        miles away. If Japan were to provide only $100 million for the Special Fund,
                        the Congress would surely cite the great deficit we face. For that reason we
                        wished to have Japanese help. We understand Japan's problem but still hope
                        that Japan could do more.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan's next fiscal year budget is now being
                        drafted. It provides for $20 million of the $100 million previously promised
                        by Japan for the Special Fund and the Government will consider fully the
                        possibility of increasing Japan's agreed contribution. Even though he could
                        not promise to increase the contribution to $200 <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239"
                            facs="0275"/>million, the Prime Minister assured the President that he
                        would do his best to help. He said that he had already told Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> of this intention.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the bill authorizing this contribution to the <gloss
                            target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss> Special Fund is now in the Senate Foreign
                        Relations Committee but if critics like Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2"
                            >Fulbright</persName> do not support it, he would be unable to do
                        anything. He did not wish to exert unseemly pressure on the Prime Minister
                        but the prospects for a favorable Committee report of the request for this
                        $200 million would be improved considerably if someone could testify in the
                        hearings in January that Japan plans to provide $200 million.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that he will do everything he can to help but in all
                        frankness he said that the next fiscal year budget now being drafted calls
                        for an across-the-board personnel reduction of 5% in the civil service.
                        Every ministry is being asked to eliminate the equivalent of one bureau.
                        Therefore, he said that he could not make any promises with 100% assurance
                        and did not wish to create any false impressions about what he could do.
                        (When his interpreter, Mr. <persName>Shimanouchi</persName>, suggested that
                        the Prime Minister promise more strongly to do something to reassure the
                        President, the Prime Minister told Mr. <persName>Shimanouchi</persName> that
                        he could not do so in all sincerity because he wished, above all, to be
                        honest with the President.)</p>
                    <p>The President said that contributions to the Special Fund would be spread out
                        over a five-year period and the entire sum need not be appropriated in one
                        year. The Prime Minister said that the $20 million appropriation this coming
                        fiscal year would be Japan's first installment toward the agreed amount of
                        $100 million.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether Japan could do anything further in Vietnam to
                        develop agriculture, fisheries, communications or transportation. He said
                        that it is essential that other nations begin to do more now that the latest
                        polls show only 24% support for him.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan presently is helping to establish the
                        agricultural school at Cantho in the Vietnam delta as well as the
                        agricultural guidance center to train agricultural specialists. He said that
                        the President is probably already familiar with the Japanese medical program
                        in Vietnam, including the hospital.</p>
                    <p>(At this point a secretary brought in copies of the Joint Communiqué, ready
                        for release.)</p>
                    <p>The President asked if the Prime Minister was satisfied with the Joint
                        Communiqué. The Prime Minister said that it was excellent and asked whether
                        the President would approve it. The President asked whether he would agree
                        to any specific programs to provide additional assistance in agriculture,
                        fisheries, transports and communications, as the communiqué states Japan
                        intends to do. It is not necessary to <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240"
                            facs="0276"/>refer to such specific programs publicly, but the President
                        said it would be helpful if he could cite such concrete programs to
                        influential Congressional and other leaders confidentially. When he received
                        the gift last night of a Sony TV video tape recorder the President thought
                        that it might be possible to work out a joint educational television project
                        for Vietnam to offset the shortage of teachers there. A few teachers
                        broadcasting from one central location could reach many primary schools, if
                        these were equipped with television receivers. Perhaps such a program could
                        be designed to fight illiteracy in Vietnam. Japan might be able to assume
                        additional responsibilities for education, and even agriculture, in this
                        way. If the United States supplied the personnel, the know-how and the
                        leadership, Japan need only provide the equipment, the television receivers,
                        to build an educational TV system which would benefit 17 million South
                        Vietnamese. What is needed particularly is a program to help the society
                        move forward, not under totalitarianism but under democracy and a spirit of
                        social conscience. Why not provide educational TV to do this? He had signed
                        a bill the other day to provide for educational TV in the United States,
                        which had met with a very favorable response. Therefore, he proposed that
                        American experts work with the Japanese to set up an educational TV system
                        in Vietnam. This country would supply the men and the know-how, and Japan
                        would supply the TV receivers. He asked whether the Prime Minister could
                        help in this way.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that this is an excellent idea, but Japan is
                        presently providing bilateral assistance to both the Philippines and
                        Thailand to improve their domestic communications systems and has learned
                        that such a program is not very useful beyond a certain point without an
                        adequate technological base. He asked whether Vietnam could effectively
                        profit from such an educational TV system.</p>
                    <p>The President said that this may be true but the United States has already
                        helped to install a general purpose television system in Vietnam. If this
                        can be used for entertainment it can also be used for education. The only
                        question is, who will supply the receivers? If we provide assistance in
                        know-how, teachers and curriculum, and if Japan can provide the television
                        receivers, all the Vietnamese would sooner or later wish to buy Japanese
                        television sets just as many Americans buy Sony sets now. (To illustrate his
                        point, he picked up a Sony transistor radio from his desk and played it for
                        the Prime Minister.)</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that was an excellent idea and he promised that Japan
                        would consider it.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the United States could furnish technical know-how
                        and would conduct a survey to determine the number of sites where TV
                        receivers would be needed. Japan cannot send men, so the United States will
                        do that but both countries could undertake this <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241"
                            facs="0277"/>as a joint venture. Such cooperation is essential because
                        the United States already is spending $30 billion a year in this area.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that this is indeed a good idea and agreed to
                        cooperate.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he would speak to Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> about it tomorrow and report that the
                        Prime Minister liked the idea. He would also consult with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> to clarify the needs so
                        that the United States and Japan could work out the details of this
                        cooperative project. It would be most helpful if the President could tell
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> that both countries
                        have agreed to this.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that the President should tell him that Japan does
                        agree to cooperate in this project.</p>
                    <p>The President said this would be helpful, for now he could privately inform
                        members of Congress of Japan's additional efforts in education as well as
                        the hospital in Vietnam, about her efforts for the <gloss target="#t_ADB1"
                            >ADB</gloss>, and about assuming 1/3 of the obligation for economic
                        assistance to Indonesia. This would be most helpful in meeting possible
                        criticism of the next paragraph of the Joint Communiqué, Paragraph VII. (The
                        President read Paragraph VII aloud in English, with special emphasis on the
                        reversion of the Bonins and the steps to be taken on the Ryukyus.)<note
                            n="6" xml:id="d106fn6">Paragraph VII provided that a target date for
                            reversion of the Ryukyus would be settled “within a few years,” whereas
                            consultations would begin immediately to arrange for the timely return
                            of the Bonins.</note> He said that the Prime Minister would probably not
                        be greeted by such demonstrations on his return as had marked his departure
                        for the United States, because he would bring home this very good
                        communiqué.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that he always exerted his best efforts to carry out
                        his responsibilities regardless of demonstrations, because some people would
                        demonstrate no matter what he did. The President said this was admirable.
                        The Prime Minister should be congratulated for the great victory represented
                        by this Joint Communiqué, and for making in it the forward-looking statement
                        that Japan and the United States will work more closely together. The Prime
                        Minister said that he did not think of these great issues in terms of a
                        victory in the communiqué, but rather in terms of further increasing
                        mutually satisfactory cooperation between Japan and the United States. The
                        President said that this communiqué was indeed a step forward, and should
                        help the Prime Minister to deal with public opinion at home. The Bonin
                        Islands involved strong American sentiments and a deep emotional issue, and
                        it is only Japan's willingness to assume additional responsibilities that
                        would enable him to defend the decision to return these <pb n="242"
                            xml:id="pg_242" facs="0278"/>islands. Japan's help is essential in view
                        of the possibility of a deficit of $30 billion this year.</p>
                    <p>He hoped that Japan would take $500 million in securities to ease the
                        temporary balance of payments difficulties the United States faces. The
                        Prime Minister said his Government would study this very seriously. The
                        President said “don't study it, do it.” The Prime Minister said that both
                        Germany and Japan have each been asked to purchase $500 million in
                        securities, even though Germany has reserves of $7 billion and Japan only $2
                        billion. The President urged him again to consider the purchase of $500
                        million because it is absolutely essential. The Prime Minister said that he
                        would discuss this with the Ministry of Finance immediately after his
                        return. Japan has already decided to buy $300 million worth of securities,
                        but he could make no promise to buy an additional $200 million.</p>
                    <p>The President said that there are many demands placed on the Government. For
                        example, there are riots in the cities and many people insist on Government
                        help to rebuild them. The United States maintains six divisions in Germany,
                        two divisions in Korea and a total of 600,000 troops in Vietnam, including
                        foreign detachments for which we are paying. Without these defense
                        expenditures the United States would have no balance of payments problems.
                        Strong men are needed to step up and take these securities now in the same
                        way the United States has agreed to support the British pound in spite of
                        these difficulties.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan has reserves of $2 billion, but only $500
                        million is liquid. If the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> buys $500
                        million, she will lose her entire liquidity. For this reason, the Ministry
                        of Finance experts are deeply concerned about making a commitment to
                        purchase $500 million worth of securities. He said it would be simpler at
                        this point to agree to do so, but he would not wish to make a promise he was
                        not certain he could honor.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the Prime Minister should impress the Minister of
                        Finance that the United States faces a great deficit even though it must
                        continue to honor its commitments. What is needed temporarily is some money
                        to tide the United States over this period of crisis. He should be urged to
                        consider the alternatives.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan would give full consideration to this
                        request, but would be limited by the extent of its liquid reserve. If all
                        Japan's liquid reserves of $500 million were committed, this would leave
                        only non-liquid reserves of $1.7 billion. Japan would be totally without any
                        liquidity. He asked if there was any means for Japan to buy the securities,
                        but still “keep the money available within the country.”</p>
                    <p>The President said he was only urging the Prime Minister to do what was
                        humanly possible, but was not asking him to undertake any <pb n="243"
                            xml:id="pg_243" facs="0279"/>action which was dangerous. The Prime
                        Minister said that he was speaking in all sincerity and would not make an
                        empty promise. Study of this matter before he had departed Japan for
                        Washington had disclosed that $300 million was the best Japan could do at
                        this time. In fact, Japan was actively considering a plan to secure $25
                        million in West German marks to increase her own liquidity. (The President
                        telephoned Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> at this
                        point to ask whether there was any method by which Japan could meet the
                        United States request without losing her liquidity. He also asked for a

                    <p>The Prime Minister said he would do his best to meet the American request,
                        because he fully understood the President's concern.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the Secretary of the Treasury would look into the
                        question of protecting Japan's liquidity as a means of helping her purchase
                        the full amount of $500 million worth of medium-term securities. The United
                        States had already announced her intention of providing half of the $1
                        billion needed to help Britain in this present crisis. The Federal Reserve
                        Open Market Committee had approved this today, and both the Italian and
                        German Governments had agreed today to do their share. The United States
                        would not devalue her own currency, regardless of what Britain might do. If
                        Japan and the United States would stand firm, other countries would not be
                        so likely to devalue their currencies or to act irresponsibly in the present
                        financial crisis.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan had no thought whatsoever of devaluing the
                        yen at this time, but if her foreign reserves declined in value as a
                        consequence of devaluation by other nations the Government would have to
                        consider what it should do in its own interest. The President said that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> had just told him
                        that there were a number of methods by which Japan might buy $500 million
                        without endangering her liquidity. These will be discussed with the Japanese
                        experts as soon as possible. It is essential to help the United States in
                        this matter because this country is so helpful to Japan in others. The Prime
                        Minister agreed that this is evidenced by the Joint Communiqué.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he wished to adjourn to the Cabinet room to tell the
                        American and Japanese officials waiting there that: <list>

                                contribution, the President was concerned that he might get nothing

                                Minister during his East Asian visits were very helpful in this
                                respect. In the final analysis, the United States can only
                                “supplement” Asians in defense of their freedom but cannot
                                “supplant” them.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister's address to the Press Club today had also been extremely
                        helpful. The President also said that he wished to continue to work firmly
                        toward the development of a free and democratic “new Asia,” through such
                        institutions as the <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>, even though there
                        may be those in Congress who are critical. Such positive statements by the
                        Prime Minister are even more essential now in view of the agreement
                        contained in Paragraph VII of the Joint Communiqué.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that he pledged himself to make concrete efforts to
                        help ease the President's burdens and he wished to offer the President his
                        full “moral support.”</p>
                    <p>The President said that the situation is difficult. There are demonstrations
                        in Tokyo but on the other hand, the Senate is critical here of his efforts
                        and his support is down to 24% in the polls. If the Prime Minister could
                        take his place, he would fully understand why it is essential that Japan do
                        more in this area. No doubt there would be protests against the agreement in
                        Paragraph VII of the Joint Communiqué, but the President said that he would
                        stand firmly behind this commitment.</p>
                    <p>He said that the Prime Minister would have been greatly encouraged if he had
                        heard Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> say in today's
                        Cabinet meeting that there is no leader in the world today more faithful and
                        more courageous than the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that all responsible leaders who do their duty must
                        be prepared for such attacks and criticisms but he was convinced that he
                        must do his best despite such attacks. The President said that he liked the
                        Prime Minister's courage.</p>

                                    of Japan that, in the event of a contingency requiring use of
                                    these islands for nuclear weapons storage, the United States
                                    would wish to raise this matter, and would hope that such a
                                    request would be regarded in a different light than it would in
                                    relation to the Japanese home islands. The United States would
                                    anticipate a favorable reaction since such a request would not
                                    be made unless it was essential for the security of the area. We
                                    believe such a statement should be made an official part of the
                                    record of negotiations in some form but do not intend to seek a

                            thought our concern could be accommodated at this time by my giving him
                            top secret note advising him that in event contingency requiring nuclear
                            storage we would wish raise matter and would hope request would be
                            regarded in different light than for in Japan proper and would
                            anticipate favorable reaction since request would not be made unless
                            essential for vital security interests of area including those of Japan
                            (ref B). (I mentioned <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> contingency as
                            example of type of problem we had in mind.) I added that we would not

                            <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> said that under a contingency
                            in which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would contemplate
                            possibility of use of nuclear weapons in this area Japanese interests
                            would also be so deeply involved that any request by us for nuclear
                            storage would be considered in a vastly different atmosphere than that
                            now prevailing. At such a crisis question of nuclear storage would have
                            to be considered with respect to all of Japanese territory and not just
                            a particular part such as Bonins. It would be very difficult to draw a
                            distinction of principle between various parts of the country. In recent
                            vigorous Diet debate he and <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss>
                            had said nuclear issue not now involved in return of Bonins but had been
                            careful to keep their freedom of action with respect to Okinawa.
                            “Greatest domestic political problem <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            faces over next few years is that of Okinawa nuclear issue.” He would
                            greatly regret anything that could possibly leak out and muddy waters on
                            fundamental Okinawa issue which <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> had
                            to face. Thus though even no reply was necessary or expected he much
                            hoped we would not feel it necessary to transmit such a note.</item>

                    <p>“December 31, 1967</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>At the close of 1967 we take satisfaction in the many constructive
                        accomplishments we have achieved together. I greatly value our talks in
                        November and the steps we then took to strengthen our partnership to work
                        together for an enduring peace and human betterment in Asia. I think we can
                        take pride in the arrangements for the return to Japan of the Bonin Islands,
                        and in the fundamental understanding on the future of the Ryukyu Islands. We
                        can also be proud of our achievements in the Kennedy Round, and in the
                        emergence of the Asian Development Bank as an active institution with the
                        prospect of additional special funds.</p>
                    <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0288"/>
                    <p>The speculative fever of these weeks has severely tested our methods of
                        cooperating on economic problems; but, we have continued to work together
                        effectively in a financial world suddenly beset by fear and disorder. We
                        have, thus far, met and repelled a serious threat to the foundations of the
                        international monetary systems, which, in turn, could also undo the
                        accomplishments of the Kennedy Round and the unity of the system of
                        international commerce.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the agreements at London and Rio on a plan to supplement existing
                        reserve assets are a further reason for solid satisfaction, as we look to
                        the longer future.</p>
                    <p>In these achievements Minister Mizuta and Governor <persName corresp="#p_UM1"
                            >Usami</persName> of the Bank of Japan have played important and,
                        indeed, vital roles. I know that they have contributed much to the recent
                        efforts to preserve order in the gold and foreign exchange markets. I am
                        reassured by our mutual determination to exert a constructive force in the
                        world financial system. This, I know, reflects a clear common understanding
                        of the importance of international monetary cooperation in creating that
                        environment of safety and opportunity which is required for the continued
                        growth and stability of our nations' economies.</p>
                    <p>During our talks in Washington in November, I shared with you our concerns
                        with the balance of payments position of the United States. Your most
                        helpful and constructive response of offering to undertake actions resulting
                        in a $300 million improvement in these accounts and to consider seriously
                        further steps was most gratifying to me personally. It was particularly
                        appreciated in view of the deficit Japan is facing in its own balance of
                        payment position during 1967 and of the burden Japan is sharing for
                        assisting the developing countries of Asia particularly.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, despite these and other helpful actions by our partners, our
                        concern about the balance of payments position of the United States has been
                        increased by events of recent weeks. As a result, I am announcing, on
                        January 1, 1968, a new and vastly strengthened program to reduce our deficit
                        and strengthen the international monetary system.</p>
                    <p>In the program, I will press for the tax increase to restrain excessive
                        demand in the United States and to reduce our budget deficit to manageable
                        proportions. I hope that this bill will soon become law. This, in itself,
                        should be a helpful factor in our balance of payments and should demonstrate
                        to the world that we will keep our own economic house in order. And the
                        Federal Reserve has already made clear its determination to use monetary
                        policy to this end.</p>
                    <p>But much more needs to be done; and we propose to do much more. Our balance
                        of payments actions are designed to improve both our current and our capital
                        accounts.</p>
                    <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0289"/>
                    <p>These actions will be painful to the United States and, to some degree, to
                        our international partners. They are designed to avoid as far as possible
                        adverse effects on the developing areas of the world. We hope they will
                        result more in the reduction of surpluses than in the shift or increase of
                        deficits. And we have kept very much in mind the views of other countries
                        and the international economic institutions.</p>
                    <p>In this effort we wish to proceed within the spirit and the letter of the
                        recent Resolution of <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> the Ministerial
                        Council that the adjustment of the American deficit and the European surplus
                        is a matter of common concern, to be handled cooperatively. Surpluses in
                        international payments are the mirror image of deficits. Thus, both surplus
                        and deficit countries must strive to reach balance and act cooperatively to
                        this end. This is no less true in the 1960's than it was in the late 1940's
                        and 50's. when we carried the responsibilities of a surplus nation. This
                        concept was definitively developed by our best economic and financial
                        experts in a carefully prepared <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Report
                        on “The Adjustment Process” in August 1966.<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">Not
                            found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our deficits have been the net result of a current account surplus, including
                        a trade surplus, inadequate to support foreign exchange costs of our
                        external capital flows, foreign aid programs, and military expenditures for
                        the common defense. During the period of the “dollar gap,” these deficits
                        helped redistribute the world's monetary reserves—the time has come, we all
                        agree, to bring them to an end.</p>
                    <p>As we see the problem, we need to act to improve our current account, reduce
                        capital outflows, and neutralize more fully our net foreign exchange
                        expenditures in the common defense. Our new program is designed to move us
                        strongly towards equilibrium. But full success will require the
                        understanding and cooperation of our partners. It seems axiomatic to us, and
                        basic to our view of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Resolution,
                        that those in strong reserve positions, or in surplus, should avoid actions
                        that increase surpluses, should not take offsetting action to preserve their
                        surpluses—indeed, that it will be necessary for them to take positive action
                        to move toward balance. Otherwise, the only result will be to shift the
                        adjustment burden to those who can least bear it or to make it more
                        difficult for us to achieve balance. In our judgment—and, I believe, in your
                        judgment—it is important for the United States to move decisively toward
                        balance with the least possible dislocation to the world's system of trade
                        and finance. Our mutual security and collective well-being, which rest upon
                        the continuing strength and unity of the international economic system, are
                        at stake. It is in this sense <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0290"/>that
                        I hope that you and your Government will appraise our new and strengthened
                        program. I have asked Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> to call on you
                        to explain our new program more fully. I have also asked Undersecretary
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> to visit with you in Tokyo next week to
                        review further both this program and the entire scope of our mutual
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Our two governments are also planning to hold a meeting of the Subcommittee
                        of the Joint Cabinet Committee in late January to consider our respective
                        balance of payments problems. This meeting will afford an opportunity to
                        discuss with you in detail our new program as well as the bilateral actions
                        we have already agreed to during our meeting in November in the light of
                        balance of payments problems faced by both our countries.</p>
                    <p>I trust you and your key ministers will support this program as you in the
                        past have supported other measures to defend the dollar, thereby helping to
                        preserve confidence in the system we have built so diligently together and
                        in which we have such a great mutual stake.</p>

                        <item>Japan is acquiring an increasingly important position in the
                            international economic community; its remarkable economic growth will
                            soon make it the third most productive nation after the US and the USSR.
                            At the same time, Japan is becoming progressively more assertive in
                            world and regional affairs. The constraints on Japan's willingness to
                            seek international political responsibilities are bound to diminish
                            further over time, nevertheless its acceptance of such responsibilities,
                            and its exercise of influence and power in international affairs
                            generally, will probably not increase to the degree suggested by its
                            powerful economic position within the next 5 to 10 years.<note n="2"

                        <item>We believe that Japan will continue to identify its basic interests
                            with those of the US and the Free World over the next 5 to 10 years. In
                            particular, it will probably devote important diplomatic efforts to
                            cementing friendly relationships with its leading trading partners—the
                            US, Canada, and Australia. These economic ties and an increasing
                            similarity of political goals have aroused Japanese interest in the

                            security. In relations with the US, Okinawa is likely to continue as a
                            troublesome problem, but we foresee no effective opposition in Japan to
                            the continued application of the US-Japan Security Treaty past 1970.
                            During the next five years, Japan will probably not decide to develop
                            nuclear weapons but it will keep the option open. It will also improve
                            its conventional military capabilities, particularly its air and sea

                            East Asia, but the Japanese will continue to avoid unnecessary
                            provocation of Peking while working, mainly through economic means, to
                            limit its influence. In the Japanese view, security in Asia can best be
                            insured by the development in Peking of a less militant and more
                            realistic view of the outside world; Japan will attempt to foster any
                            such tendencies in China, taking care not to impair its own relationship

                        <item>Japan will seek to expand its influence in South Korea and Taiwan, and
                            in Southeast Asia, but its interests in the latter region are less
                            compelling. Japan is reluctant to become deeply involved in the region's
                            political turbulence, considers that security there is primarily the
                            responsibility of the US, and is aware that Southeast Asia trade is not
                            critically important to Japan's economy. Japan's most likely course for
                            the next few years will be to continue its present emphasis on economic
                            assistance; its role in the political field will probably grow but it
                            will still move carefully, applying its influence in support of
                            stability and regional cooperation.</item>

                    <p>The Japanese are being forced to come to grips with the problem of nuclear
                        defense. For many years they have lived and prospered under the United
                        States umbrella, without nuclear weapons on their soil and without having to
                        discard their so-called “nuclear allergy.” Now, however, with 1) a decision
                        to be made as to US base rights on Okinawa, 2) <gloss target="#t_ABM1"
                            >ABM</gloss>'s, <gloss target="#t_NPSS1">NPSS</gloss>'s and the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> being widely discussed, 3) the Chinese
                        Communist nuclear missile threat fast becoming a reality, and 4) the broad
                        question of Japan's future world role opening up, the Japanese are being
                        pushed into making adjustments in their approach to the problem. The United
                        States will have an important direct and indirect influence on Japanese
                        defense decisions in the nuclear field.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Aversion to Nuclear Weapons Remains</hi>. Though the
                        Japanese press has come increasingly to write openly and knowledgeably about
                        nuclear weapons, the majority of the Japanese public still opposes Japanese
                        acquisition of nuclear arms. (In a December 1967 poll 60% opposed and 14%
                        favored Japan's having nuclear arms.) No responsible Japanese leader is
                        prepared openly to advocate a change in government policy on this issue;
                        there are reports that a few top conservatives believe Japan may have to or
                        even should eventually acquire them, but there is no desire for these arms
                        now. (Conservative leaders would like to reduce the “nuclear allergy,”
                        however, in case it becomes necessary for Japan to permit the introduction
                        of or to acquire nuclear weapons.) Illustrative of the prevailing attitudes,
                        during the debate on Okinawa and defense at the December extraordinary Diet
                        session following Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                        >Sato</persName>'s visit to the United States, the opposition parties played
                        on the aversion to nuclear arms by alleging that the government was seeking
                        an opening wedge to bring these weapons into Japan. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> felt impelled to reaffirm repeatedly as
                        government policy the so-called “three nuclear principles”—no Japanese
                        manufacture, no Japanese possession, and no introduction into Japan of
                        nuclear weapons. He said Japan would rely on the US nuclear deterrent <pb
                            n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0295"/>and deferred any decision on the
                        status of US bases in Okinawa to the future.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Okinawa Reversion May Force Decision on Introduction of US
                            Weapons</hi>. Nevertheless, pressures for reversion of Okinawa are
                        forcing the government toward a decision on whether to permit US nuclear
                        weapons on Japanese soil. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> has
                        committed himself to achieving within two or three years a timetable for the
                        reversion of Okinawa. Although he has said that the question of US base
                        rights can be resolved afterwards, it seems clear that the Japanese will
                        have to settle this issue before they can formulate a meaningful position on
                        a timetable, unless, of course, the United States decides nuclear weapons on
                        Okinawa are no longer necessary or desirable. In practical terms, it would
                        probably be impossible for the Japanese Government to finesse the issue by
                        legalistic stratagems, such as not assuming administrative jurisdiction over
                        the territory occupied by US installations; the opposition would have good
                        grounds for charging duplicity and evasion. From the way the debate has
                        gone, there is good reason to believe that <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> is using the problem to generate changes in public
                        attitudes toward Japanese security needs and reduce the Japanese “nuclear
                        allergy,” as the opposition has charged. This does not necessarily mean he
                        would actually like to grant nuclear base rights to the United States,
                        unless he had to in order to get Okinawa back.</p>

                        soul-searching in Japan, as it has focused attention on Japan's future role
                        in a world of nuclear-weapons and non-nuclear-weapons states. The Japanese
                        know that they can acquire a nuclear-weapon capability as rapidly as any
                        other non-weapons state, but thus far they have chosen to deny themselves
                        this world status symbol, partly because of the “nuclear allergy,” partly on
                        practical and partly on moral grounds, all of which are interrelated. The
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, however, <pb n="261"
                            xml:id="pg_261" facs="0297"/>raises the possibility of permanent self
                        denial together with a permanent second-class power status. It appears that
                        the Japanese will rationalize themselves around this problem, by signing the
                        treaty but still maintaining their long range options. They have already
                        insisted that the treaty contain provisions for periodic review, that all
                        states have equal rights in developing peaceful uses, and that the
                        nuclear-weapons powers promise to work toward discarding their arms while
                        still providing security for non-weapons states (despite the apparent
                        contradiction between the latter two propositions). They are also continuing
                        to push peaceful nuclear and space development. If it should become clear at
                        some future date that Japan would have to go nuclear to maintain its
                        position in the world, its capabilities for doing so would be fully
                        developed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">China—Menace and Competitor</hi>. Japan's overriding
                        concern is its relationship to its giant Asian neighbor, Communist China.
                        The Japanese know that their future role in Asia is directly tied in with
                        this relationship. While China remains militant and threatening, the
                        Japanese must either rely on the United States for protection, develop their
                        own defenses, or both. And even if Peking takes on a less menacing aspect,
                        it will remain a rival with Japan for Asian influence and leadership. The
                        fact that China is developing nuclear weapons and Japan is not is thus a
                        basic element in Japanese soul-searching over the nuclear weapons question,
                        and as China becomes more powerful, the pressures on Japan to compete or
                        accommodate are bound to increase. Most signs indicate Japan intends to
                        compete; at this stage, it hopes that US protection will be sufficient to
                        permit it to do so without nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">US Policy a Key Factor</hi>. As in the past the United
                        States will play a major role in influencing Japanese defense policy. The US
                        has urged the Japanese government to encourage Japanese
                        defense-consciousness and to improve Japanese conventional forces, thus
                        strengthening the government's own belief that this is in Japan's best
                        interests. US nuclear ship visits and the US stand on base rights in Okinawa
                        have contributed to the leadership's campaign to reduce Japan's nuclear
                        allergy. At this stage, however, Japan appears content to rely on the US
                        nuclear deterrent, possibly supplemented by <gloss target="#t_ABM1"
                            >ABM</gloss> protection.</p>
                    <p>Interest in nuclear questions seems likely to remain strong in Japan. Whether
                        in the future the Japanese will eventually decide to permit introduction of
                        nuclear weapons into Japan and/or to acquire them will depend to a large
                        extent on what the United States does—whether the US discourages Japan from
                        going nuclear and offers continued, credible protection or whether it
                        encourages Japan to acquire weapons either by lessening the credibility of
                        US protection or by urging the Japanese to produce or share weapons. The
                        possibility of Japan moving in <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0298"/>a
                        “de Gaullist” direction seems less likely, given its exposed strategic
                        position and its heavy dependence on US trade. Whatever happens, as the
                        Japanese “nuclear allergy” weakens, either through US actions, Japanese
                        actions, or simply with the passage of time, it seems certain that Japanese
                        willingness to entertain the possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons,
                        either in concert with the US or independently, will increase.</p>

                    <p>Surely the time has come for us to begin to resist attempts by the Japanese
                        to erode our base in Okinawa on the grounds of Japanese
                            “sensibilities.”<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">Okinawan opposition to

                            against North Vietnam increased in February, with some opponents calling
                            for removal of the planes from the island. The Ryukyuan Legislature
                            passed resolutions formalizing local opposition to the presence of the
                            B–52s, prompting Japan to express concern about the situation and offer

                        some six hundred thousand men in uniform in the Far Pacific engaged in
                        security tasks which are of vital concern to the future security of Japan.
                        We have taken over a quarter of a million casualties since 1945—most of them
                        in the Far East with Japan as a major beneficiary. So far as I know Japan
                        has not lost a single man in confronting those who are the major threat to
                        Japan itself. We are in a deadly struggle in Viet-Nam; my own view is that
                        if the Okinawa base is needed in the course of that struggle we should use
                        it and that Japan should be glad to see us use it.</p>

                        reaction. It is almost more than the flesh and spirit can bear to have Japan
                        whining about Okinawa while we <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0300"/>are
                        losing several hundred killed each month in behalf of our common security in
                        the Pacific. I would appreciate your best judgment as to how we can turn
                        this thing around because I feel strongly that we must turn around this
                        intolerable Japanese attitude.</p>

                        Okinawa, unequivocally stating that the Japanese Government had no intention
                        of asking the United States to remove B–52s from bases there. The United
                        States, in turn, assured the Japanese that the B–52s were stationed
                        temporarily on Kadena and would be redeployed at the conclusion of the
                        current crises. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                        also stressed that the bases on Okinawa functioned as a deterrent to
                        aggression and served the security needs of Japan. Both the Prime Minister
                        and the Foreign Minister addressed specific public fears in comments about
                        the B–52s by describing their presence as temporary, by noting that they
                        carried conventional rather than nuclear weapons, and by expressing
                        confidence that the sorties originating from Okinawa would not result in a
                        retaliatory attack on the Islands by a foreign power. (Telegrams 5953 and

                    <p>Although Japanese leaders adopted a firmer, and from the Embassy's point of
                        view a more positive, approach toward diffusing criticism of U.S. bases in
                        Okinawa, their response to the situation in Vietnam differed significantly.
                        Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> reported that both Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName>, as well as many other
                        Liberal Democratic Party members, out of concern for their domestic
                        political standing, adopted “a more and more bearish attitude on our
                        prospects in Vietnam.” Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> stated that
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> believed “he has
                        very much hitched his wagon to our star, especially on Vietnam; our current
                        difficulties there embarrass him, and failure on our part in Vietnam would
                        destroy him politically,” and pondered how to distance himself from the U.S.
                        effort in Vietnam. Aside from the purely political impact a United States
                        failure in Vietnam could have, the Embassy sensed that Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> feared that a defeat could
                        eventually have a negative impact on the entire security relationship
                        between Japan and the United States. The Administration conceded that little
                        could be done about the totality of the situation except to keep the
                        Japanese fully informed of developments in Vietnam and attempt to maintain
                        their confidence in a United States success there. (Telegram 5848 from

                    <p>The last major issue, that of Japan's response to events in Korea, remained
                        unsettled at this time. The Ambassador was instructed to consult with Prime

                        directly or through multilateral bodies, such as the Asian and Pacific
                        Council or the United Nations. In order to meet that goal, the Department of

                        that end, a Central Intelligence Agency expert on Korea was dispatched to

                        went to Kamakura Villa on Sunday, April 7, for a private meeting. A major
                        topic of the 5-hour discussion was Vietnam and the Prime Minister's
                        intention of sending a special envoy to Washington to discuss the situation

                    <p>The Japanese may be brewing up one of their periodic domestic convulsions
                        reminiscent of 1960, after the lengthiest post-war period of stability and
                        quiescence. The three major ingredients of the Kishi riots are again
                        surfacing—a wobbly and tarnished conservative government, an increasing
                        public tolerance of extra-legal opposition activity, and a potential
                        coalescing issue involving relations with the U.S.—the <pb n="272"
                            xml:id="pg_272" facs="0308"/>Okinawa problem. The trend is not yet
                        decisive but the next few months will be crucial.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>There is on the surface little reason for the current domestic stir-rings:
                        the economy is booming, perhaps even excessively; the <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> Government policies have been sound and
                        effective both domestically and abroad; and there are no dramatic and major
                        fractious problems between the U.S. and Japan, since even on Okinawa there
                        is so far broad common ground between the two governments on policies and
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>But, the mood in Japan belies these hard facts, and there is disarray where
                        there should be order. Politically, pressure for change is in the air.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> is under attack from within
                        and outside his party and increasingly incapable either of controlling his
                        vying bureaucracy or exercising effective leadership in the country. After
                        almost four years in power, <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> finds
                        his party rivals trying to push him out by discrediting the very policies
                        they essentially agree on. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s hold
                        over the Liberal Democratic Party may well depend upon the swing of a few
                        seats in the June Upper House elections—a most precarious and ridiculously
                        unfair political barometer.</p>
                    <p>The left has moved to the attack. Militant student groups, starting with the
                            <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi> visit, have pushed their extra-legal
                        tactics on many fronts with little censure. A particularly disturbing new
                        element is Komeito participation in the mass demonstrations—formerly the
                        monopoly of the left. The opposition has patched together a newly-found
                        unified front on some issues as Okinawa, where they can coalesce against the
                        status quo but not on what should be done. But, even the opposition has its
                        divisive forces with the Komeito moving leftward to seize upon declining
                        left-Socialist support.</p>
                    <p>For the root causes of this growing disarray, one must look primarily, but
                        not entirely, inside Japan. The margin of Japanese self-confidence has never
                        been large and today seems shrinking. <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> has been unable to provide the firm, but gentle,
                        guiding hand Japan seeks from its leaders. In pushing his electorate to face
                        up to the defense issue and the responsibilities of Asian leadership,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> has also disturbed the
                        mystical consensus and stirred the public to face issues it would prefer to
                        ignore. On the economic front, much headlined Japanese and U.S. balance of
                        payments and trade problems have caused the Japanese to cast a worried eye
                        at the state of their own economic health. And, the Japanese are aware that
                        Japan's posture in Asia has suffered from failures to deliver in timely
                        fashion reasonable assistance to Indonesia and Burma and more generally from
                        its awkward diplomacy in Southeast Asia. The consequence has been to
                        introduce an element of uncertainty into the domestic scene, and for the
                        Japanese, uncertainty is perhaps the most unpalatable of all conditions of
                        life.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Contributing to the current discontent has been the assumption of many that
                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> was acting not in Japan's own
                        interests but at U.S. behest. But, more important, a good number of Japanese
                        are having second thoughts about American staying power in Asia. U.S.
                        balance of payments difficulties, the Tet offensive, the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Pueblo</hi> incident, domestic disorders and the President's March 31
                        speech are all cited as evidences of American weakness. In separate private
                        conversations, the Governor of the Bank of Japan <persName corresp="#p_UM1"
                            >Usami</persName>, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MT3"
                            >Miki</persName> and a leading conservative friend of the U.S. each
                        revealed doubts about the constancy and successful prospects of our Vietnam
                        and Asian policies. As one Tokyo paper put it: “Some say U.S. foreign policy
                        can hardly be trusted because of its fickleness … Her foreign policy is
                        constantly swinging with the whims of public opinion.” Uncertainties in our
                        economic policies—particularly on the trade side—are another bone of
                        contention. Unexpected changes in U.S. policy without advance consultation
                        have also become a club in the hands of the opposition who deride <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s ability to influence his major
                        ally.</p>
                    <p>These frustrations with the U.S. have inevitably turned more and more
                        Japanese to brooding about the need for an “independent” Japanese foreign
                        policy—e.g. escaping from what <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName>
                        has called “excessive dependence” on the U.S. This is not new. It is a theme
                        which has reoccurred periodically throughout the post-occupation era,
                        particularly at times of internal stress or when the turns in U.S. policy
                        catch the Japanese Government by surprise.</p>
                    <p>“Independence” when it comes down to hard cases, however, is usually
                        exercised in only very limited terms. The Japanese have so far fallen back
                        on such secondary measures as overreacting and magnifying minor
                        U.S.-Japanese differences, showing uncooperativeness on petty matters when
                        the stake seems very small, and on resurrecting the old warhorse—China
                        policy, despite the fact that its China policy reflects Japan's own national
                        concerns and not American dictation. The hard fact is that Japan cannot
                        escape from its economic and military dependence on the U.S. without a
                        fundamental and costly policy change. This change, the Government and the
                        vast majority of Japanese are unprepared to undertake. When the Japanese
                        take a second hard look, they find that no amount of optics or whistling in
                        the dark can override this dependence or the inherent inequality in the U.S.
                        and Japanese position. This circumstance, however, only deepens the Japanese
                        frustration.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The key to the present malaise in Japan lies principally in the political
                        fortunes of <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>. It is too early to
                        count him out and he proved in the January 1967 Diet elections that his
                        survival factor is greater than <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0310"/>his
                        foes reckon. He is still aided by the absence of a logical successor
                        although <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> may be gaining strength.
                        But, he may be on the skids this time and then the very absence of a logical
                        successor could prolong and deepen the political and psychological crisis in
                        Japan. The July Upper House election could well be the moment of decision,
                        but the political crisis could be prolonged until the Liberal Democratic
                        Party presidential elections scheduled for December.</p>
                    <p>Until the political succession is settled, we should expect little respite
                        from either the indecisiveness of present Japanese policy or the nitpicking
                        querulousness cropping up on more and more issues involving us. For the most
                        part, these actions are likely to be more annoying to us than harmful.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and the Foreign Ministry
                        bureaucrats can be depended upon to hold the line against irresponsible
                        behavior on Vietnam, Korea and other key issues, although positive
                        cooperative steps will be harder to come by. Even on Communist China, the
                        Japanese are locked into present policies and may well even agree to a
                        carefully screened China differential in COCOM.</p>

                    <p>In early May 1968 reports of alleged leakage of radioactive material from the
                        nuclear-powered submarine USS <hi rend="italic">Swordfish</hi> while in port
                        at Sasebo caused a public-affairs crisis. Radiation readings taken on May 6
                        in the waters around Sasebo produced abnormally high results, although tests
                        conducted the very next day showed normal radiation levels at the port.
                        Japanese press coverage suggested a cover-up of the May 6 occurrence by the
                        Japanese Science and Technology Agency (<gloss target="#t_STA1"
                        >STA</gloss>), which had responsibility for monitoring United States
                        nuclear-powered vessels while in Japanese ports. Although the <gloss
                            target="#t_STA1">STA</gloss> initially eliminated the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Swordfish</hi> as a source of the radiation, it began to suggest the
                        opposite, after being targeted by the media. Experts from the United States,
                        including from the Atomic Energy Commission, investigated the alleged leaks
                        and found that the radiation readings derived from deficiencies in Japanese
                        monitoring facilities. The investigation also revealed that the <hi
                            rend="italic">Swordfish</hi> had not discharged coolant during its stay,
                        thus adding nothing to the waters. Even though the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Swordfish</hi> was eliminated as source of radioactive contamination,
                        visits by nuclear-powered submarines were suspended until proper monitoring
                        safeguards could be installed. Extensive cable traffic generated by the
                        incident is in the National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,

                    <p>In September the issue returned to the forefront because of press reports
                        about suspected increased radioactivity at the Okinawan port of Naha, where
                        traces of cobalt 60 were found in mud samples. (Telegram 11920 from Tokyo,
                        September 11; ibid.) The issue intensified when ensuing reports told of
                        three Ryukyuan divers allegedly suffering from radiation exposure after
                        being in the waters at Naha. Once the divers were thoroughly examined and
                        pronounced healthy by American doctors, however, press and public interest
                        in the issue abated. (Telegram from McCain, <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"

                        when an Air Force plane based at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa crashed off the
                        runway at Itazuke Air Base in Japan. The accident <pb n="277"
                            xml:id="pg_277" facs="0313"/>occurred on June 2 during a night training
                        flight. The plane struck a building under construction at Kyushu University
                        and narrowly avoided hitting a nearby storage building containing cobalt 60.
                        The incident sparked student demonstrations and ignited smoldering
                        opposition to United States bases in or around densely populated areas.

                    <p>Summary: 1. Japan's views of the US and its role in world, which have in past
                        provided base-line around which ups and downs in state of our relations have
                        occurred, may have been unsettled by recent <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278"
                            facs="0314"/>developments. In economic field, Arab-Israeli war, balance
                        of payments difficulties, “protectionism” scare, etc. are casting doubt on
                        extent to which Japan can continue to count on us to carry its ball as well
                        as our own in world economy, let alone expect special favors. In security
                        field, though opinions have been divided on need for protection against
                        threat, and though our military presence in Japan has increasingly become
                        embarrassment rather than asset to Japanese politicians, Japan has at least
                        seen our military containment posture as immutable part of landscape and
                        have generally assumed it would be successful—at least over short run. Tet
                        offensive and what was interpreted as abrupt shift into de-escalation and
                        negotiations with Hanoi have thrown doubt on US firmness and invincibility.
                        Racial violence and social unrest in America have roused concern over basic
                        stability of American society, made American image a rather less positive
                        political symbol. All this has combined with continuing long-run rise in
                        nationalism and decline in conservative strength to make it possible that
                        current worsening of perspective is not just because we are in political
                        valley, but perhaps something more fundamental. I thus consider it quite
                        possible that Japan is moving toward a serious reappraisal of our
                        relationship, with much potential for harm to our interests as we have thus
                        far defined them.</p>
                    <p>Summary: 2. As it looks to me now, damage to our economic interests from any
                        reappraisal would be limited by realities of Japan's economic position in
                        world. Efforts to diversify markets and sources of supply, with lessening of
                        degree of dependence on US, are certainly in cards, but not necessarily all
                        to the bad. Despite all Japan might do to increase trade with Communist
                        bloc, there are limits to how far Japan could go without sweeping
                        restructuring of her economy or without clear risks to vital interests.
                        Reappraisal might have implications for future of Japanese economic aid
                        programs, as US leverage for exertion of influence wanes and, perhaps, as
                        aid to S.E.A. comes into competition with China trade for available credit.
                        I believe, however, that there are now authentic Japanese advocates of aid,
                        and a developing consciousness of basic Japanese interests involved. Japan
                        will probably be cautious about overextension of credit to China, and there
                        will be more nationalistic gratification to be had from aiding S.E.A. than
                        from trading with a Communist China, which would never be willing to play
                        second fiddle to Japan. Our security interests seem to me more vulnerable,
                        with further retrograde movement possible along lines of recent difficulties
                        over <gloss target="#t_NPW1">NPW</gloss> entry, decreasing certainty of
                        smooth sailing in 1970, declining probability of Okinawa reversion with more
                        favorable status for bases than in Japan proper, etc. Politically, while
                        Japan will still be motivated by self-interest to side with us on many
                        issues, it will probably become even harder to get Japan to take our side on
                        any controversial issues. In short, recent developments and trends could do
                        considerable damage to our interests. It is important <pb n="279"
                            xml:id="pg_279" facs="0315"/>to note that even with all the above kinds
                        of damage figured in (and not all of it may materialize), we would still be
                        left with much that is positive in our relationship; however, it is also
                        important to note that things conceivably could get even worse, if world
                        economy turns sour and if U.S. finds it necessary to administer still more
                        shocks (e.g., <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>, “protectionism,”
                        withdrawal from Expo 70). We are going to have to do some serious
                        stock-taking ourselves as we move into the future. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. Recent developments are affecting Japan's views of and attitudes toward
                        United States in ways harmful to our interests, as we have defined them. We
                        must, of course, keep in mind historical fact that state of US-Japan
                        relations has moved along rather cyclical course, with peaks and valleys
                        occurring in response rather to balance of domestic political forces (e.g.,
                        the shifts in power position that seem inexorable part of life-cycle of
                        Japanese Prime Ministers) than to external events (though these have also
                        had impact). If views from peaks are misleading, so are those from valleys,
                        such as that which we at present share with <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName>. Nevertheless, with all due allowance made, and subject
                        to later reexamination, we must consider possibility that current harmful
                        trends may be fundamental.</p>
                    <p>4. Major factor that has in past kept floor under periodic ups and downs in
                        US-Japan relations is fairly stable conception on part of Japanese
                        leadership and most influential Japanese of U.S. world position and
                        importance of that position to themselves. Trade relationship, access to
                        U.S. capital markets and technology, and other concrete economic benefits
                        have been and are vital to Japan, and over the years Japan also has become
                        habituated to receiving special favors in economic field. In efforts to
                        protect Japan's interests in world economy and avoid repetition of nightmare
                        of nineteen thirties, when Japan felt itself being squeezed out of world
                        economy, Japan has been able to count on substantial identity of interest
                        with us and on our therefore being willing to carry ball. Japanese
                        determination at all costs to avoid jeopardizing these interests has imposed
                        limits on fluctuations in state of US-Japan relations.</p>
                    <p>5. Attitudes regarding U.S. regional security position have been mixed.
                        Substantial element of conservative leadership shares goals of containment
                        policy, as it has understood these goals, and regards them as in Japan's own
                        national interest. Others, not really believing there is security threat to
                        Japan serious enough to worry about, have gone along in security alliance
                        with us mainly out of desire to preserve other benefits of relationship with
                        U.S., e.g., economic benefits. Regardless of varying attitudes re necessity
                        or desirability of security relationship, most Japanese have shared
                        assumption that military containment policy was firmly fixed and likely to
                        be successful at least over short run. However, the security relationship
                        with the U.S. is primarily valued for the “nuclear umbrella” it gives Japan
                        and the role of U.S. forces in <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0316"/>the
                        security of South Korea and Taiwan. While the sophisticated recognize that
                        U.S. bases in Japan are important to this system, more generally these bases
                        are regarded as a nuisance which must be tolerated and a price to be paid
                        for other aspects of our relationship. Importantly the bases as such do not
                        constitute any political asset on which <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                        leadership can capitalize but with the <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi> and
                        OJI hospital riots, the Sasebo incident, the F–4 crash in Fukuoka, etc.
                        constitute situation in which the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> finds
                        itself constantly on the defensive against opposition attacks and the
                        political realities push the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> toward
                        taking position akin to those of the opposition.</p>
                    <p>6. In political field, despite determined efforts of antique-Marxist
                        opposition to build image of US as hateful capitalist-imperialist monster,
                        popular respect for US political institutions, infatuation with many aspects
                        of American mass culture, genuine respect for our intellectual attainments,
                        and visible attractions of the American way of life, have kept America a
                        strongly positive symbol. Renovationist parties, most intellectuals, and
                        many labor leaders are hostile to main lines of U.S. foreign policy, but
                        association with United States, manifestations of United States regard for
                        Japan and its leaders, have been valued assets usable by Japanese
                        conservative politicians, counterbalanced only in part by requirement that
                        politicans periodically demonstrate the right degree of “independence,” and
                        avoid image of slavishness or servility.</p>
                    <p>7. Recent major developments have called into question basic assumptions
                        about US. Arab-Israeli war brought home in forceful terms to <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> leaders that Japanese economy and security
                        dispositions must be based on assessment of international
                        political/strategic situation in which others than U.S. may play key role
                        and in which U.S. desires and action may not be decisive. Full context of
                        our B/P and dollar defense crisis, and our current and capital account
                        measures, both proposed and instituted, is emerging in manner to cast doubt
                        on extent to which Japan can rely on us to carry their ball as well as ours
                        in world economy, let alone continue to count on U.S. for special favors in
                        economic field. Tet offensive and what was interpreted as abrupt shift into
                        de-escalation and negotiations with Hanoi, together with apparent resistance
                        among American people to continuation of past military containment policies,
                        have thrown doubt on U.S. firmness and invincibility (though negotiations
                        were widely welcomed). Racial violence and other signs of social unrest in
                        America are in some conflict with past conceptions of American way of life,
                        and to some give rise to concern over basic stability of American
                        society.</p>
                    <p>8. There are two other developments which though not creating the
                        deterioration in Japan-US relations have measurably strengthened and
                        accelerated it. One is rising sense of self-confidence, encouraged by twenty
                        years of peace, economic growth, relative political stability, and
                        improvement in social and cultural life, which makes most Japanese <pb
                            n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0317"/>increasingly restless with
                        realities or implications of reliance on others, particularly United States.
                        Second development is continuing erosion of political strength of Liberal
                        Democratic Party, so that its supporters at polls now (Jan 1967) barely
                        exceed the combined totals of the supporters of the renovationists (counting
                        Komeito as renovationist, in keeping with its present posture). Opposition
                        parties, moreover, on foreign policy issues that matter, have tended during
                        this past year to find more and more common ground in neutrality, opposition
                        to the security pact, and an opening to China. We have already seen some
                        signs that conservative leadership in order to maintain power will find it
                        increasingly necessary to try to capture this rising nationalist sentiment
                        and pull teeth of opposition by pulling back somewhat from close American
                        ties and edging toward more accommodating relationship with Asian Communist
                        powers. Excursions to left by conservatives are nothing new (witness
                        Hatoyama, <persName corresp="#p_KI4">Kono</persName>, Fujiyama, et al.), but
                        they acquire new significance in present context.</p>
                    <p>9. There is thus every reason to expect that Japan will over next year or so
                        not only be reappraising its policy of individual issues involved in
                        US-Japan relations, but also taking a fresh critical look at validity of
                        past practice under which US-Japan relationship was cornerstone and major
                        determinant of Japanese positions in every field of international activity.
                        Following is attempt to explore tentatively kinds of damage to our interests
                        that might result from such a reappraisal.</p>
                    <p>10. Relationship in economic field has been due to reappraisal for long time
                        past, if only because of changing ratio of size of two economies. Some
                        eminent Japanese have for some time been urging diversification of Japan's
                        trade relationships away from us, and there are increasing numbers of
                        vigorous advocates of expanding trade with Mainland China. However, Japan's
                        room for maneuver in rearranging trade and economic relations is limited,
                        and the feasible degree of diversification of markets, e.g. to Europe and
                        S.E.A., would not necessarily be harmful to our interests, though we might
                        lose some economic leverage. (Some diversification and less sense of
                        dependence on the U.S. would in fact be psychologically healthy.) Even the
                        most determined effort to reorient trade would still, after lapse of several
                        years, leave U.S. as Japan's most important trading partner by far, and
                        would be unlikely to place Japan in relation of general trade dependence on
                        Communist markets. For Japan to move into really close alignment with
                        Communist bloc, even if it wished, would require sweeping reorganization of
                        Japan's economy, or else equally sweeping change in structure and philosophy
                        of bloc, which as now constituted is most inhospitable to kind of economy
                        Japan has developed.</p>
                    <p>11. How probable it is that Japan's reappraisal of US relationship will
                        militate against prospects for a more effective and generous <pb n="282"
                            xml:id="pg_282" facs="0318"/>Japanese economic aid program depends on
                        extent to which Japan's recent progress toward liberalization of aid Asia is
                        attributable to US pressure and influence. Our influence has certainly been
                        considerable but there are authentic Japanese advocates and basic Japanese
                        interests involved in more liberal aid to S.E.A. efforts to diversify trade
                        could of course lead to overextension of credit to China at expense of
                        capacity to extend aid credits to S.E.A.; however, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss> itself will be wary of overextension of credit. While
                        emotional complex about China will strengthen pressures for more trade,
                        China trade offers less potential gratification for Japan's nationalistic
                        desire to assert leadership than does economic assistance to S.E.A. nations.
                        Chances of Communist China's ever acknowledging any degree of Japanese
                        leadership seem nil, and Japan will certainly not play second fiddle to
                        China.</p>
                    <p>12. Over shorter run, certain of our economic and financial interests may
                        also suffer. While Japan will still be impelled by convergence of interests
                        to side with us in matters relating to international monetary reforms, in
                        opposing “vertical” tariff preferences, etc., and might start basing more of
                        its reserve accumulation on net earnings from Europe rather than U.S., Japan
                        will probably become still more cautious about elimination of <gloss
                            target="#t_QR1">QR</gloss>'s, [quote restrictions] freeing foreign
                        exchange for tourist travel, or capital liberalization, at least until it
                        has become clear that America is able to solve its economic problems in
                        responsible manner with international cooperation.</p>
                    <p>13. Damage to our security interests vis-à-vis Japan is potentially larger
                        than that to our economic interests. Outlook for free access to Japanese
                        ports for US nuclear vessels is already gloomier, and even popular
                        acceptance by 1970 of security treaty and extant base structure looks less
                        certain than it did six months or a year ago. Possibility of <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> accepting reversion of Okinawa with
                        substantially greater freedom of use than enjoyed by bases in Japan proper
                        has receded considerably since last winter. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss> cooperation in applying strategic controls to trade with
                        Asian Communist countries will almost certainly become harder to secure.
                        While prospect remains that Japan will sign and ratify <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> if treaty picks up real momentum within
                        coming year, Japanese advocates of keeping nuclear options open have
                        doubtless been strengthened. There are only very few counterbalancing
                        advantages that might conceivably emerge from reappraisal. Japan's
                        willingness to undertake limited ventures in regional collective security,
                        such as selling military equipment to S.E.A. nations, Taiwan, or Korea,
                        might increase, though domestic political hurdles for <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would remain formidable. Japan consensus
                        might come to tolerate something more than very gradual acceleration of
                        buildup in Japan's own defense which has been case over last few years, but
                        any value to U.S. of such a trend would be offset by probability that it
                        would be accompanied by assertive nationalist overtones and aggressive
                        demands for phase <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0319"/>down of U.S.
                        bases. All this worsening of outlook is due in part to current perspective
                        from valley. Whatever relaxed attitude rest of nation may take about
                        security threat to Japan, <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and his
                        likely successors will continue to entertain some genuine concern on this
                        score, and security relation with U.S. will probably continue to look to
                        them like most efficient and economical way of coping with threat; there are
                        accordingly limits beyond which leadership over next five years or so will
                        not wish to let alliance deteriorate. At same time, reappraisal such as we
                        are hypothecating would almost certainly produce some retrograde movement
                        along lines indicated.</p>
                    <p>14. Potential for damage to our political interests is also substantial.
                        Japanese may well become more closely engaged in thinking about post-Vietnam
                        reconstruction and may even move closer to readiness to participate modestly
                        in international control set up, but <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is
                        going to be quite leery of associating itself publicly and actively with any
                        controversial U.S. positions re Vietnam. Concern for relations with GRC as
                        well as U.S. and genuine uncertainty at policy levels as to full import of
                        cultural revolution will continue to restrict room for maneuver in area of
                        China policy. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> determination to beat us
                        to the punch in any shift of posture now so much greater, however, that some
                        gesture toward Peking seems certain to materialize. Urge to differentiate
                        their China policy from ours will make common approach to Chirep more
                        awkward, and increase potential pressures in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> for “compromise” solutions.</p>
                    <p>15. Damage that would be done to our interests if all or most of pessimistic
                        possibilities noted above materialized is obviously considerable. Japan's
                        positive contribution to our security interests would have been cut back,
                        and our ability to get Japan's political support for any controversial
                        political position would have been reduced. It is important to note again
                        that this is the perspective from a political valley, and that even with all
                        this damage we would still be left with a US-Japan relationship capable of
                        making a substantial positive contribution to American interests. It is also
                        important to note, however, that things could conceivably turn out worse
                        than now seems probable. For example, if world economy deteriorated
                        seriously, if U.S. really pulled back from Asia, and if US administered
                        succession of shocks (“protectionism,” withholding support from <gloss
                            target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>, refusal participate in Expo 70, etc),
                        cumulative effect could conceivably be to set Japan again on introverted
                        irrational course it followed in nineteen thirties. Changes in world
                        economic and strategic interrelationships would keep Japan from exhibiting
                        its irrationality in same forms it took a generation ago, but results could
                        be very damaging. I trust that we will keep this more remote—but
                        larger—danger in mind as we plan how to manage our relations with Japan in
                        months and years ahead.</p>

                            [the President].” (Ibid., President's Daily Diary) <persName

                            the U.S.-Japan Policy Planning Talks held June 14–15. He returned to
                            Tokyo on June 17. (Memorandum for the President, June 12; ibid.,
                            National Security File, Country File, Japan, Vol. VII)</note> The call
                        lasted a half hour.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> said that he appreciated an
                        opportunity to meet with the President in order to express his concern at
                        the recent turn in U.S.-Japanese relations, and particularly with respect to
                        the possible long-term implications of these difficulties. He started to
                        outline the import of his telegram of June 5,<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">
                            <ref target="#d123">Document 123</ref>. The telegram was retyped before
                            being given to the President along with a briefing memorandum, June 12,
                            prepared by <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> in
                            advance of his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis

                            Security File, Japan, Vol. VII)</note> but the President (presumably
                        familiar with the telegram) soon interjected with the theme that if our
                        relationship was to survive in the long run, the Japanese would have to
                        overcome their one-sided view of that relationship.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d124fn4">In his memorandum <persName>Rostow</persName> suggested
                            that the President stress that “the Japanese simply cannot go on taking
                            their security as a free gift from the U.S.” and that <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName> leave no doubt in his
                            dealings with Tokyo “that there must be a fundamental change in Japanese
                            attitudes if our relation is to survive in the long run.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        The President said that we had had an arm around the Japanese and held an
                        umbrella over them for a long time. The American people would not understand
                        the difficulties which the Japanese are presenting to us through their
                        reactions to recent events while we were losing 400 to 500 American lives
                        each week in Vietnam in the interest of Asian security.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> said that the Japanese often seemed
                        to believe that we should expect gratitude from them whenever they did
                        things which were actually in their own interest to begin with. He was
                        working to try to correct this Japanese habit.</p>
                    <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0321"/>
                    <p>The President said there were a number of things the Japanese could do to
                        contribute to Asian security. One of these might be to take increased
                        interest in peace keeping activities, particularly post-Vietnam. Ambassador
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> expressed the belief that there would be no
                        particular problem in getting the Japanese to do this. They would also
                        participate in reconstruction efforts.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that the governmental leadership and many informed
                        Japanese, of course, had a good understanding of our contribution to
                        Japanese security and of the need for Japan in turn to bear its obligations
                        in the relationship. He said that the same considerations which gave us
                        concern at the present time in our relations with Japan, were also giving
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> domestic trouble.
                        The Ambassador observed that despite present worries, our relationship was
                        still on a fundamentally sound basis. There are practical realities
                        contributing to keep it that way, including the fact that Japan has become
                        our best overseas trading partner, second only to our continental partner of
                        Canada. The President observed that Japan was doing very well in exports to
                        the United States also.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> mentioned the importance of our
                        present careful review of the problem of Okinawa reversion. In this context
                        the President reiterated his conviction that Japan cannot go on accepting
                        security gratis from the United States without better recognizing its own
                        obligations implied by our presently close relationship.</p>
                    <p>After the interview Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> expressed to me
                        his appreciation for the President's remarks, saying “I can use that to good
                        advantage in Tokyo.”</p>

                        to be stationed at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa. It is noted that a rate of
                        1710 sorties could be sustained without basing on Okinawa. This is offered
                        as a possibility if the “Korean contingency” is resolved and if the

                    <p>I remain persuaded, as I have stated in previous memoranda to you,<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d125fn3">Among which was <persName corresp="#p_MGD1"

                        Okinawa has a potential political impact which could seriously affect our
                        administration of the Ryukyus and our relationship with Japan. I have
                        particularly in mind the effect which this situation might have on the
                        November 1968 elections for the legislature and the Chief Executive of the
                        Government of the Ryukyu Islands. If that election comes out unfavorably to
                        us we face the prospect of greatly increased pressure on our administration
                        and bases in Okinawa.</p>
                    <p>The administration elected in the Ryukyus this November will be in office
                        from 1969 through 1972. In those years we can expect that we will have to
                        reach some accommodation with the Government of Japan regarding the return
                        of Okinawa to Japanese administration and the future of our bases there.
                        Those negotiations promise to be most difficult. Our position, and the
                        position of the Government of Japan, will be made much more difficult if
                        there is conflict between our administration on Okinawa and the local
                        government there.</p>
                    <p>My Deputy for International Affairs recently returned from a trip to Japan
                        and Okinawa, where he discussed the election prospects at length with
                        knowledgeable political observers in both areas. To a man these observers,
                        who are favorably disposed to our policies and who desire to see the
                        election come out in a manner satisfactory to us, indicated that the
                        continued presence of the B–52s on Okinawa is a substantial liability to the
                        United States and to the conservative party which we hope will win the
                        election. At Tab A is a recent report from Okinawa, noting that the
                        incumbent Chief Executive continues to press this view.<note n="4"

                        State Department Country Director for Japan recently sent to Bill
                            <persName>Bundy</persName>, assessing the Japanese political situation
                        and our relations with Japan. As noted there (page 4) the issue of Okinawa
                        is perhaps the major outstanding problem in U.S./Japanese relations, and an
                        incident involving the B–52s might precipitate a crisis within the governing
                        party of Japan, which has thus far behaved most responsibly with respect to
                        this problem.</p>
                    <p>Insofar as my particular concerns are involved, in question now at most are
                        90 sorties or 15 missions a month, a 5% reduction. I believe that carefully
                        weighed against the potential cost to our position in Okinawa and our
                        relations with Japan such a reduction should be directed. I understand that
                        in fact it may well be that 1800 sorties a month could be sustained from
                        basing at U Tapao and Guam only, by launching more sorties per aircraft per
                        month from U Tapao than are projected in the Joint Staff discussion of
                        alternatives. If this is correct, and if you decide to approve the continued
                        rate of 1800 sorties, I can certainly see no justification for continued
                        basing at Kadena which would override the political price we are paying.</p>
                    <p>Assuming that a decision is made which permits withdrawal of the B–52s from
                        Kadena prior to the Okinawan election, the timing of that withdrawal should
                        be as soon as possible.<note n="7" xml:id="d125fn7">Although the High
                            Commissioner appeared to support restricting or removing the B–52s for

                            strongly opposed to any such move, believing that only “free and

                            general defense of the Pacific area and in pursuance of our strategy”
                            would allow U.S. forces to carry out its missions in the region.

                            ibid.)</note> But as the election comes closer, Ryukyuan pressures for
                        B–52 withdrawal will certainly be reasserted and will continue to rise. We
                        do not want to appear to be withdrawing under this kind of pressure any more
                        than can be helped. Hence the sooner the withdrawal, the better.<note n="9"

                        electronic equipment from Japan to Communist China adds up to a shocking
                        contribution on Japan's part to Peking's sophistication of weaponry and
                        other production of military import. It could be misleading to some
                        recipients, however, in that it does not overtly point out the fact that,
                        according to all indications, the situation has markedly improved since the
                        spring of 1967. At that time, you may recall, we sent a high-level briefing
                        team to Tokyo on this subject and another briefing was given the Japanese
                        here last November.</p>
                    <p>It would seem to be even more in Japan's interest than in ours to curb this
                        sort of traffic and we believe that our briefings have been effective. (The
                        contribution through this type of export is in good measure to development
                        of nuclear devices which could threaten Japan much more easily than the
                        United States.) The list in the attached document shows that the peak period
                        was 1964 through 1966. There may be some lag in our learning of more recent
                        exports of this nature, if they have occurred, but with heightened concern
                        on the part of Japanese leadership and in the absence of intelligence
                        indicating recent exports of this nature, we have reason to hope that they
                        are virtually nonexistent or at least very considerably reduced.</p>

                        <p>In November, the Ryukyuans will elect the Chief Executive of the

                            of Naha, the largest city. The fate of the friendly conservative forces
                            in these elections will directly and vitally affect the U.S.
                            administration of the Ryukyus. Opposition control of the Chief Executive
                            post alone, or in conjunction with control of the legislature, could so
                            adversely affect our administration as to threaten the use of our bases.
                            Moreover, the outcome of the election will have a direct bearing on the
                            future course of the reversion issue. This paper analyzes the U.S. stake
                            in the elections, the prospects of Ryukyuan conservatives, and
                            recommends policy action consistent with basic U.S. interests in the
                            Ryukyus and Japan.</p>

                            13, <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U.A. Johnson</persName>.</note> stating
                        flatly that Japan did not want any settlement that would result in a
                        Communist <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and that he felt settlement
                        should be based on return to principles 1954 Geneva Accords with mutual
                        withdrawal of NVN and American forces. He recognized “full withdrawal”
                        American forces might take period of years. He was ambiguous in responding
                        to my suggestion that Japan say this publicly, but accepted the suggestion
                        that it be said by <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> Ambassador in
                        Vientiane to NVN Ambassador with whom he said a friendly social contact had
                        now been established. I pointed out this should remove a possible impression
                        in Hanoi that Japan was urging us to make peace at any price. He laid strong
                        emphasis upon acceptance of basic relationship with the US, “there is no one
                        else to whom Japan could turn,” by “everyone” in Japan, except <gloss
                            target="#t_JCP1">JCP</gloss>. Our present problem with bases, etc., was
                        only a manifestation of “gap” in Japanese popular understanding of Vietnam
                        war and would disappear when war terminated. He had no specific suggestions
                        on what further could be done on our part to bridge this “gap,” although he
                        felt we had not been successful in getting across point here that our
                        de-escalation by partial bombing halt of NVN had not been matched by any
                        corresponding action on NVN part. I pointed to recent statements by the
                        President, Secy <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, Secy <persName
                            corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> in this regard and failure of
                        Japanese media to give these statements adequate coverage. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> indicated Japan would be prepared to be
                        a “guarantor” under an international guarantee of <gloss target="#t_SVN1"
                            >SVN</gloss> and “would like to consider” sending civil police forces
                        (as opposed to military personnel) if such a role on ground should develop.
                        Japan wanted to do everything within its power to help bring about and
                        maintain peace in Vietnam and would always welcome any suggestions that we
                        may have.</p>
                    <p>3. On other matters I pressed hard on necessity of Japan making up its own
                        mind on what American military presence in this part or world it desired
                        over long run and was really willing to support. <persName corresp="#p_MT3"
                            >Miki</persName> said that in next ten-year time frame while wanting
                        “rationalization and consolidation” of bases, Japan would want effective US
                        military presence in Japan as well as in <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                        >ROK</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. I also pressed hard on necessity of Japan promptly taking initiative in
                        being much more forthcoming on economic and investment <pb n="296"
                            xml:id="pg_296" facs="0332"/>matters to forestall undoubted rise of
                        protectionist pressures in US next year when growing gap in trade balance
                        became evident.</p>
                    <p>5. While still hung up on exact language in our reply to <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> on <gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss>
                        visits, we came close to a substantive and procedural agreement that should
                        permit resumption of <gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss> visits next month
                        or two.</p>
                    <p>6. We discussed formulae for making clear intention of two govts to continue
                        security treaty after 1970.</p>
                    <p>7. We confirmed the scenario on Okinawa representation in Diet and agreed to
                        keep on ice for time being any further discussions on return of Okinawa
                        administration.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> was obviously and very usefully
                        impressed at <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss> meeting with deep
                        concern of all other participants over security matters.</p>
                    <p>9. I was not able to get any commitment on timing of Japanese signature of
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> although they are still moving in
                        that direction. End summary.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> opened the discussion with a
                        broad statement on the acceptance by everyone in Japan (except Communists)
                        of the fundamental problem in our relations except that for the time being
                        problems with respect to our military bases here came primarily from the
                        “gap” in general Japanese lack of understanding of the Vietnam war. While
                        “politicians” and those in the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                        understood and supported our objective of preventing a Communist take-over
                        of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, this view was not generally shared
                        in the country. This “gap” could best be closed by concluding the war in
                        Vietnam, which would then leave no serious problem between the two
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>11. This led to a long discussion of Vietnam during the course of which I
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> what we could do to close
                        the gap. He then outlined a “peace plan” which I pointed out was almost
                        exactly what we had been repeatedly urging publicly and privately for years.
                        This in turn led to my suggestion they make their position clear to Hanoi
                        through the contact he said they had established in Vientiane. During the
                        course of this discussion, on a personal basis, I challenged his assertion
                        that Hanoi now realized that it could not achieve its objective in <gloss
                            target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and was genuinely looking for a way of
                        making peace. I said it was my own feeling that Hanoi had not yet arrived at
                        this stage but was still hoping domestic and international pressures would
                        force a reversal of US policy. Thus anything Japan could do to disabuse
                        Hanoi of this notion was biggest contribution Japan could now make to
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>12. Also during discussion of Vietnam he agreed that, while <gloss
                            target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> who laid down their arms should be able to
                        participate in peaceful political process, it was entirely unrealistic to
                        urge a “coalition” with armed <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and NLF
                        elements dedicated to the destruction of the government in which they were
                        participation.</p>
                    <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0333"/>
                    <p>13. In response to his question, I bluntly stated that, looked at from
                        standpoint of US, biggest basic threat to Japanese-US relations was feeling
                        on part of US that after sacrificing thousands of lives and billions of
                        dollars in defense of areas of East Asia, an area which is at least of equal
                        interest to Japan, we not only did not get any understanding from Japan but
                        received criticism and harassment on essentially minor matters. I felt that
                        if our future relationship was going to develop in a constructive manner, it
                        was important that the American people get a sense that Japan was bearing a
                        responsibility commensurate with its growing power. Rather than continuing
                        to seek to be treated by the US as a minor and weak country, our
                        relationship needed to be more firmly established on the basis of equality
                        in all fields, including economic.</p>
                    <p>14. In the security field speaking as an American citizen rather than an
                        Ambassador under instructions, it was my personal conviction that, looking
                        at the long run, the American people would not be willing to maintain a
                        major military presence in this part of the world unless they were convinced
                        it was genuinely desired and supported by the people of the area, above all
                        by Japan. Thus, I felt it important Japan reach its own decision on what
                        kind of an American military presence it desired in the light of its own
                        estimate of its own national interests and what it was willing to do to make
                        that presence possible and to support it. The two countries would then have
                        a sound basis for discussing these matters.</p>
                    <p>15. In the economic field, I said it is important that Japan now anticipate
                        and take measures that would help forestall protectionist pressures to be
                        expected in the US when the extent of the large and growing trade gap this
                        year between the two countries became evident. The US administration had
                        taken a unified strong, consistent line against protectionist measures but
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> was badly split by Miti's
                        protectionist attitudes. I questioned whether this was in Japan's long-term
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> took this in good spirit and
                        said he thought my remarks should be used “as a basis for discussions in the
                        govt.” He had also read and correctly interpreted speech which I recently
                        gave to Japanese Junior Chamber of Commerce as having same implication in
                        both security and economic fields.</p>
                    <p>17. In reply to my question as to whether during the next ten years we should
                        expect to be harassed on our bases here and in Okinawa, to the point that
                        our position would become untenable, <persName corresp="#p_MT3"
                            >Miki</persName> said that he definitely felt that this would not be the
                        case. Citing his own and <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> experience in
                        Sasebo and Fukuoka in the July Upper House elections,<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d130fn5">Upper-House elections were held on July 7.</note>
                        <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0334"/>he said he felt Japanese people not
                        only valued security relationship with US but understood and accepted the
                        necessity of base structure. This structure should be “rationalized” and be
                        subject to a clear and better understanding between the two govts than had
                        been the case in the past. In this connection, he said the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> needed to accept more “responsibility.” I,
                        of course, also pointed to the heavy financial costs that would have to be
                        borne by the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> for any relocation of major
                        air bases. <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> said he
                        understood.</p>
                    <p>18. On security treaty, <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> said
                            <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> had decided on policy of
                        continuation of treaty and asked my views on how two govts should make this
                        clear. I pointed out that treaty was of indefinite duration and there was no
                        legal requirement for any action by either govt. We discussed possibility,
                        if PriMin visited US in 1969, of stating intention to continue treaty in
                        joint communiqué. <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> also said that
                        at the regular Diet session beginning next January in response to questions,
                        govt might make some firm and formal statement at that time of intention to
                        continue treaty and queried me whether at that time there could be some
                        response from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in same sense. I pointed
                        out that there would of course be new administration in Washington and was
                        not sure we could work out anything that would fit into their diet
                        timetable, but we promised to keep in touch.</p>
                    <p>19. On Okinawa, he asked my view on another “joint and continuous review”
                        session and I said from my standpoint I had nothing more to say and would
                        prefer to not have such a mtg, but if, for its own purposes, <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> desires such a mtg, I would of course be
                        glad to consider. He indicated that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                        would not have anything to say on “type of bases” (by which he confirmed he
                        meant both freedom of use and storage of nukes) and matter was left
                        open.</p>
                    <p>20. On Okinawa Diet participation, we agreed that October might be best time
                        to announce “agreement in principle” between two govts with details
                        including question of voting rights to be worked out in 1969. (Both of us
                        expressed our unhappiness that Nishime had not stuck to scenario and at
                            <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Matsuoka</persName>'s attempting to hog the

                    <p>21. On <gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss> visits, he said that <gloss
                            target="#t_STA1">STA</gloss> would complete installation of monitoring
                        equipment in first part of September and “organization” in manner that would
                        avoid repetition Sasebo incident. In reply to his question as to whether
                        delivery of our reply on <gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss> visits should
                        be made simultaneously with or prior to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                        announcement of monitoring set up, I said I would abide by his view.
                        However, before giving reply I wanted full briefing on monitoring set up and
                        contemplated arrangements between two govts as well as public handling of
                        any alleged incidents. I said I was not prepared to recommend resumption of
                        visit until I was satisfied set up was such we would not again be victimized
                        by false reports. He said he agreed to arrange to see that I get <pb n="299"
                            xml:id="pg_299" facs="0335"/>this. With respect to our reply, he boggled
                        heavily at “routinely” going back to “normal” or “except in case of
                        emergency.” I explained efforts I had made to obtain mutually acceptable
                        language and said that I had no choice but to insist upon “routinely.” We
                        had long discussion re possible Japanese translations and matter was left
                        that <persName corresp="#p_TFD1">Togo</persName> would try to suggest
                        alternative language although I gave no encouragement that any other
                        language would be acceptable. <persName corresp="#p_TFD1">Togo</persName>
                        felt that delivery of our reply and announcement of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss> monitoring set up should be at same time. I also raised
                        question as to whether <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would wish Sasebo
                        or Yokosuka as port call for first call. <persName corresp="#p_MT3"
                            >Miki</persName> promised to consider.</p>
                    <p>22. On Kawashima visit, <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> said that
                        while Kawashima wanted to meet with members of Congress on a “party to
                        party” basis, he realized that, because of campaigning, Congressmen might
                        not be available and therefore <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName>
                        had suggested that he see Secy <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. A
                        request for this had been made through the Japanese Embassy in Washington. I
                        said I was having Kawashima to lunch before he left.</p>
                    <p>23. We had long discussion on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> security
                        and in reply to my questions, <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName>
                        said that he felt confident Japan would want US to maintain a military
                        presence in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to deter attack as long as
                        present North Korean hostility was evident and that Japan recognized role of
                        bases in Japan and Okinawa in support our forces in <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                            >ROK</gloss>. He said almost all Japanese recognized direct relationship
                            <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> security to that of Japan and in
                        reply to my question said that he had no doubt that in the event of a clear
                        and overt attack by North Korea on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>,
                        Japanese people would fully support military action including action on our
                        part from Japanese bases. However, Japanese did not feel North Korea would
                        launch overt attack against <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, in part
                        because they were “fed up” with Peking, but would continue guerilla action.
                        He said as gesture to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> was “considering sending some rice.” In
                        reply to my question as to whether Japan could not do something in
                        non-lethal military or police type aid he was very ambiguous but admitted to
                        psychological value such gesture would have in <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                            >ROK</gloss> “if it could be done without arousing opposition in Japan.”
                        In this connection he recognized that there was a “gap” between Korean and
                        Japanese feelings with Korea feeling that it was “defending Japan at the
                        38th parallel.” I said I agreed that there was such a gap.</p>
                    <p>24. In reply to my query as to “when they were going to sign the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>,” <persName corresp="#p_MT3"
                            >Miki</persName> said they were still engaged in “education process”
                        vis-á-vis industry as well as the people. There was still considerable
                        feeling that Japan would be subject to considerable inequality in inspection
                        by <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> as compared with Euratom as well as
                        concern over use of “peaceful explosions.” Looking me in the eye, he said
                        that “even if we delay in signing the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>,
                        Japan will not develop nuclear weapons.”</p>
                    <p>25. In various contexts throughout conversation <persName corresp="#p_MT3"
                            >Miki</persName> laid much emphasis upon Japan accepting more
                        “responsibility” and standing on <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0336"
                        />its own feet avoiding impression it was dancing to US tune as best means
                        of maintaining good long-term relations with US. However, he was never
                        specific as to how he envisaged this being implemented. I said I, of course,
                        agreed as this fitted in with my own thoughts on more equality in our
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>26. At his own initiative, <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> chatted
                        about <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss> mtg indicating his principal
                        impression was high degree of emphasis by other countries on “security.” He
                        was very favorably impressed with new <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                        Foreign Minister, said that Thanat Khoman was, of course, very “clever” and
                        at this mtg went out of of his way to support every position taken by
                            <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> but that <gloss
                            target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Foreign Minister was “very tough,” pushing
                        hard on the security matters and proposal to draft an <gloss
                            target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss> charter. Hasluch seemed to appreciate
                            <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName>'s speaking against such a
                        charter.</p>
                    <p>27. In response to my question <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName>
                        said Japanese generally viewed Czech-Soviet developments as evidence of
                        desirable change in world toward “democratization and liberalization” in
                        response to humanistic forces which Soviets were unable to suppress by

                            among every Japanese party, although the left does not of course draw

                    <p>On September 26, 1968, Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> and Admiral
                        John</p>
                    <p>S. McCain, Jr., submitted their report entitled “Review of U.S. Bases in
                        Japan,” which contained recommendations on a total of 54 installations
                        covering approximately 45 thousand acres of land. The recommendations for
                        full or partial release to Japan would realize an estimated reduction of
                        just over $2.6 million in U.S. balance of payments. Proposed changes in the
                        base structure were divided into four categories designating those
                        facilities to be completely released to Japan, partially released to Japan,
                        released to Japan with U.S. joint-usage rights, and relocated within Japan
                        at Japanese expense. The package would be implemented within three years,
                        subject to the terms of bilateral agreements. The report was submitted to
                        the appropriate offices within the Department of Defense and the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff, and its recommendations were accepted with slight

                    <p>Out of concern about “gold losses and the size of the Defense budget,” as
                        well as from a desire to reduce the number of military facilities on the

                                that the Japanese Prime Minister (probably <persName

                                Washington some time in 1969 to set a date for reversion. If such a
                                visit were made, it would be impossible for the Prime Minister to
                                return without an agreement having to do with the subject.</item>

                            <item>Since it was now so clearly understood between the <gloss

                                    >GOJ</gloss> that the 1970 review period on the treaty would
                                pass without action on either side, this meant that the
                                Socialists—who are in any event in disarray—would have no specific
                                event to attack in 1970 (i.e., no Diet action). Hence, their whole
                                attention was focused on stirring up the issue within Okinawa. (He
                                did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get into the question of this fall's
                                elections in Okinawa, strikingly enough.)</item>

                            <item>From this view of the situation and the timing, he said that in
                                his considered judgment the Japanese Government could not, during
                                1969, agree to our having the right to station nuclear weapons in
                                Okinawa without prior consultation. He said that the question of the
                                right to operate into Southeast Asia, or even to launch combat
                                operations directly from Okinawa, without prior consultation would
                                probably not be difficult—but that he flatly could foresee no
                                likelihood at all that a <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> during
                                1969 could meet our present requirements on the nuclear

                            <item>He then asked whether it would be possible for us to accept some
                                form of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> undertaking as to
                                granted approval, as a practical matter, whenever prior consultation
                                was required. I asked whether he meant blanket approval, and he said
                                that he was not going this far, but was suggesting a clear
                                undertaking that in certain categories and types of situations
                                approval would be granted pretty much as a matter of course.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>As a second alternative, he suggested the possibility of reaching
                                agreement during 1969 for a conditional reversion to take place in
                                    <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0339"/>1972—the condition
                                being that before that time we would agree on the situations
                                requiring prior consultation under the treaty. (I again
                                cross-examined to be perfectly clear that he was talking about a
                                conditional reversion in this sense, and not an unconditional
                                undertaking to revert under whatever might be agreed. He readily
                                recognized the impossibility of the latter.)</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>Having heard him out, I then said that I assumed that these thoughts were not
                        wholly his own individual ones. He said that my assumption was correct, and
                        that he believed himself to be reflecting the views of the Prime Minister
                        and senior people in the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>, for whom he
                        was acting as a confidential adviser on this issue. (While he did not put
                        this statement or otherwise claim to be bearing an express message from
                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>, my interpretation would be
                        that he was on an authorized sounding mission.)<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2"

                            <item>I accepted his first paragraph, and said that we already had in
                                mind a strong recommendation to the new administration that it plan
                                on such a visit.</item>

                                <p>As noted above, I cross-examined vigorously on whether he thought
                                    the nuclear issue would really be impossible to handle next year
                                    for the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. I asked, for
                                    example, whether what he was saying was, in effect, that
                                        <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s strong effort
                                    of last winter, the various incidents, and the July elections,
                                    and all else now added up to the clear conclusion that <persName
                                        corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> simply could not sell the
                                    Japanese public adequately on the nuclear issue. His answer to
                                    this question was categorically affirmative. He went on to say
                                    that the issue simply remained too sensitive to see any
                                    possibility at the present time of the Japanese giving any
                                    ground on it.</p>
                                <p>He then asked what I thought our position would be on this issue.
                                    I of course said that I could not speak for a successor
                                    administration. However, even though all of us could foresee a
                                    possible decline in the military requirement for nuclear weapons
                                    in Okinawa, the plain fact was that we could not see the
                                    Pentagon, the White House, or the key leaders in the Congress
                                    giving up the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to have them there
                                    and without prior consultation. In other words, I was sure that
                                    this was the <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0340"/>present
                                    position, and my personal forecast was that it was 90 percent
                                    likely to be the case a year from now.<note n="3"
                                        xml:id="d132fn3">

                                        also agreed “that a Japanese Government will not by 1969 be
                                        able to bite the bullet of nuclear storage on Okinawa.”
                                            <persName>Johnson</persName> also pointed out his
                                        impression “that while the Japanese tend somewhat lightly to
                                        dismiss it, the issue of ‘free use’ is in many ways more
                                        important and fundamental than the issue of nuclear weapons.
                                        It seems to be hard for any country, and particularly now
                                        the third largest economic power in the world, in effect, to
                                        turn over to another power, determination of war and peace
                                        as far as its own territory is concerned, for this in fact
                                        is what is involved in the issue of ‘free use.’” He thought
                                        the solution to the matter depended on the “political
                                        climate within the United States,” which was dependent on
                                        the situation in Vietnam. (Ibid.)</note>

                            <item>As to his proposal in paragraph 4 of his presentation, I said I
                                would not exclude it completely, but thought it would be extremely
                                difficult to arrange on a satisfactory and continuing basis.</item>

                            <item>As to a deal for contingent reversion in 1972, I gave the same
                                general reply. I agreed with his point that between 1969 and 1972
                                there might well be significant developments in the area that would
                                either put the need for nuclear stationing on Okinawa on a much
                                higher plane (defense against Chinese Communist missiles was his
                                example), or reduce it to the point where we could let it go. At the
                                same time, I said that such a contingent reversion deal might in
                                fact arouse sharply different expectations in the two countries—with
                                people in Japan expecting sure-fire agreement on the conditions, but
                                no such belief prevailing in key quarters here. He acknowledged this
                                danger. Incidentally, I specifically asked whether he was mentioning
                                1972 because this would clearly be the limit of the authority of our
                                President as of 1969, and he said that this was indeed the reason
                                for selecting this date. I gave him my own personal view that we
                                should be busting a button to get the thing really settled by
                                then.</item>

                    <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex</persName>, I might add that I told
                        him that, while I was a political animal myself, I did not look at our
                        relations with Japan as being in any sense a partisan issue. I said that
                        with you in Tokyo and <persName>Dick Sneider</persName> here, we should be
                        able to stay in very close touch with the Japanese at the professional
                        level, and that I had every hope that the transition to whomever would be
                        the next President would go with great smoothness.</p>

                    <p>The situation on Okinawa and in Japan was further affected by the appointment
                        of a new High Commissioner for the Ryukyu Islands. In early November the
                        Department of Defense decided to replace <persName corresp="#p_UGFT1"
                            >General Unger</persName> with General <persName>James B.
                            Lampert</persName>, but first announced its decision on November 21. The
                        news came as a complete surprise to the High Commissioner, the Embassy, and
                        the Japanese and Ryukyuan governments and populace. Ambassador
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> notified Washington <pb n="308"
                            xml:id="pg_308" facs="0344"/>that the unanticipated announcement, for
                        which no advance notice had been given, created widespread astonishment. He
                        admitted his inability “to conceive of anything more ill-timed and
                        calculated to be misinterpreted both here and in Okinawa.” Not only did it
                        undercut the carefully constructed relationship <persName corresp="#p_UGFT1"
                            >General Unger</persName> had built with new Chief Executive <persName
                            corresp="#p_YC1">Yara</persName> and with the Japanese Government, the
                        Ambassador believed, but the change also gave rise to a sense that the
                        United States planned to adopt a hard line toward Okinawa in response to the
                            <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yara</persName> victory and served to
                        strengthen sentiments for reversion. Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName>
                        added that he personally found “it hard, and the Japanese will find it
                        equally hard, to credit that those dealing with these matters really attach
                        the importance that we say we attach to Okinawa, when we deal with an
                        appointment as sensitive and fraught with consequences as this as if it were
                        a change of division commanders.” (Exchange of letters between Secretary

                            restrictions on its Ryukyuan bases identical to those governing its
                            bases on Japanese territory under the terms of the Security Treaty.

                        that we have reached the point of no return on the reversion issue. The

                        see virtually no hope of stalling off beyond the end of next year a decision
                        on the timing of reversion, although the actual return would take place
                            later.<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">In a meeting with <persName

                            thereafter and by deferring the question of U.S. base rights.

                        solution covering our post-reversion base rights than we were a year

                    <p>Once again, <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> has easily overcome
                        the threats to his power from his rivals within the Party and has put into
                        office a cabinet, which is by far the ablest and most understanding of the
                        vitals of U.S.-Japanese relations. But, the strength of <persName
                            corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>'s position can prove to be transitory:
                        he is an acknowledged lame duck and the consequential intra-party
                        maneuvering to succeed him has only now begun. Furthermore, by publicly
                        committing his regime to solution of the Okinawa problem, he has given his
                        rivals within the party and his foes outside the party a major test of
                        success.</p>
                    <p>With the onset of 1969, there is no doubt that Okinawa is the number one
                        national issue in Japan. It may be argued that <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName> placed himself in his present predicament of needing an
                        agreement with the U.S. on Okinawa during 1969 by stressing the issue over
                        the past few years. However, for better or worse, he has done so. I think
                        his political judgment was probably sound and that any effort to play down
                        the issue <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0347"/>would have handed his
                        opposition an even stronger point of attack. In any event, not only
                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> but the conservatives and
                        their U.S. alliance policy could well be at stake in the forthcoming effort
                        to resolve the Okinawa issue.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> continues to proceed cautiously
                        in working out his plans on Okinawa. Neither he nor the Foreign Office has
                        reached any conclusion on <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> policy towards
                        post-reversion base rights—although all are overwhelmingly aware that an
                        offer of continued nuclear storage could be political suicide. The Foreign
                        Office is toying with some concept of conventional free use but has not
                        thought through the details, particularly how to sell it to the Japanese
                        public. In fact, there appears to be a conscious effort to avoid deciding
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> position until the new U.S.
                        Administration is thoroughly tested. Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName>
                        keeps reminding the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>, on the other hand,
                        that it must first think through its policies in terms of a realistic
                        assessment of the security needs of Japan and the countries adjacent to
                        Japan whose security is vital to it.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, the <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> Government is
                        trying to clear the decks on all other U.S.-Japan issues and develop a
                        package of “helpful” actions in Asia which will sweeten the Okinawan package
                        for us. Typically, a small hint by Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName>
                        to Vice Minister <persName corresp="#p_UN1">Ushiba</persName> that the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> might give consideration to how it
                        would participate in the defense of the Ryukyus after reversion sent <gloss

                        Okinawa to study the problem.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese are, thus, in the preparatory phase of policy making and not
                        moving precipitously. Their timetable calls for careful soundings throughout
                        the spring and summer, to be followed by a summit meeting in Washington in
                        the fall. They have accepted the wisdom of not pushing the new
                        Administration for an immediate decision on the Ryukyus, but are worried
                        lest it be put off too far and bring them into 1970 without an
                        agreement.</p>

                    <p>The new factor in the Okinawa reversion equation is the pressures developing
                        within Okinawa on reversion. In the past, it has been the implicit
                        assumption of both ourselves and the Japanese that the big boys (the U.S.
                        and Japan) will settle the problem and the Okinawans will docilely accept
                        our joint decision. This assumption can no longer be counted upon. The
                        Okinawan intrusion into the reversion negotiations can come in two ways,
                        through agitation leading to open incidents with U.S. forces, and through
                        the evangelistic pressures for action on the part of the new Chief

                    <p>The potential for an incident involving an open clash between demonstrators
                        and American military forces protecting our bases is much higher today than

                    <p>In this climate, our insistence upon exercising our unrestricted rights for

                        not only a focal point for potentially dangerous demonstrations, but further
                        an incentive to seek as soon as possible reversion of Okinawa at the
                        “homeland level” where the Japanese Government will “protect” the Okinawans

                        <persName corresp="#p_YC1">Yara</persName>, moreover, has cast himself as
                        the confirmed and authentic spokesman of Okinawan reversion sentiments. In
                        his grand tour of Japan, he constantly pushed the theme of early reversion.
                        But, of even more concern to us is his effort at the same time to inject
                        himself into the debate on the conditions for reversion. <persName
                            corresp="#p_YC1">Yara</persName> has publicly urged not only “homeland
                        level” but a thinning out of U.S. bases. He has made it clear that he, as
                        Okinawa's elected leader, is going to resist efforts to ignore the Okinawan
                        view on post-reversion U.S. base rights.</p>
                    <p>Thus, it is not impossible that the pace of events in Okinawa could press the
                        Japanese Government to accelerate its current timetable. Certainly, an
                        incident involving a clash between demonstrators and U.S. military guards
                        around bases will put the Japanese Government on a very difficult spot. The
                        spectre of such a development constantly plagues the Foreign Office and
                        other Japanese officials.<note n="3" xml:id="d138fn3">

                    </p>
                    <p>Outside the Okinawan issue, there are some encouraging notes of progress in
                        resolving current U.S.-Japan problems, particularly with respect to trade
                        restrictions against U.S. imports, and the reasonably quiet visit of the
                        nuclear sub. In very large part these actions taken by the Japanese are in
                        their own self-interest and cued to clearing the decks for a favorable
                        decision on reversion. But, they also reflect the dedication of the current
                        leadership to maintaining a close relationship with us. Symptomatically,
                        after lengthy consideration, the Japanese Government has accepted our offer
                        for space cooperation rather than going it alone.</p>
                    <p>However, below the surface there are bubblings of serious discontent from
                        within the ranks of the next generation of leaders about the character of
                        the U.S.-Japan alliance and Japan's great dependence on the U.S. These
                        younger men are not necessarily dissatisfied with a partnership with the
                        U.S. but are concerned that the present relationship gives too little
                        freedom to the new Japanese nationalism—a vague and still far from
                        well-defined concept. They are not now seeking or even necessarily desirous
                        of a break with the U.S. and embarking on a de Gaullist path. They do look
                        for a new relationship with the U.S. by 1980 which meets their principal
                        criterion of “equality” with us. In the context of this new nationalism,
                        Okinawa has become a serious test of U.S. willingness to treat Japan on more
                        equal terms.</p>

                    <p>212. 1. My hour and one-half follow-up talk with FonMin <persName
                            corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName> on Okinawa yesterday afternoon was
                        most interesting and represented a great advance in <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss>'s coming to grips with hard realities of Okinawa situation.
                        In brief, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName> “personally and
                        informally” suggested possibility of a formula under which bases on Okinawa
                        would “in principle” revert to “homeland level” at time of reversion of
                        administrative rights; but it would be agreed that they would “temporarily”
                        retain their present status with respect to “freedom of use” and nuclear
                        storage until such time as both governments agree that situation in area has
                        changed sufficiently for better to permit “homeland level.” <persName
                            corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName> said he felt it would be possible to
                        sell such a formula in Japan only on basis it would bring about prompt
                        reversion of administrative rights. It was his judgment that longer
                        reversion was put off, the less freedom of action <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss> was going to have as pressures on subject continue to build
                        up. I told him that my personal reaction was that formula was very
                        interesting and certainly worth further study by both governments.</p>
                    <p>2. During course of conversation <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName>
                        made it very clear that nuclear storage issue, even under above formula,
                        presented great difficulties to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>, and
                        statements by many prominent Americans that nuclear storage on Okinawa was
                        no longer necessary because of development of Polaris, Poseidon etc. made it
                        very difficult for <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to grapple with
                        question, as it did not have sufficient understanding of what weapons or
                        what purposes were involved.<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName> met with

                            hours. <persName>Johnson</persName> pointed out the need to maintain
                            effective use of bases on Okinawa after reversion, particularly to meet
                            potential threats posed by North Korea and Communist China. In response
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> commented “that <gloss

                                [<persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>] said that <gloss

                            (non-possession, non-production and non-introduction) were ‘nonsense.’
                            However, this should not be interpreted to mean Japan wants to have
                            nuclear weapons.” (Telegram 267 from Tokyo, January 14; ibid., <gloss

                        <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName> asked whether <gloss

                        of our legislation, of doing this and said, in any event, I really doubted
                        how much help it <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0351"/>would be. I had
                        previously discussed with him and other members of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss> the whole concept of importance of graduated deterrence
                        both in nuclear and conventional fields, and what was involved was question
                        of principle rather than operational details. If Japan were to accept
                        storage of nuclear weapons on its territory and was politically able to
                        enter into necessary agreement with US for exchange of information, we would
                        then be able to go into more detail and perhaps move toward relationship in
                        this field comparable to what we have with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> countries. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName>
                        said this of course was not possible for <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                        >GOJ</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. Apart from formula mentioned in first paragraph above and our discussion
                        of nuclear matters, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName> suggested
                        possibility with respect to “free use” of giving US a formula of “free use”
                        of Okinawa for support of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces in Korea,
                        which could be made public without surfacing our present secret
                        understanding with respect to our bases in Japan. In this regard he said
                        that <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and he were, in event of
                        renewal of hostilities in Korea, absolutely determined to implement this
                        secret understanding and give full support to our actions in Korea. He also
                        said that both he and <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> fully
                        recognized importance of our bases in Okinawa remaining “effective” and were
                        determined to do their best to find a formula under which this could be
                        done.</p>
                    <p>4. He made no mention whatever of <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                        >Sato</persName>'s previous formula of “setting the date and then
                        negotiating the conditions,” and I am hopeful that they have now decided to
                        get off this hook. He did reiterate <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Sato</persName>'s desire to go to Washington in November “to settle”
                        the Okinawa issue. He also reiterated his hope for cabinet-committee meeting
                        in Japan in summer at which he could discuss Okinawa issue with Secretary

                            still wanted to reach agreement on a timetable for settlement and
                            reversion, and he “excluded nuclear weapons on Okinawa for the long
                            pull.” <persName>Rostow</persName> presented the U.S. view that an
                            agreement on reversion necessitated that Japan must “deliver—not
                            promise—more muscle in Asia and the Pacific” by assuming a larger
                            economic and security role in the region. (Memorandum of conversation,

                        was an official invitation to the new administration and that <gloss

                        deliver on a formula such as set forth para one above, but entirely agree
